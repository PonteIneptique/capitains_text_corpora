There is nothing\u2014no pain, no ruin, no shame, nor dishonor\u2014that I have not\n seen in your sufferings and mine. And now what is this new edict that\n they say the general has just decreed to all the city? Do you know\n anything? Have you heard? Or does it escape you that evils from our enemies are on the march against\n our friends? \n \n \n Ismene \n To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing\n pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in\n one day by a double blow. And since\n the Argive army has fled during\n this night, I have learned nothing further, whether better fortune is\n mine, or further ruin. \n \n \n Antigone \n I knew it well, so I was trying to bring you outside the courtyard gates\n to this end, that you alone might hear. \n \n \n Ismene \n Hear what? It is clear that you are\n brooding on some dark news. \n \n \n Antigone \n Why not? Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial,\n the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due observance of\n right and custom, he has laid in the earth for his honor among the dead below. As for the poor\n corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published\n to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead\n leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing store as they look to satisfy their hunger.\n Such, it is said, is the edict that the good Creon has laid down for you\n and for me\u2014yes, for me\u2014and it is said that he is coming here to proclaim\n it for the certain knowledge of those who do not already know. They say\n that he does not conduct this business lightly, but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the\n fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city. This is\n how things stand for you, and so you will soon show your nature, whether\n you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line. \n \n ","1":"\n \n Ismene \n Poor sister, if things have come to this, what would I profit by loosening or tightening this knot? \n \n \n Antigone \n Consider whether you will share the toil and the task. \n \n \n Ismene \n What are you hazarding? What do you intend? \n \n \n Antigone \n Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse? \n \n \n Ismene \n You plan to bury him\u2014when it is forbidden to the city? \n \n \n Antigone \n Yes, he is my brother, and yours\n too, even if you wish it otherwise. I will never be convicted of\n betraying him. \n \n \n Ismene \n Hard girl! Even when Creon has forbidden it? \n \n \n Antigone \n No, he has no right to keep me from my own. \n \n \n Ismene \n Ah, no! Think, sister, how our father perished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he\n himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand; then\n his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her\n life; lastly, our two brothers\n in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood,\n worked with mutual hands their common doom. And now we, in turn\u2014we two\n who have been left all alone\u2014consider how much more miserably we will be\n destroyed, if in defiance of the law we transgress against an autocrat's decree or his powers. No, we must\n remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not\n suited to battles against men; and next, that we are ruled by the more\n powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more\n stinging. I, therefore, will\n ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey\n those who have come to authority. It is foolish to do what is\n fruitless. \n \n ","2":"\n \n Antigone \n I would not encourage you\u2014no, nor, even if you were willing\n later, would I welcome you as\n my partner in this action. No, be the sort that pleases you. I will bury\n him\u2014it would honor me to die while doing that. I shall rest with him,\n loved one with loved one, a pious criminal. For the time is\n greater that I must serve the\n dead than the living, since in that world I will rest forever. But if\n you so choose, continue to dishonor what the gods in honor have\n established. \n \n \n Ismene \n I do them no dishonor. But to act in violation of the citizens' will\u2014of\n that I am by nature incapable. \n \n \n Antigone \n You can make that your pretext!\n Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love. \n \n \n Ismene \n Oh no, unhappy sister! I fear for you! \n \n \n Antigone \n Do not tremble for me. Straighten out your own destiny. \n \n \n Ismene \n Then at least disclose the deed to no one before you do it. Conceal it, instead, in secrecy\u2014and so,\n too, will I. \n \n \n Antigone \n Go on! Denounce it! You will be far more hated for your silence, if you\n fail to proclaim these things to everyone. \n \n \n Ismene \n You have a hot heart for chilling deeds. \n \n \n Antigone \n I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please. \n \n \n Ismene \n Yes, if you will also have the\n power. But you crave the impossible. \n \n \n Antigone \n Why then, when my strength fails, I will have finished. \n \n \n Ismene \n An impossible hunt should not be tried in the first place. \n \n \n Antigone \n If you mean that, you will have my hatred, and you will be subject to\n punishment as the enemy of the dead. But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this\n terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death\n will lack honor. \n \n \n Ismene \n Go, then, if you so decide. And of this be sure: though your path is\n foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true. Exit\n Antigone on the spectators' left. Ismene exits into the\n palace. \n \n ","3":"\n\n \n \n Enter the Chorus on the right. \n \n Chorus \n Shaft of the sun, fairest light of\n all that have dawned on Thebes of the seven gates, you have shone forth at\n last, eye of golden day, advancing over Dirce's streams! You have goaded with a sharper bit the\n warrior of the white shield, who came from Argos in full armor, driving him to\n headlong retreat. \n \n ","4":"\n \n \n Chorus \n He set out against our land\n because of the strife-filled claims of Polyneices, and like a screaming\n eagle he flew over into our land, covered by his snow-white\n wing, with a mass of weapons\n and crested helmets. \n \n ","5":"\n \n \n Chorus \n He paused above our dwellings; he\n gaped around our sevenfold portals with spears thirsting for blood; but\n he left before his jaws were ever\n glutted with our gore, or before the Fire-god's pine-fed flame had\n seized our crown of towers. So\n fierce was the crash of battle swelling about his back, a match too hard\n to win for the rival of the dragon. \n \n ","6":"\n \n \n Chorus \n For Zeus detests above all the\n boasts of a proud tongue. And when he saw them advancing in a swollen\n flood, arrogant their clanging\n gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to\n shout victory when he had reached our ramparts. \n \n ","7":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Staggered, he fell to the earth\n with a crash, torch in hand, a man\n possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging\n against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate. But his threats did\n not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed\n each their own dooms with hard blows, Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point. \n \n ","8":"\n \n \n Chorus \n For the seven captains, stationed\n against an equal number at the seven gates, left behind their brazen\n arms in tribute to Zeus the turner of battle\u2014all but the accursed pair\n who, born of one father and one mother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who\n now share in a common death. \n \n ","9":"\n \n \n Chorus \n But since Victory whose name is\n glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich\n Thebes , let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after\n the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long\n dance and song. And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes , rule our dancing! \n \n ","10":"\n \n \n Chorus \n But look, the king of the land is\n coming here, Creon, the son of Menoeceus, our new ruler in accordance\n with the new circumstances fated by the gods. What policy is he setting\n in motion, that he has proposed\n this special conference of elders, and summoned it by a general\n mandate? \n \n ","11":"\n\n \n Enter Creon, with two attendants. \n \n Creon \n My fellow citizens! First, the\n gods, after tossing the fate of our city on wild waves, have once more\n righted it. Second, I have ordered you through my messengers to come\n here apart from all the rest,\n because I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the\n power of the throne of Laius; how, again, you were reverent, when\n Oedipus was guiding our city; and lastly, how, when he was dead, you\n still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children. Since, then, these latter have fallen in one\n day by a twofold doom\u2014each striking, each struck, both with the stain of\n a brother's murder\u2014I now possess all the power and the throne according\n to my kinship with the dead. Now,\n it is impossible to know fully any man's character, will, or judgment,\n until he has been proved by the test of rule and law-giving. For if\n anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to the best and wisest\n plans, but because of some\n fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long\n been the most cowardly traitor. And if any man thinks a friend more\n important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account. Zeus,\n god who sees all things always, be my witness\u2014 I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety,\n marching upon the citizens. Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile\n to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country\n is the ship that bears us safe, and that only when we sail her on a straight course can we make\n true friends. Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city. Akin\n to these is the edict which I have now published to the citizenry\n concerning the sons of Oedipus: Eteocles, who fell fighting in behalf of our city and who excelled\n all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that\n descends to the noblest of the dead below. But as for his brother,\n Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the\n ground the city of his fathers\n and his race's gods, and wanted to feed on kindred blood and lead the\n remnant into slavery\u2014it has been proclaimed to the city that no one\n shall give him funeral honors or lamentation, but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame,\n with his body there for birds and dogs to eat. This is my will, and\n never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just. But\n whoever has good will to Thebes , he shall\n be honored by me in death as in life. \n \n ","12":"\n \n Chorus \n That is your will, Creon, towards this city's enemy and its friend. And\n the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law whatsoever, both\n concerning the dead and all us who live. \n \n \n Creon \n See, then, that you be guardians\n of my commands. \n \n \n Chorus \n Lay the weight of this task on some younger man. \n \n \n Creon \n That is not what I meant\u2014the guards for the corpse are already in\n place. \n \n \n Chorus \n Then what is this other command that you would give? \n \n \n Creon \n That you not give way to the breakers of my commands. \n \n \n Chorus \n There is no one so foolish as to\n crave death. \n \n \n Creon \n I assure you, that is the wage for disobedience. Yet by just the hope of\n it, money has many times corrupted men. \n \n Enter Guard. \n \n Guard \n My king, I will not say that I arrive breathless because of speed, or\n from the action of a swift foot. For often I brought myself to a stop because of my thoughts, and\n wheeled round in my path to return. My mind was telling me many things:\n \u201cFool, why do you go to where your arrival will mean your punishment?\u201d\n \u201cIdiot, are you dallying again? If Creon learns it from another, must\n you not suffer for it?\u201d So\n debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was\n made long. At last, however, the view prevailed that I should come\n here\u2014to you. Even if my report brings no good, still will I tell\n you, since I come with a good\n grip on one hope, that I can suffer nothing except what is my fate. \n \n ","13":"\n \n Creon \n And what is it that so disheartens you? \n \n \n Guard \n I want to tell you first about myself\u2014I did not do the deed, nor did I\n see the doer, so it would be wrong\n that I should come to any harm. \n \n \n Creon \n Like a bowman you aim well at your target from a distance, and all around\n you hedge yourself off well from the deed. It is clear that you have\n some unheard-of thing to tell. \n \n \n Guard \n That I do, for terrible news imposes great hesitation. \n \n \n Creon \n Then tell it, will you, and so unburdened go away? \n \n \n Guard \n Well, here it is. The corpse\u2014some\n one has just given it burial and disappeared after sprinkling thirsty\n dust on the flesh and performing the other rites that piety demands. \n \n \n Creon \n What are you saying? What man dared do this? \n \n \n Guard \n I do not know. For there was no scar of a pickax to be seen\n there, no earth thrown up by a\n mattock. The ground was hard and dry, unbroken, not rolled over by\n wheels. The doer was someone who left no trace. When the first\n day-watchman showed it to us, a discomforting amazement fell on us\n all. The dead man was veiled\n from us\u2014not shut within a tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him, as\n if put there by the hand of one who shunned a curse. And no sign was\n visible that any beast of prey or any dog had approached or torn him.\n Then evil words flew thick and loud among us, guard accusing guard. It would even have come to blows\n in the end, nor was there anyone there to prevent it: every man was the\n culprit, and no one was plainly guilty, while all disclaimed knowledge\n of the act. We were ready to take red-hot iron in our hands, to walk through fire and to swear oaths\n by the gods that we had neither done the deed, nor shared knowledge of\n the planning or the doing. At last, when our investigating got us\n nowhere, someone spoke up and made us all bend our faces in fear towards the earth. For we did\n not know how we could argue with him, nor yet prosper, if we did what he\n said. His argument was that the deed must be reported to you and not\n hidden. This view prevailed, and so it was that the lot doomed miserable me to win this prize. So here\n I stand, as unwelcome to you as I am unwilling, I well know. For no man\n delights in the bearer of bad news. \n \n ","14":"\n \n Chorus \n My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is\n somehow the work of gods? \n \n \n Creon \n Quiet, before your words truly\n fill me with rage, so that you not be found at the same time foolish as\n well as old. You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods\n have concern for that corpse. Was it in high esteem for his\n benefactions that they sought\n to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their\n sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? Or\n do you see the gods honoring the wicked? It cannot be. No! From the very\n first certain men of the city\n were chafing at this edict and muttering against me, tossing their heads\n in secret, and they did not keep their necks duly under the yoke in\n submission to me. By those men, I am certain, they were led astray and\n bribed to do this deed. Nothing so\n evil as money ever grew to be current among men. This destroys cities,\n this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to\n set themselves to works of shame, this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of\n unholiness. But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure\n that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment. Now, as Zeus\n still has my reverence, know this well\u2014 I tell you on my oath. If you do not find the very hand\n that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall\n not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this\n outrage plain, so that hereafter\n you may thieve with better knowledge of where your money should be\n received from, and learn that it is best not to be fond of money-making\n from any and every source. For you will find that ill-gotten gains bring\n more men to ruin than to safety. \n \n ","15":"\n \n Guard \n Will you allow me to speak? Or\n shall I just turn and go? \n \n \n Creon \n Do you not know even now how much your voice sickens me? \n \n \n Guard \n Is the pain in your ears, or in your soul? \n \n \n Creon \n And why would you define the seat of my pain? \n \n \n Guard \n He who did it hurts your heart, but I, your ears. \n \n \n Creon \n God! How plain it is that you are\n a born babbler. \n \n \n Guard \n Perhaps, but never the author of this action. \n \n \n Creon \n Yes, and what is more, you sold your life for silver. \n \n \n Guard \n Ah! It is truly sad when the judge judges wrong . \n \n \n Creon \n Expound on \u201cjudgment\u201d as you will. But, if you fail to show me the perpetrators of these crimes, you\n will avow that money basely earned wreaks sorrows. Exit\n Creon. \n \n \n Guard \n Well, may the man be found! That would be best. But, whether he be caught\n or not\u2014for fortune must decide that\u2014I assure you that you will not see\n me come here again. Saved just now\n beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks. Exit the\n Guard. \n \n ","16":"\n\n \n \n \n Chorus \n Wonders are many, and none is more\n wonderful than man. This power\n spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the\n south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.\n Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the\n unwearied, he wears away to\n his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows\n weave to and fro year after year. \n \n ","17":"\n \n \n Chorus \n The light-hearted tribe of\n birds and the clans of wild\n beasts and the sea-brood of the deep he snares in the meshes of his\n twisted nets, and he leads them captive, very-skilled man. He masters by\n his arts the beast who dwells in\n the wilds and roams the hills. He tames the shaggy-maned horse, putting\n the yoke upon its neck, and tames the tireless mountain bull. \n \n ","18":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Speech and thought fast as\n the wind and the moods that\n give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows\n of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the\n storming rain. He has resource for\n everything. Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must\n come. From Death alone he shall procure no escape, but from baffling\n diseases he has devised flights. \n \n ","19":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Possessing resourceful skill, a\n subtlety beyond expectation he moves now to evil, now to good. When he\n honors the laws of the land and the justice of the gods to which he is\n bound by oath, his city prospers.\n But banned from his city is he who, thanks to his rashness, couples with\n disgrace. Never may he share my home, never think my thoughts, who does these things! \n \n ","20":"\n \n Enter the Guard, on the spectators' left, leading in Antigone. \n \n Chorus \n What marvel sent by the gods is\n this?\u2014I am bewildered! I know her. How can I deny that this girl is\n Antigone? O unhappy child of your\n unhappy father, of Oedipus! What can this mean? What! Surely they are\n not bringing you captive for disobeying the King's laws and being caught\n in lunacy? \n \n ","21":"\n\n \n \n Guard \n Here is she, the one who did the deed. We caught this one burying him. Where is Creon? \n \n Enter Creon from the palace. \n \n Chorus \n There, he is coming from the house again at our need. \n \n \n Creon \n What is it? What has happened that makes my coming timely? \n \n \n Guard \n My king, there is nothing that a man can rightly swear he will not do.\n For second thought belies one's first intent. I could have vowed that I would not ever come here\n again, because of your threats by which I had just been storm-tossed.\n But since this joy that exceeds and oversteps my hopes can be compared\n in fulness to no other pleasure, I am back\u2014though it is contrary to my\n sworn oath\u2014 bringing this girl who\n was caught giving burial honors to the dead. This time there was no\n casting of lots. No, this piece of luck has fallen to me, and me alone.\n And now, my king, as it pleases you, take her yourself, question her and\n convict her. But justice would see me released free and clear from this trouble. \n \n \n Creon \n Your prisoner here\u2014how and where did you take her? \n \n \n Guard \n She was burying the man. You know all there is to tell. \n \n \n Creon \n Are you clear and sure about what you are saying? \n \n \n Guard \n I am. I saw her burying the corpse that you had forbidden to bury. Is that plain and\n sufficient? \n \n \n Creon \n And how was she observed? How taken in the act? \n \n ","22":"\n \n Guard \n It happened like this. When we had come to the place with those fierce\n threats of yours still in our ears, we swept away all the dust that\n covered the corpse and bared\n the damp body well. We then sat down on the brow of the hill to\n windward, fleeing the smell from him, lest it strike us. Each man was\n wide awake and kept his neighbor alert with torrents of threats, if any\n one should be careless of this task. So time passed, until the disk of the sun stood bright\n in mid-sky and the heat began to burn. And then suddenly a whirlwind\n lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a trouble in the sky, and it\n filled the plain, marring all the foliage of its woods. Soon the wide air was choked with it. We closed\n our eyes, and endured the plague from the gods. When, after a long\n while, this storm had passed, the girl was seen, and she wailed aloud\n with the sharp cry of a grieving bird, as when inside her\n empty nest she sees the bed\n stripped of its nestlings. So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare,\n broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who\n had done it. Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands, and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held\n high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations. We rushed\n forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not\n at all dismayed. We then charged her with her past and present\n doings, but she made no denial\n of anything\u2014at once to my joy and to my pain. For to have escaped from\n trouble one's self gives the greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends\n to evil. Naturally, though, all such things are of less account to me than my own safety. \n \n ","23":"\n \n Creon \n You, you with your face bent to the ground, do you admit, or deny that\n you did this? \n \n \n Antigone \n I declare it and make no denial. \n \n \n Creon \n To the Guard. \n You can take yourself wherever you please, free and clear of a heavy charge. Exit\n Guard. \n \n \n To Antigone. \n You, however, tell me\u2014not at length, but briefly\u2014did you know that an\n edict had forbidden this? \n \n \n Antigone \n I knew it. How could I not? It was public. \n \n \n Creon \n And even so you dared overstep that law? \n \n \n Antigone \n Yes, since it was not Zeus that\n published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which\n Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men. Nor did I\n think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override\n the unwritten and unfailing\n statutes given us by the gods. For their life is not of today or\n yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows when they were first put\n forth. Not for fear of any man's pride was I about to owe a penalty to\n the gods for breaking these. Die I\n must, that I knew well (how could I not?). That is true even without\n your edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain.\n When anyone lives as I do, surrounded by evils, how can he not carry off\n gain by dying? So for me to meet\n this doom is a grief of no account. But if I had endured that my\n mother's son should in death lie an unburied corpse, that would have\n grieved me. Yet for this, I am not grieved. And if my present actions\n are foolish in your sight, it may\n be that it is a fool who accuses me of folly. \n \n ","24":"\n \n Chorus \n She shows herself the wild offspring of a wild father, and does not know\n how to bend before troubles. \n \n \n Creon \n Yet remember that over-hard spirits most often collapse. It is the\n stiffest iron, baked to utter\n hardness in the fire, that you most often see snapped and shivered. And\n I have witnessed horses with great spirit disciplined by a small bit.\n For there is no place for pride, when one is his neighbors'\n slave. This girl was already\n practiced in outrage when she overstepped the published laws. And, that\n done, this now is a second outrage, that she glories in it and exults in\n her deed. In truth, then, I am no man, but she is, if this victory rests with her and brings no\n penalty. No! Whether she is my sister's child, or nearer to me in blood\n than any of my kin that worship Zeus at the altar of our house, she and\n her sister will not escape a doom most harsh. For in truth I charge that other with an equal share\n in the plotting of this burial. Call her out! I saw her inside just now,\n raving, and not in control of her wits. Before the deed, the mind\n frequently is convicted of stealthy crimes when conspirators are\n plotting depravity in the dark. But, truly, I detest it, too, when one who has been caught in\n treachery then seeks to make the crime a glory. \n \n \n Antigone \n What more do you want than to capture and kill me? \n \n \n Creon \n I want nothing else. Having that, I have everything. \n \n ","25":"\n \n Antigone \n Why then do you wait? In none of your maxims is there anything that pleases me\u2014and may there never\n be! Similarly to you as well my views must be displeasing. And yet, how\n could I have won a nobler glory than by giving burial to my own brother?\n All here would admit that they approve, if fear did not grip their tongues.

It is for this that men pray: to sire and raise in their\n homes children who are obedient, that they may requite their father's\n enemy with evil and honor his friend, just as their father\n does. But the man who begets\n unhelpful children\u2014what would you say that he has sown except miseries\n for himself and abundant exultation for his enemies? Never, then, my\n son, banish your reason for pleasure on account of a woman, knowing that this embrace soon becomes\n cold and brittle\u2014an evil woman to share your bed and home. For what\n wound could strike deeper than a false friend? No, spit her out as if\n she were an enemy, let her go find a husband in Hades. For since I caught her alone of all the city in\n open defiance, I will not make myself a liar to my city. I will kill\n her. So let her call on Zeus who protects kindred blood. If I am to\n foster my own kin to spurn order, surely I will do the same for outsiders. For whoever shows his\n excellence in the case of his own household will be found righteous in\n his city as well. But if anyone oversteps and does violence to the laws,\n or thinks to dictate to those in power, such a one will never win praise from me. No, whomever\n the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed in matters small and great\n and in matters just and unjust. And I would feel confident that such a\n man would be a fine ruler no less than a good and willing\n subject, and that beneath a\n hail of spears he would stand his ground where posted, a loyal and brave\n comrade in the battle line. But there is no evil worse than\n disobedience. This destroys cities; this overturns homes; this\n breaks the ranks of allied\n spears into headlong rout. But the lives of men who prosper upright, of\n these obedience has saved the greatest part. Therefore we must defend\n those who respect order, and in no way can we let a woman defeat us.

In any\n case, it is my natural duty to watch on your behalf all that men say, or\n do, or find to blame.

What, indeed, is a nobler\n ornament for children than the fair fame of a thriving father, or for a\n father than that of his children? Do not, then, bear one mood only in yourself: do not think that your\n word and no other, must be right. For if any man thinks that he alone is\n wise\u2014that in speech or in mind he has no peer\u2014such a soul, when laid\n open, is always found empty. No,\n even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things,\n and not to be too rigid. You see how the trees that stand beside the\n torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their\n branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all? And in the same way the pilot who keeps\n the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and\n voyages thereafter with his decking underwater. Father, give way and\n allow a change from your rage. For if even from me, a younger man, a\n worthy thought may be supplied, by\n far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by\n nature.

But when an error is made, that man is\n no longer unwise or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has\n fallen and does not remain stubborn. Self-will, we know, invites the\n charge of foolishness. Concede the claim of the dead. Do not kick at the\n fallen. What prowess is it to\n kill the dead all over again? I have considered for your good, and what\n I advise is good. The sweetest thing is to learn from a good advisor\n when his advice is to your profit. \n \n ","57":"\n \n Creon \n Old man, you all shoot your arrows at me, like archers at their mark, and\n I am not safe even from the\n plottings of the seer's divine art, but by their tribe I have long been\n bought and sold and made their merchandise. Turn your profits, make your\n deals for the white gold of Sardis and the gold of India , if it pleases you, but you shall not cover that\n man with a grave, not even if the\n eagles of Zeus wish to snatch and carry him to be devoured at the god's\n throne. No, not even then, for fear of that defilement will I permit his\n burial, since I know with certainty that no mortal has the power to\n defile the gods. But even the\n exceedingly clever, old Teiresias, falls with a shameful fall, when they\n couch shameful thoughts in fine phrasing for profit's sake. \n \n \n Teiresias \n Alas! Does any man know, does any consider\u2014 \n \n \n Creon \n What is this? What universal truth are you announcing? \n \n \n Teiresias \n \u2014by how much the most precious of\n our possessions is the power to reason wisely? \n \n \n Creon \n By as much, I think, as senselessness is the greatest affliction. \n \n \n Teiresias \n Yet you came into being full of that disease. \n \n \n Creon \n I have no desire to trade insults with the seer. \n \n \n Teiresias \n Yet that is what you do in saying that I prophesy falsely. \n \n \n Creon \n Yes, for the prophet-clan was\n ever fond of money. \n \n \n Teiresias \n And the race sprung from tyrants loves shameful gain. \n \n \n Creon \n Do you know that you ramble so about your king? \n \n \n Teiresias \n I am aware, since through me you have saved this city. \n \n \n Creon \n You are a wise seer, but fond of doing injustice. \n \n \n Teiresias \n You will stir me to utter the\n dire secret in my soul. \n \n \n Creon \n Out with it! But only if it is not for gain that you speak it. \n \n \n Teiresias \n Indeed, I think I speak without mention of gain\u2014where you are\n concerned. \n \n \n Creon \n Be certain that you will not trade in my will. \n \n ","58":"\n \n Teiresias \n Then know, yes, know it well! You will not live through many\n more courses of the sun's\n swift chariot, before you will give in return one sprung from your own\n loins, a corpse in requital for corpses. For you have thrust below one\n of those of the upper air and irreverently lodged a living soul in the\n grave, while you detain in\n this world that which belongs to the infernal gods, a corpse unburied,\n unmourned, unholy. In the dead you have no part, nor do the gods above,\n but in this you do them violence. For these crimes the avenging\n destroyers, the Furies of\n Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for you, waiting to seize you in\n these same sufferings. And look closely if I tell you this with a\n silvered palm. A time not long to be delayed will reveal in your house\n wailing over men and over women. All the cities are stirred up in hostility, whose mangled corpses the\n dogs, or the wild beasts or some winged bird buried, carrying an unholy\n stench to the city that held each man's hearth. There, now, are arrows\n for your heart, since you provoke me, launched at you, archer-like, in my anger. They fly\n true\u2014you cannot run from their burning sting. Boy, lead me home, so that\n he may launch his rage against younger men, and learn to keep a quieter\n tongue and a better mind\n within his breast than he now bears. Exit Teiresias. \n \n ","59":"\n \n Chorus \n The man is gone, my king, leaving dire prophecies behind. And for all the\n time that I have had this hair on my head, now white, once dark, I know\n that he has never been a false prophet to our city. \n \n \n Creon \n I, too, know it well, and my mind\n is troubled. To yield is terrible, but, to resist, to strike my pride\n with ruin\u2014this, too, inspires terror. \n \n \n Chorus \n The moment, Creon, requires that you reason wisely. \n \n \n Creon \n What should I do, then? Speak, and I will obey. \n \n \n Chorus \n Go and free the girl from her\n hollowed chamber. Then raise a tomb for the unburied dead. \n \n \n Creon \n And you recommend this? You think that I should yield? \n \n \n Chorus \n Yes, my king, and with all possible speed. For harms sent from the gods\n swiftly cut short the follies of men. \n \n \n Creon \n Ah, it is a struggle, but I\n depart from my heart's resolve and obey. We must not wage vain wars with\n necessity. \n \n \n Chorus \n Go, do these things and do not leave their performance to others. \n \n \n Creon \n Right away I will go. Go, go, my servants, each and all of you! Take axes\n in your hands, and hurry to that\n place there in view! But since my judgment has taken this turn, I will\n be there to set her free, as I myself confined her. I am held by the\n fear that it is best to keep the established laws to life's very\n end. \n \n ","60":"\n\n \n \n \n Chorus \n God of many names, glory of the\n Cadmeian bride and offspring of loud-thundering Zeus, you who watch over\n far-famed Italy and\n reign in the valleys of\n Eleusinian Deo where all find welcome! O Bacchus, denizen of Thebes , the mother-city of your\n Bacchants, dweller by the wet stream of Ismenus on the soil of the sowing of the savage dragon's\n teeth! \n \n ","61":"\n \n \n Chorus \n The smoky glare of torches sees\n you above the cliffs of the twin peaks, where the Corycian nymphs move\n inspired by your godhead, and\n Castalia's stream sees you, too. The ivy-mantled slopes of Nysa 's hills and the shore green with\n many-clustered vines send you, when accompanied by the cries of your\n divine words, you visit the\n avenues of Thebes . \n \n ","62":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Thebes of all cities you hold foremost in honor,\n together with your lightning-struck mother. And now when the whole city is held subject to a\n violent plague, come, we ask, with purifying feet over steep Parnassus , or over the groaning straits! \n \n ","63":"\n \n \n Chorus \n O Leader of the chorus of the\n stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son\n begotten of Zeus, appear, my\n king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and\n sing you as Iacchus the Giver! \n \n ","64":"\n\n \n Enter Messenger, on the spectators' left. \n \n Messenger \n Neighbors of the house of Cadmus\n and of Amphion, there is no station of human life that I would ever\n praise or blame as being settled. Fortune sets upright and Fortune sinks\n the lucky and unlucky from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning the order\n that has just been established. For Creon, as I saw it, was once blest:\n he had saved this land of Cadmus from its enemies; and having won sole\n and total dominion in the land, he guided it on a straight course and\n flourished in his noble crop of children. And now all this has been lost. When a man has\n forfeited his pleasures, I do not reckon his existence as life, but\n consider him just a breathing corpse. Heap up riches in your house, if\n you wish! Live with a tyrant's pomp! But if there is no joy along with all of that, I would not pay\n even the shadow of smoke for all the rest, compared with joy. \n \n \n Chorus \n What is this new grief for our princes that you have come to report? \n \n \n Messenger \n They are dead, and the living are guilty of the deaths. \n \n \n Chorus \n Who is the murderer? Who the murdered? Tell us. \n \n \n Messenger \n Haemon is dead\u2014his blood was shed\n by no strange hand. \n \n \n Chorus \n Was it his father's, or his own ? \n \n \n Messenger \n He did it by his own, enraged with his father for the murder. \n \n \n Chorus \n Ah, prophet, how true, then, you have proved your word! \n \n \n Messenger \n Knowing that these things are so, you must consider the rest. \n \n \n Chorus \n Wait, I see the unhappy Eurydice,\n Creon's wife, nearby. She comes from the house either knowing of her\n son, or merely by chance. \n \n ","65":"\n Enter Eurydice. \n \n Eurydice \n People of Thebes , I heard your\n words as I was on my way to the gates to address divine Pallas with my\n prayers. At one and the same\n time I was loosening the bolts of the gate to open it, and the sound of\n a blow to our house struck my ear. In terror I sank back into the arms\n of my handmaids, and my senses fled. But repeat what your news was, for I shall hear it with\n ears that are no strangers to sorrow. \n \n \n Messenger \n Dear mistress, I will tell what I witnessed and leave no word of the\n truth unspoken. For what good would it do that should I soothe you with\n words in which I must later be found false? The truth is always best. I attended your husband as\n his guide to the furthest part of the plain, where unpitied the body of\n Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay. After we had prayed to the goddess\n of the roads and to Pluto to\n restrain their anger in mercy, we washed him with pure washing, and with\n freshly-plucked boughs we burned what remains there were. Lastly we\n heaped a high-mounded tomb of his native earth. Afterwards we turned\n away to enter the maiden's stoney-bedded bridal chamber, the caverned mansion of Hades' bride.\n From a distance, one of us servants heard a voice of loud wailing near\n that bride's unwept bed and came to tell our master Creon. And as the\n King moved closer and closer, obscure signs rising from a bitter cry\n surrounded him\u2014 he groaned and\n said in bitter lament, \u201cAh, misery, am I now the prophet of evil? Am I\n going on the path most lined with grief of all that I have walked\n before? My son's voice greets me. Go, my servants, hurry closer, and when you have reached the\n tomb, enter the opening where the stones of the mound have been torn\n away, up to the cell's very mouth. See if it is Haemon's voice that I\n recognize, or if I am cheated by the gods.\u201d \n \n ","66":"\n \n This search, at our desperate master's word, we went to make, and in the furthest part of the tomb\n we saw her hanging by the neck, fastened by a halter of fine linen\n threads, while he was embracing her with arms thrown around her waist,\n bewailing the loss of his bride to the spirits below, as well as his\n father's deeds, and his grief-filled marriage. But his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a\n dreadful cry and went in and called to him with a voice of wailing: \u201cAh,\n unhappy boy, what have you done! What plan have you seized on? By what\n misfortune have you lost your reason? Come out, my son, I pray you, I beg you!\u201d But the boy\n glared at him with savage eyes, spat in his face, and without a word in\n response drew his twin-edged sword. As his father rushed out in flight,\n he missed his aim. Then the ill-fated boy was enraged with\n himself and straightway\n stretched himself over his sword and drove it, half its length, into his\n side. Still conscious, he clasped the maiden in his faint embrace, and,\n as he gasped, he shot onto her pale cheek a swift stream of oozing\n blood. Corpse enfolding\n corpse he lay, having won his marriage rites, poor boy, not here, but in\n Hades' palace, and having shown to mankind by how much the failure to\n reason wisely is the most severe of all afflictions assigned to\n man. Eurydice departs into the house. \n \n \n ","67":"\n \n Chorus \n What would you infer from this? The lady has turned back and gone without a word, either for\n good or for evil. \n \n \n Messenger \n I, too, am startled. Still I am nourished by the hope that at the grave\n news of her son she thinks it unworthy to make her laments before the\n city, but in the shelter of her home will set her handmaids to mourn the\n house's grief. For she is not\n unhabituated to discretion, that she should err. \n \n \n Chorus \n I do not know. But to me, in any case, a silence too strict seems to\n promise trouble just as much as a fruitless abundance of weeping. \n \n \n Messenger \n I will find out whether she is not, in fact, hiding some repressed plan\n in the darkness of her passionate heart. I will go in, since you are right\u2014in an excess of\n silence, too, there may be trouble. Exit Messenger. \n \n ","68":"\n \n Enter Creon, attended and carrying the shrouded body of Haemon, on the\n spectators' left. \n \n Chorus \n Look, here is the King himself approaching, his hands grasping a monument\n plainly signing that his\u2014if we may say it\u2014and no one else's, was the madness of this error. \n \n ","69":"\n\n \n \n \n Creon \n Ah, the blunders of an unthinking\n mind, blunders of rigidity, yielding death! Oh, you witnesses of the\n killers and the killed, both of one family! What misery arises from my reasonings! Haemon, you have\n died after a young life, youngest and last of my sons! O God! You have\n departed not by your foolishness, but by my own! \n \n ","70":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Ah, how late you seem to see the\n right! \n \n \n Creon \n God, I have mastered the bitter lesson! But then, then, I think, some god\n struck me on my head with a crushing weight, and drove me into savage\n paths, \u2014ah!\u2014and overthrew my\n joy to be trampled on! Ah, the labors men must toil through! \n \n ","71":"\n \n Enter the Messenger from the house. \n \n \n Messenger \n My master, you have come, I\n think, like one whose hands are not empty, but who has a ready store:\n first, you carry that burden visible in your arms; second, you will soon look upon further\n sufferings inside your house. \n \n ","72":"\n \n \n Creon \n What worse suffering is still to follow upon these sufferings? \n \n \n Messenger \n Your wife is dead, true mother of that corpse, poor lady, by wounds newly\n cut. \n \n ","73":"\n \n \n Creon \n O harbor of Hades, hard to\n purify! Why, why do you ruin\n me? Herald of evil, of grief, what word do you say? Ah, you have done in\n a dead man anew! What are you saying, boy? What is this you report to\n me God no!\u2014what new\n slaughter, my wife's doom, is heaped upon this ruin? \n \n ","74":"\n \n The doors of the palace are opened, and the corpse of Eurydice is\n disclosed. \n \n \n Chorus \n The sight is at hand. It is no longer hidden inside. \n \n ","75":"\n \n \n Creon \n Ah, misery! There I see a new, a\n second evil! What destiny, ah, what, can still await me? I have just now\n taken my son in my arms, and now I see another corpse before\n me! Oh, tormented mother! Oh,\n my son! \n \n \n Messenger \n By the altar, with a\n sharp-whetted sword, she struck until her eyes went slack and dark.\n Before that she bewailed the noble fate of Megareus who died earlier,\n and then the fate of this boy, and also, with her last breath, she called down evil fortune upon you,\n the slayer of her sons. \n \n ","76":"\n \n \n Creon \n Ah, no! I tremble with fear. Why\n does no one strike me full on my chest with a two-edged sword? I am miserable\u2014ah\u2014and bathed in\n miserable anguish! \n \n \n Messenger \n Yes, because you were accused of responsibility for both this son's\n death, and the other's, by her whose corpse you see. \n \n \n Creon \n What was the manner of the violent deed by which she departed? \n \n \n Messenger \n Her own hand struck her to the\n heart upon learning her son's sharply-lamented fate. \n \n ","77":"\n \n \n Creon \n Ah this guilt can never be\n fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own! It was I, yes, I,\n who killed you, I the wretch. I\n admit the truth. Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all\n haste, who am no more than a dead man! \n \n \n Chorus \n The course you recommend is to\n your gain, if there can be gain amidst evil. What is briefest is best,\n when trouble lies at your feet. \n \n ","78":"\n \n \n Creon \n Let it come, let it appear, that\n fairest of fates for me, that brings my final day, the fate supreme! Oh, let it come, so that I\n may never see tomorrow's light! \n \n ","79":"\n \n Chorus \n These things are in the future.\n We must see to present affairs. Fulfillment of these things rests in the hands where it should\n rest. \n \n \n Creon \n All that I crave was summed in that prayer. \n \n \n Chorus \n Then pray no more; for mortals have no release from destined\n misfortune. \n \n ","80":"\n \n \n Creon \n Lead me away, I beg you, a rash,\n useless man. I have murdered you,\n son, unwittingly, and you, too, my wife\u2014the misery! I do not know which\n way I should look, or where I should seek support. All is amiss that is in my hands, and, again,\n a crushing fate has leapt upon my head. \n \n ","81":"\n\n \n \n As Creon is being conducted into the house, the Chorus Leader speaks the\n closing verses. \n \n Chorus \n Wisdom is provided as the chief\n part of happiness, and our dealings with the gods must be in no way\n unholy. The great words of arrogant men have to make repayment with\n great blows, and in old age teach wisdom. \n \n\n "},"commit":"af9982f35cd5f36f9bcbfe25aba3b3e677326ff5","author":"sophocles"}
