        "0":"\n Before the palace of Heracles at Thebes . Nearby stands the altar of Zeus, on the steps of which\n are now seated Amphitryon, Megara \n and her sons by Heracles. They are seeking refuge at the altar. \n \n Amphitryon \n What mortal has not heard of the one who shared a wife with Zeus, Amphitryon\n of Argos, whom once Alcaeus, son of Perseus, begot, Amphitryon the father of\n Heracles? Who lived here in Thebes , where from the sowing of the dragon's teeth grew up a crop of earth-born giants;\n and of these Ares saved a scanty band, and their children's children people\n the city of Cadmus. Hence sprung Creon, son of Menoeceus, king of this land;\n and Creon became the father of\n this lady Megara, whom once all Cadmus' race escorted with the glad music of\n lutes at her wedding, when the famous Heracles led her to my halls. \n Now he, my son, left Thebes where\n I was settled, left his wife Megara and her kin, eager to make his home in Argolis , in that walled town which the Cyclopes built, from\n which I am exiled for the slaying of Electryon; so he, wishing to lighten my\n affliction and to find a home in his own land, offered Eurystheus a mighty\n price for my recall: to free the\n world of savage monsters, whether it was that Hera goaded him to submit to\n this, or that fate was leagued against him. Other toils he has accomplished,\n and last of all has he passed through the mouth of Taenarus into the halls\n of Hades to drag to the light that\n hound with three bodies, and from there he has never returned. \n \n ",
        "1":"\n \n Now there is an ancient legend among the race of Cadmus that a certain Lycus\n in days gone by was husband to Dirce, and he was king of this city with its\n seven towers, before Amphion and Zethus, sons of Zeus, lords of the milk-white steeds, became rulers in\n the land. His son, called by the same name as his father, although no Theban\n but a stranger from Euboea , slew\n Creon, and after that seized the government, having fallen on this city when\n weakened by dissension. So this\n family connection with Creon is likely to prove to us a serious evil; for\n now that my son is in the bowels of the earth, this new monarch Lycus is\n bent on extirpating the children of Heracles, to quench one bloody feud with another, likewise his wife\n and me, if useless age like mine is to rank among men, that the boys may\n never grow up to exact a blood-penalty of their uncle's family. So I, left\n here by my son, while he is gone into the pitchy darkness of the earth,\n to tend and guard his children in\n his house, am taking my place with their mother, that the race of Heracles\n may not perish, here at the altar of Zeus the Savior, which my own gallant\n child set up to commemorate his\n glorious victory over the Minyae. And here we are careful to keep our\n station, though in need of everything, of food, drink and clothes, huddled\n together on the hard bare ground; for we are barred out from our house and\n sit here for want of any other safety. As for friends, some I see are unreliable; while others, who are staunch,\n have no power to help us further. This is what misfortune means to man; may\n it never fall to the lot of any who bears the least goodwill to me, to apply\n this never-failing test of friendship! \n \n ",
        "2":"\n \n Megara \n \n Old warrior, who once razed the\n citadel of the Taphians leading on the troops of Thebes to glory, how uncertain are the\n gods' dealings with man! For I, as far as concerned my father, was never an\n outcast of fortune, for he was once accounted a man of might by reason of\n his wealth, possessed as he was of\n royal power, for which long spears are launched at the lives of the\n fortunate through love of it; children too he had; and he gave me to your\n son, matching me in glorious marriage with Heracles. And now all that is\n dead and gone from us; and I and you,\n old friend, are doomed to die, and these children of Heracles, whom I am\n guarding beneath my wing as a bird keeps her tender chicks under her. And\n they one after another keep asking me: “Mother, tell us, where is our\n father gone from the land? what is he\n doing? when will he return?” Thus they inquire for their father, in\n childish perplexity; while I put them off with excuses, inventing stories;\n but still I wonder if it is he whenever a door creaks on its hinges, and up\n they all start, thinking to embrace their father's knees. What hope or way of salvation are you now devising,\n old friend? for I look to you. We can never steal beyond the boundaries of\n the land unseen, for there is too strict a watch set on us at every outlet,\n nor have we any longer hopes of safety in our friends. Whatever your scheme is, declare it, lest our death be\n made ready. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n It is by no means easy, my daughter, to give one's earnest advice on such\n matters easily, without weary thought; but let us prolong the time, since we\n are powerless to escape. \n \n \n Megara \n \n Do you need a further taste of grief,\n or do you cling so fast to life? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Yes, I love this life, and cling to its hopes. \n \n \n Megara \n So do I; but you should not expect the unexpected, old friend. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n In these delays the only cure for our evils is left. \n \n \n Megara \n It is the biting pain of that interval I feel so. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n \n Daughter, there may yet be a happy\n escape from present troubles for me and you; my son, your husband, may yet\n arrive. So calm yourself, and wipe those tears from your children's eyes,\n and soothe them with soft words, \n inventing a tale to delude then, piteous though such fraud be. Yes, for even\n men's misfortunes often flag, and the stormy wind does not always blow so\n strong, nor are the prosperous ever so; for all things change, making way\n for each other. The bravest man is\n he who relies ever on his hopes, but despair is the mark of a coward. \n \n ",
        "3":"\n\n \n \n The Chorus of Old Men of Thebes \n enters. \n \n Chorus \n To the sheltering roof, to the old man's couch, leaning on my staff have I\n set forth, chanting a plaintive\n dirge like some bird grown grey, I that am only a voice and a fancy bred of\n the visions of sleep by night, palsied with age, yet meaning kindly. All\n hail! you orphaned children! all\n hail, old friend! you too, unhappy mother, wailing for your husband in the\n halls of Hades! \n \n ",
        "4":"\n \n \n Chorus \n Do not faint too soon upon your way, \n or let your limbs grow weary, as a colt beneath the yoke grows weary as he\n mounts some stony hill, dragging the weight of a wheeled chariot. Take hold\n of hand or robe, who ever feels his footsteps falter. Old friend, escort another like yourself, who once\n amid his toiling peers in the days of our youth would take his place beside\n you, no blot upon his country's glorious record. \n \n ",
        "5":"\n \n \n Chorus \n \n See, how like their father's sternly\n flash these children's eyes! Misfortune has not failed his children, nor yet\n has his comeliness been denied them. \n O Hellas ! if you lose these, of\n what allies will you rob yourself! \n \n ",
        "6":"\n\n \n \n Chorus Leader \n But I see Lycus, the ruler of this land, drawing near the house. \n \n Lycus and his attendants enter. \n \n Lycus \n \n One question, if I may, to this\n father of Heracles and his wife; and certainly as your lord and master I\n have a right to put what questions I choose. How long do you seek to prolong\n your lives? What hope, what aid do you see to save you from death?\n Do you trust that these\n children's father, who lies dead in the halls of Hades, will return? How\n unworthily you show your sorrow at having to die, you after your idle\n boasts, scattered broadcast through Hellas , that Zeus was partner in your marriage-bed and was\n your partner in children; and you,\n after calling yourself the wife of so peerless a lord. \n After all, what was the fine exploit your husband achieved, if he did kill a\n hydra in a marsh or that monster of Nemea ? which he caught in a snare, for all he says he\n strangled it to death in his arms. \n Are these your weapons for the hard struggle? Is it for this then that\n Heracles' children should be spared? A man who has won a reputation for\n valor in his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; who never buckled shield to arm nor faced the\n spear, but with a bow, that coward's weapon, was ever ready to run away.\n Archery is no test of manly bravery; no! he is a man who keeps his post in\n the ranks and steadily faces the swift wound the spear may plough.\n My policy, again, old man, shows\n no reckless cruelty, but caution; for I am well aware I slew Creon, the\n father of this woman, and am in possession of his throne. So I have no wish\n that these children should grow up and be left to take vengeance on me in\n requital for what I have done. \n \n ",
        "7":"\n \n Amphitryon \n \n Let Zeus defend his his own share in\n his son; but as for me, Heracles, it is my concern on your behalf to prove\n by what I say this tyrant's ignorance; for I cannot allow you to be ill\n spoken of. First then for that which should never have been said—for\n to speak of you, Heracles, as a\n coward is, I think, outside the pale of speech—of that must I clear\n you with heaven to witness. I appeal then to the thunder of Zeus, and the\n chariot in which he rode, when he pierced the Giants, earth's brood, to the\n heart with his winged shafts, and\n with gods uplifted the glorious triumph song; or go to Pholoe and ask the\n insolent tribe of four-legged Centaurs, you craven king, ask them who they\n would judge the bravest of men; will they not say my son, who according to\n you is but a pretender? Were you to\n ask Euboean Dirphys, your native place, it would not sing your praise, for\n you have never done a single gallant deed to which your country can witness.\n Next you disparage that clever invention, an archer's weapon; come, listen to me and learn wisdom. A man\n who fights in line is a slave to his weapons, and if his fellow-comrades\n want for courage he is slain himself through the cowardice of his neighbors,\n or, if he breaks his spear, he cannot defend his body from death, having\n only one means of defence; whereas\n all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they have but one weapon, yet\n is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless arrows, still has\n others with which to defend himself from death, and standing at a distance\n keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness with invisible\n shafts, and never exposing himself\n to the foe, but keeping under cover; and this is by far the wisest course in\n battle, to harm the enemy and keep safe oneself, independent of chance.\n These arguments are completely opposite to yours with regard to the point at issue. Next, why are you\n desirous of slaying these children? What have they done to you? One piece of\n wisdom I credit you with, your coward terror of a brave man's descendants.\n Still it is hard on us, if for your\n cowardice we must die; a fate that ought to have overtaken you at our braver\n hands, if Zeus had been fairly disposed towards us. But, if you are so\n anxious to make yourself supreme in the land, let us go into exile;\n abstain from all violence, else\n you will suffer by it whenever the god causes fortune's breeze to veer\n round. \n \n ",
        "8":"\n \n Ah! you land of Cadmus—for to you too will I turn, distributing my\n words of reproach—is this your defense of Heracles and his children?\n the man who faced alone all the\n Minyans in battle and allowed Thebes to see the light with free eyes. I cannot praise\n Hellas , nor will I ever keep\n silence, finding her so craven as regards my son; she should have come with\n fire and sword and warrior's arms to\n help these tender chicks, to requite him for all his labors in purging land\n and sea. Such help, my children, neither Hellas nor the city of Thebes affords you; to me a feeble friend you look, and I\n am empty sound and nothing more. For\n the vigor which once I had, has gone from me; my limbs are palsied with age,\n and my strength is decayed. If I were young and still powerful in body, I\n would have seized my spear and dabbled those flaxen locks of his with blood,\n so that the coward would now be\n flying from my spear beyond the bounds of Atlas. \n \n \n Chorus Leader \n Have not the brave among mankind a fair occasion for speech, although slow to\n begin? \n \n \n Lycus \n Say what you will of me in your exalted phrase, but I by deeds will make you\n rue those words. \n Calling to his servants Go, some to Helicon, others to the\n glens of Parnassus , and bid woodmen\n to cut me logs of oak, and when they are brought to the town, pile up a\n stack of wood all round the altar on either side, and set fire to it and\n burn them all alive, that they may\n learn that the dead no longer rules this land, but that for the present I am\n king. angrily to the Chorus As for you, old men, since you\n thwart my views, not for the children of Heracles alone shall you lament,\n but likewise for your own \n misfortunes, and you shall never forget you are slaves and I your\n prince. \n \n ",
        "9":"\n \n Chorus \n —You sons of Earth, whom Ares once sowed, when from the dragon's\n ravening jaw he had torn the teeth, up with your staves, on which you lean\n your hands, and dash out this\n villain's brains! a fellow who, without even being a Theban, but a\n foreigner, lords it shamefully over the younger men; but my master shall you\n never be to your joy. \n —Nor shall you reap the harvest of all my toil; Go back to where you came from, in your insolence.\n For never while I live, shall you slay these sons of Heracles; not so deep\n beneath the earth has their father disappeared from his children's ken. \n —You are in possession of this land which you have ruined, while he, its benefactor, has missed his\n just reward. \n —And yet do I take too much upon myself because I help those I love\n after their death, when most they need a friend? \n —Ah! right hand, how you desire to wield the spear, but your weakness\n is a death-blow to your desire. For\n then I would have stopped you calling me slave, and I would have governed\n Thebes with credit. In which\n you now rejoice; for a city sick with dissension and evil counsels does not\n think aright; otherwise it would never have accepted you as its master. \n \n ",
        "10":"\n \n Megara \n \n Old men, I thank you; it is right\n that friends should feel virtuous indignation on behalf of those they love;\n but do not on our account vent your anger on the tyrant to your own undoing.\n Hear my advice, Amphitryon, if there appears to you to be anything in what I\n say. I love my children; strange if\n I did not love those whom I bore, whom I labored for! Death I count a\n dreadful fate; but the man who strives against necessity I esteem a fool.\n Since we must die, let us do so \n without being burnt alive, a source of mockery to our enemies, which to my\n mind is an evil worse than death; for much good do we owe our family. You\n have always had a warrior's fair fame, so it is not to be endured that you\n should die a coward's death; and my\n husband's reputation needs no one to witness that he would never consent to\n save these children's lives by letting them incur the stain of cowardice;\n for the noble are afflicted by disgrace on account of their children, nor\n must I shrink from following my lord's example. As to your hopes consider how I weigh them. Do you think\n your son will return from beneath the earth? And who ever has come back from\n the dead out of the halls of Hades? But would you soften this man by\n entreaty? Oh no! better to fly from one's enemy when he is so brutish,\n but yield to men of breeding and\n wisdom; for you would more easily conclude a friendly truce by accepting\n regard. True, a thought has already occurred to me that we might by entreaty\n obtain a sentence of exile for the children; yet this too is misery, to\n compass their deliverance with dire penury as the result; for it is a saying that hosts look sweetly on\n banished friends for a day and no more. Endure to die with us, for that\n awaits you after all. By your brave soul I challenge you, old friend; for\n whoever struggles hard to escape destiny sent by the gods shows zeal no doubt, but it is zeal with a taint\n of folly; for what must be, no one will ever avail to alter. \n \n \n Chorus Leader \n If a man had insulted you, while yet my arms were strong, there would have\n been an easy way to stop him; but now am I am nothing ; and so you\n henceforth, Amphitryon, must scheme\n how to avert misfortune. \n \n ",
        "11":"\n \n Amphitryon \n It is not cowardice or any longing for life that hinders my dying, but my\n wish to save my son's children, though no doubt I am longing for the\n impossible. See! here is my neck ready for the sword to pierce, to hack, to hurl from the rock; only\n one favor I crave for both of us, king; slay me and this hapless mother\n before you slay the children, that we may not see the hideous sight, as they\n gasp out their lives, calling on their mother and their father's father; for the rest work your will if\n so you are inclined; for we have no defense against death. \n \n \n Megara \n I too implore you add a second favor, that by your single act you may put us\n both under a double obligation; allow me to deck my children in the robes of\n death, first opening the palace\n gates, for now we are shut out, so that this at least they may obtain from\n their father's halls. \n \n \n Lycus \n I grant it, and bid my servants undo the bolts. Go in and deck yourselves;\n robes do not grudge. But as soon as you have clothed yourselves, I will return to you to consign you to the\n nether world. Lycus and his retinue withdraw. \n \n \n \n Megara \n Children, follow the footsteps of your hapless mother to your father's house,\n where others possess his substance, though his name is still\n ours. Megara and her children enter the palace. \n \n \n \n Amphitryon \n O Zeus, in vain, it seems, did I get you to share my bride with me;\n in vain used we to call you\n partner in my son. After all you are less our friend than you pretended.\n Great god as you are, I, a mortal, surpass you in true worth. For I did not\n betray the children of Heracles; but you by stealth found your way to my\n bed, taking another's wife without\n leave given, while to save your own friends you have no skill. Either you\n are a god of little sense, or else naturally unjust. Amphitryon\n follows Megara into the palace. \n \n \n ",

And now that is all vanished; fortune's breeze has veered\n and given to you for brides the maidens of death in their stead, and my\n tears will be the marriage bath; woe is me for my foolish thoughts! and your\n grandfather here is celebrating your marriage-feast, the cares of a father,\n accepting Hades as the father of your brides. Ah me! which of you shall I first press to my bosom, which\n last? on which bestow my kiss, or clasp close to me?

You aged friends, the joys of life are few; so take\n heed that you pass through it as gladly as you may, without a thought of sorrow from morning until\n night; for time takes little heed of preserving our hopes; and, when he has\n busied himself on his own business, away he flies.

For whom ought I to help\n rather than wife and children and\n aged father? Farewell my labors! for it was in vain I accomplished them\n rather than helping these.

Well, I must lead them, taking them by the hand\n to draw them after me, my little boats, like a ship when towing; for I too\n do not reject the care of my children; here all mankind are equal; all love\n their children, both those of high estate and those who are nothing; it is wealth that makes\n distinctions among them; some have, others want; but all the human race\n loves its offspring.

Oh! let me hide myself, concealed beneath the roof. \n \n \n Chorus \n Courage! darkness still holds your son's eye. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Oh beware! it is not that I shrink from leaving the light after my miseries,\n poor wretch! but if should he slay me, his father, then he will be devising woe on woe, and to the\n avenging curse will add a parent's blood. \n \n \n Chorus \n Well for you if you had died in that day, when, for your wife, you went forth\n to exact vengeance for her slain brothers by sacking the Taphians' sea-beat town. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Fly, fly, my aged friends, from before the palace, escape his waking fury.

I am alive and breathing; and my eyes see what they should, the sky and earth and the sun's darting\n beam; but how my senses reel! in what strange turmoil am I plunged! my\n fevered breath in quick spasmodic gasps escapes my lungs. How now? why am I\n lying here, my brawny chest and arms made fast with cables like a ship,\n beside a half-shattered piece\n of masonry, with corpses for my neighbors; while over the floor my bow and\n arrows are scattered, that once like trusty squires to my arm both kept me safe and were kept safe by\n me? Surely I have not come a second time to Hades' halls, having just\n returned from there for Eurystheus? To Hades? From where? No, I do not see\n Sisyphus with his stone, or Pluto, or his queen, Demeter's child. Surely I am distraught; where am I, so\n helpless? Ho, there! which of my friends is near or far to cure me in my\n ignorance? For I have no clear knowledge of things once familiar. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n My aged friends, shall I approach the scene of my sorrow? \n \n \n Chorus Leader \n \n Yes, and let me go with you, not\n desert you in your trouble. \n \n \n Heracles \n Father, why do you weep and veil your eyes, standing far from your beloved\n son? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n My child! mine still, for all your misery. \n \n \n Heracles \n Why, what is there so sad in my case that you weep? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n \n That which might make any of the\n gods weep, if he were to learn it. \n \n \n Heracles \n A bold assertion that, but you are not yet explaining what has happened. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Your own eyes see that, if by this time you are restored to your senses. \n \n \n Heracles \n Fill in your sketch if any change awaits my life. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n I will explain, if you are no longer mad as a fiend of hell. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n Oh! what suspicions these dark hints\n of yours again excite! \n \n \n Amphitryon \n I am still doubtful whether you are in your sober senses. \n \n \n Heracles \n I have no recollection of being mad. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Am I to loose my son, old friends, or what shall I do? \n \n \n Heracles \n Loose me, yes, and say who bound me; for I feel shame at this. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n \n Rest content with what you know of\n your woes; the rest forego. \n \n \n Heracles \n No. for is silence sufficient to learn what I wish? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n O Zeus, do you behold these deeds proceeding from the throne of Hera? \n \n \n Heracles \n What! have I suffered something from her enmity? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n A truce to the goddess! attend to your own troubles. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n I am undone; you will tell me some\n mischance. \n \n ",

Speak, father, you messenger of\n evil! \n \n \n Amphitryon \n You were insane; it is a sad explanation you are asking. \n \n \n Heracles \n Was it I that slew my wife also? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Your own unaided arm has done all this. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n Alas! a cloud of mourning wraps me\n round. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n For this reason I lament your fate. \n \n \n Heracles \n Did I dash my house to pieces in my frenzy? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n I know nothing but this, that you are utterly undone. \n \n \n Heracles \n Where did the madness seize me? where did it destroy me? \n \n \n Amphitryon \n \n When you were purifying yourself\n with fire at the altar. \n \n \n Heracles \n Ah me! why do I spare my own life when I have become the murderer of my dear\n children? Shall I not hasten to leap from some sheer rock, or aim the sword\n against my heart and avenge my\n children's blood, or burn my body, which she drove mad, in the fire and so\n avert from my life the infamy which now awaits me? \n But here I see Theseus coming to check my deadly counsels, my kinsman and\n friend. Now shall I stand revealed,\n and the dearest of my friends will see the pollution I have incurred by my\n children's murder. Ah, woe is me! what am I to do? Where can I find freedom\n from my sorrows? shall I take wings or plunge beneath the earth? Come, let\n me veil my head in darkness; for I\n am ashamed of the evil I have done, and, since for these I have incurred\n fresh blood-guiltiness, I do not want to harm the innocent. \n \n Theseus and his retinue enter. \n \n Theseus \n I have come, and others with me, young warriors from the land of Athens , encamped by the streams of\n Asopus, to bring an allied army to\n your son, old friend. For a rumour reached the city of the Erechtheidae,\n that Lycus had usurped the scepter of this land and had become your enemy\n even to battle. Wherefore I came making recompense for the former kindness\n of Heracles in saving me from the\n world below, if you have any need of such aid as I or my allies can give,\n old man. \n Ha! why this heap of dead upon the floor? Surely I have not delayed too long\n and come too late to check new ills? Who slew these children? whose wife is this I see? Boys do not go\n to battle; no, it must be some other strange mischance I here discover. \n \n ",

As a counterweight,\n fighting along with my tears, I entreat you as a suppliant, as I grasp your\n beard, your knees, your hands, and let fall the tear from my old eyes. O my child! restrain your\n savage lion-like temper, for you are rushing forth on an unholy course of\n bloodshed, eager to join woe to woe, child. \n \n ",
        "54":"\n \n Theseus \n Enough! To you I call who are huddled there in your misery, show to your friends your face; for no darkness\n is black enough to hide your sad mischance. Why do you wave your hand at me,\n signifying murder? is it that I may not be polluted by speaking with you?\n If I share your misfortune,\n what is that to me? For once I had good fortune with you. I must refer to\n the time when you brought me safe from the dead to the light of life. I hate\n a friend whose gratitude grows old; one who is ready to enjoy his friends'\n prosperity but unwilling to sail in\n the same ship with them when they are unfortunate. Arise, unveil your head,\n poor wretch! and look on me. The gallant soul endures such blows as heaven\n deals and does not refuse them. \n \n \n Heracles \n O Theseus, did you see this struggle with my children? \n \n \n Theseus \n \n I heard of it, and now I see the\n horrors you mean. \n \n \n Heracles \n Why then have you unveiled my head to the sun? \n \n \n Theseus \n Why have I? you, a mortal, can not pollute what is of the gods. \n \n \n Heracles \n Try to escape, luckless wretch, from my unholy taint. \n \n \n Theseus \n The avenging fiend does not go forth from friend to friend. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n For this I thank you; I do not\n regret the service I did you. \n \n \n Theseus \n While I, for kindness then received, now show my pity for you. \n \n \n Heracles \n Ah yes! I am piteous, a murderer of my sons. \n \n \n Theseus \n I weep for you in your changed fortunes. \n \n \n Heracles \n Did you ever find another more afflicted? \n \n \n Theseus \n \n Your misfortunes reach from earth to\n heaven. \n \n \n Heracles \n Therefore I am resolved on death. \n \n \n Theseus \n Do you suppose the gods attend to your threats? \n \n \n Heracles \n The god has been remorseless to me; so I will be the same to the gods. \n \n \n Theseus \n Hush! lest your presumption add to your sufferings. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n My ship is freighted full with\n sorrow; there is no room to stow anything further. \n \n \n Theseus \n What will you do? Where is your fury drifting you? \n \n \n Heracles \n I will die and return to that world below from which I have just come. \n \n \n Theseus \n Such language is fit for any common fellow. \n \n \n Heracles \n Ah! yours is the advice of one outside sorrow. \n \n \n Theseus \n \n Are these indeed the words of\n Heracles, the much-enduring? \n \n \n Heracles \n Though never so much as this. Endurance must have a limit. \n \n \n Theseus \n Is this the benefactor and great friend to mortals? \n \n \n Heracles \n Mortals bring no help to me; no! Hera has her way. \n \n \n Theseus \n Never would Hellas allow you to die\n through sheer perversity. \n \n ",
        "55":"\n \n Heracles \n \n Hear me a moment, that I may enter\n the contest with words in answer to your admonitions; and I will unfold to\n you why life now as well as formerly has been unbearable to me. First I am\n the son of a man who incurred the guilt of blood, before he married my\n mother Alcmena, by slaying her aged\n father. Now when the foundation is badly laid at birth, it is necessary for\n the race to be cursed with woe; and Zeus, whoever this Zeus may be, begot me\n as an enemy to Hera; yet do not be vexed, old man; for you rather than Zeus I regard as my father.\n Then while I was being suckled, that bedfellow of Zeus foisted into my\n cradle fearsome snakes to cause my death. After I took on a cloak of\n youthful flesh, of all the toils I\n then endured what need to tell? what did I not destroy, whether lions, or\n triple-bodied Typhons, or giants or the battle against the hosts of\n four-legged Centaurs? or how when I had killed the hydra, that monster with a ring of heads with power to\n grow again, I passed through a herd of countless other toils besides and\n came to the dead to fetch to the light at the bidding of Eurystheus the\n three-headed hound, hell's porter. Last, ah, woe is me! I have dared this\n labor, to crown the sorrows of my\n house with my children's murder. I have come to this point of necessity; no\n longer may I dwell in Thebes ,\n the city that I love; for suppose I stay, to what temple or gathering of\n friends shall I go? For mine is no curse that invites greetings. Shall I go to Argos ? how can I, when I am an exile\n from my country? Well, is there a single other city I can rush to? Am I then\n to be looked at askance as a marked man, held by cruel stabbing tongues:\n “Is not this the son of Zeus that once murdered children and wife? Plague take him from the\n land!” Now to one who was once called happy, such changes are a\n grievous thing; though he who is always unfortunate feels no such pain, for\n sorrow is his birthright. \n \n ",
        "56":"\n \n This, I think, is the piteous pass I shall one day come to; for earth will cry out forbidding me to touch\n her, the sea and the river-springs will refuse me a crossing, and I shall\n become like Ixion who revolves in chains upon that wheel. And so this is\n best, that I should be seen by no one of the Hellenes, among whom in happier days I lived in bliss. What\n right have I to live? what profit can I have in the possession of a useless,\n impious life? So let that noble wife of Zeus dance, beating her foot in its\n shoe; for now has she worked her\n heart's desire in utterly confounding the first of Hellas ' sons. Who would pray to such a\n goddess? Her jealousy of Zeus for his love of a woman has destroyed\n the benefactors of Hellas , guiltless though they were. \n \n \n Chorus Leader \n This is the work of none other of the gods than the wife of Zeus; you are\n right in that surmise. \n \n \n Theseus \n I cannot counsel you . . . rather than to go on suffering. There is not a man\n alive that has wholly escaped misfortune's taint, nor any god either, if what poets sing is true. Have they\n not intermarried in ways that law forbids? Have they not thrown fathers into\n ignominious chains to gain the sovereign power? Still they inhabit\n Olympus and brave the issue of\n their crimes. And yet what shall\n you say in your defence, if you, a child of man, take your fate excessively\n hard, while they, as gods, do not? No, then, leave Thebes in compliance with the law, and\n come with me to the city of Pallas. There, when I have purified you of your\n pollution, I will give you homes\n and the half of all I have. Yes, I will give you all those presents I\n received from the citizens for saving their fourteen children, when I slew\n the bull of Crete ; for I have plots\n of land assigned me throughout the country; these shall henceforth\n be called after you by men,\n while you live; and at your death, when you have gone to Hades' halls, the\n whole city of Athens shall exalt\n your honor with sacrifices and a monument of stone. For it is a noble crown\n of a good reputation for citizens\n to win from Hellas , by helping a\n man of worth. This is the return that I will make you for saving me, for now\n you are in need of friends. But when the gods honor a man, he has no need of\n friends; for the god's aid, when he chooses to give it, is enough. \n \n ",
        "57":"\n \n Heracles \n \n Alas! this is quite beside the\n question of my troubles. For my part, I do not believe that the gods indulge\n in unholy unions; and as for putting bonds on hands, I have never thought\n that worthy of belief, nor will I now be so persuaded, nor again that one\n god is naturally lord and master of another. For the deity, if he be really such, has no wants; these\n are miserable tales of the poets. But I, for all my piteous plight,\n reflected whether I should let myself be branded as a coward for giving up\n my life. For whoever does not withstand disasters will never be able to withstand even a man's weapon. I\n will be steadfast in living; I will go to your city, with grateful thanks\n for all you offer me. He weeps. But I have tasted of\n countless troubles, as is well known; never yet did I faint at any or shed a\n single tear; no, nor did I ever think that I should come to this, to let the tear-drop fall. But now, it seems,\n I must be fortune's slave. \n Well, let it pass; my old father, you see me go forth to exile, and in me you\n see my own children's murderer. \n Give them burial, and lay them out in death with the tribute of a tear, for\n the law forbids my doing so. Rest their heads upon their mother's bosom and\n fold them in her arms, sad fellowship, which I, alas! unwittingly did slay.\n And when you have buried these dead, live on here still, in bitterness maybe, but still constrain your soul to\n share my sorrows. O children! he who begot you, your own father, has been\n your destroyer, and you have had no profit of my triumphs, all my restless\n toil to win for you by force a fair\n name, a glorious advantage from a father. You too, unhappy wife, this hand\n has slain, a poor return to make you for preserving the honor of my bed so\n safely, for all the weary watch you long have kept within my house. Alas for\n you, my wife, my sons! alas for me, \n how sad my lot, cut off from wife and child! Ah! these kisses, bitter-sweet!\n these weapons which it is pain to own! I am not sure whether to keep or let\n them go; dangling at my side they thus will say, “With us you destroyed children and wife; we are\n your children's slayers, and you keep us.” Shall I carry them after\n that? what answer can I make? Yet, am I to strip myself of these weapons,\n the comrades of my glorious career in Hellas , and put myself in the power of my foes, to die a\n death of shame? No! I must not let\n them go, but keep them, though it grieves me. In one thing, Theseus, help my\n misery; come to Argos and help me\n to manage the conveyance of the wretched dog; lest, if I go all alone, my\n sorrow for my sons may do me some hurt. \n \n ",

Ah! aged father, this is\n the kind of man to make a friend. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n \n Blessed in her sons, the country\n that gave him birth! \n \n \n Heracles \n Theseus, turn me back again to see my children. \n \n \n Theseus \n What for? Do you think to find a drug in this to soothe your soul? \n \n \n Heracles \n I long to do so, and would embrace my father. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Here am I, my son; your wish is no less dear to me. \n \n \n Theseus \n \n Have you so short a memory for your\n troubles? \n \n \n Heracles \n All that I endured before was easier to bear than this. \n \n \n Theseus \n If anyone sees you play the woman, they will scoff. \n \n \n Heracles \n Have I by living grown so abject in your sight? It was not so once, I\n think. \n \n \n Theseus \n Yes, too much so; in your sickness you are not the glorious Heracles. \n \n \n Heracles \n \n What about you? What kind of hero\n were you when in trouble in the world below? \n \n \n Theseus \n I was worse than anyone as far as courage went. \n \n \n Heracles \n How then can you say of me, that I am abased by my troubles? \n \n \n Theseus \n Forward! \n \n \n Heracles \n Farewell, my aged father! \n \n \n Amphitryon \n Farewell to you, my son! \n \n \n Heracles \n Bury my children as I said. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n But who will bury me, my son? \n \n \n Heracles \n \n I will. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n When wil you come? \n \n \n Heracles \n After you have buried my children. \n \n \n Amphitryon \n How? \n \n \n Heracles \n I will fetch you from Thebes to\n Athens .
