The rich-haired Nymphs received him in their bosoms from the lord his father and fostered and nurtured him carefully ","1":"in the dells of Nysa , where by the will of his father he grew up in a sweet-smelling cave, being reckoned among the immortals. But when the goddesses had brought him up, a god oft hymned, then began he to wander continually through the woody coombes, thickly wreathed with ivy and laurel. And the Nymphs followed in his train ","2":"with him for their leader; and the boundless forest was filled with their outcry. And so hail to you, Dionysus, god of abundant clusters! Grant that we may come again rejoicing to this season, and from that season onwards for many a year."},"commit":"af9982f35cd5f36f9bcbfe25aba3b3e677326ff5","author":"homeric hymns"}
