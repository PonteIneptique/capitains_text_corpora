But for me it would take a long\n time to tell the story of all their excellence. For I came, Muse, a steward\n of victory-songs to Phylacidas and Pytheas and Euthymenes. The story will be\n told in the Argive manner, very briefly. \n ","16":" For those splendid boys and their uncle won three victories in the\n pancratium\u2014at the Isthmus, and others at Nemea with its fine trees, and they\n brought to light a great share of praises.
