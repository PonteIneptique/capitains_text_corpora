She gave it as a birthday gift to Phoebus, who has his name from Phoebe. Leaving the lake and ridge of Delos , he landed on Pallas' ship-frequented shores,","1":"and came to this region and the dwelling places on Parnassus . The children of Hephaistos, road-builders taming the wildness of the untamed land, escorted him with mighty reverence. And at his arrival, the people","2":"and Delphus, helmsman and lord of this land, made a great celebration for him. Zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne; but Loxias is the spokesman of Zeus, his father.\n These are the gods I place in the beginning of my prayer.","3":"And Pallas who stands before the temple is honored in my words; and I worship the Nymphs where the Corycian rock is hollow, the delight of birds and haunt of gods. Bromius has held the region \u2014I do not forget him\u2014 ever since he, as a god, led the Bacchantes in war,","4":"and contrived for Pentheus death as of a hunted hare. I call on the streams of Pleistus and the strength of Poseidon, and highest Zeus, the Fulfiller; and then I take my seat as prophetess upon my throne. And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances.","5":"And if there are any from among the Hellenes here, let them enter, in turn, by lot, as is the custom. For I prophesy as the god leads. She enters the temple and after a brief interval returns terror-stricken \n \n ","6":"so that I have no strength and I cannot walk upright. I am running on hands and knees, with no quickness in my limbs; for an old woman, overcome with fright, is nothing, or rather she is like a child.\n I was on my way to the inner shrine, decked with wreaths; I saw on the center-stone a man defiled in the eyes of the gods,","7":"occupying the seat of suppliants. His hands were dripping blood; he held a sword just drawn and an olive-branch, from the top of the tree, decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool, a shining fleece; for as to this I can speak clearly.","8":"\n \n Before this man an extraordinary band of women slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting, \n ","9":"carrying off the feast of Phineus; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men.","10":"I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards.\n Let what is to come now be the concern of the master of this house,","11":"powerful Loxias himself. He is a prophet of healing, a reader of portents, and for others a purifier of homes. Exit \n \n ","12":"I will not be gentle to your enemies. So now you see these mad women overcome; these loathsome maidens have fallen asleep, old women, ancient children, with whom no god or man or beast ever mingles.","13":"They were even born for evil, since they live in evil gloom and in Tartarus under the earth, creatures hateful to men and to the Olympian gods. Nevertheless, escape and do not be cowardly.","14":"For as you go always over the earth that wanderers tread, they will drive you on, even across the wide mainland, beyond the sea and the island cities. Do not grow weary too soon, brooding on this labor, but when you have come to Pallas' city, sit down and hold in your arms her ancient image.","15":"And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors. For I persuaded you to take your mother's life.\n ","16":"and, since you know this, learn not to be neglectful also. For your power to do good is assured.\n ","17":"be his guide, shepherding this suppliant of mine\u2014truly Zeus respects this right of outlaws\u2014as he is sped on towards mortals with the fortune of a good escort. Exit. Orestes departs escorted by Hermes. The Ghost of Clytaemestra appears. \n \n ","18":"because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace. I tell you that I am most greatly accused by them. And yet, although I have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin,","19":"no divine power is angry on my behalf, slaughtered as I have been by the hands of a matricide. See these gashes in my heart, and from where they came! For the sleeping mind has clear vision, but in the daytime the fate of mortals is unforeseeable.","20":"\n \n Truly, you have lapped up many of my offerings\u2014wineless libations, a sober appeasement; and I have sacrificed banquets in the solemn night upon a hearth of fire at an hour unshared by any god. I see all this trampled under foot.","21":"But he has escaped and is gone, like a fawn; lightly indeed, from the middle of snares, he has rushed away mocking at you. Hear me, since I plead for my life, awake to consciousness, goddesses of the underworld!","22":"For in a dream I, Clytaemestra, now invoke you.\n ","23":"\n The Chorus continues to whine. \n \n ","24":"\n \n ","26":"for reproach becomes a spur to the right-minded. Send after him a gust of bloody breath, shrivel him with the vapor, the fire from your guts, follow him, wither him with fresh pursuit! The Ghost of Clytaemestra disappears; the Furies, roused by their leader, awake one after the other. \n \n ","27":"Still asleep? Get up, shake off sleep, let us see if any part of this beginning is in vain.\n ","28":"oh! an unbearable evil. The beast has escaped from our nets and is gone. Overcome by sleep, I have lost my prey.\n ","29":"by showing respect to your suppliant, a godless man and cruel to a parent; although you are a god, you have stolen away a man that killed his mother. What is there here that anyone shall call just?\n ","30":"struck me like a charioteer with goad held tight, under my heart, under my vitals. I can feel the cruel, the very cruel chill of the executioner's destroying scourge.","32":"I can see the center-stone of the earth defiled with a terrible pollution of blood.\n ","33":"against the law of the gods, he has honored mortal things and caused the ancient allotments to decay.\n ","34":"A suppliant, he will acquire another avenger from his family. \n \n ","35":"so that you may not be struck by a winged glistening snake shot forth from a golden bow-string, and painfully release black foam, vomiting the clots of blood you have drained from mortals.","36":"It is not right for you to approach this house; no, your place is where the punishments are beheading, gouging out of eyes, cutting of throats, and where young men's virility is ruined by destruction of seed; where there is mutilation and stoning, and where those who are impaled beneath their spine moan long and piteously.","37":"Do you hear what sort of feast is your delight? You are detested by the gods for it. The whole fashion of your form sets it forth. Creatures like you should live in the den of a blood-drinking lion, and not inflict pollution on all near you in this oracular shrine.","38":"Be gone, you goats without a herdsman! No god loves such a flock.\n ","42":"and from her come the dearest things for mortals. For marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by Justice. If, then, one should kill the other and you are so lenient as not to punish or visit them with anger,","43":"I claim that you unjustly banish Orestes from his home. For I see you taking the one cause very much to heart, but clearly acting more leniently about the other. But the goddess Pallas will oversee the pleadings in this case.\n ","45":"I will pursue my case against this man and I will hunt him down. Exeunt. \n \n ","46":"Receive kindly an accursed wretch, not one who seeks purification, or with unclean hand, but with my guilt's edge already blunted and worn away at other homes and in the travelled paths of men. Going over land and sea alike,","47":"keeping the commands of Loxias' oracle, I now approach your house and image, goddess. Here I will keep watch and await the result of my trial.\n ","48":"Follow the hints of a voiceless informer. For as a hound tracks a wounded fawn, so we track him by the drops of blood. My lungs pant from many tiring struggles, for I have roamed over the whole earth, and I have come over the sea in wingless flight,","49":"pursuing him, no slower than a ship. And now he is here somewhere, cowering. The smell of human blood gives me a smiling welcome.\n\n ","50":"\n \n Yes, here he is again with a defense; his arms twisted around the image of the immortal goddess, he wishes to be tried for his debt. \n ","51":"\n \n But that is not possible; a mother's blood upon the earth is hard to recover\u2014alas, the liquid poured on the ground is gone.\n But you must allow me in return to suck the red blood from your living limbs.","52":"May I feed on you\u2014a gruesome drink!\n I will wither you alive and drag you down, so that you pay atonement for your murdered mother's agony.\n And you will see any other mortal who has sinned by not honoring a god or a stranger","53":"or dear parents, each having a just punishment.\n For Hades is mighty in holding mortals to account under the earth, and he observes all things and within his mind inscribes them.","55":"the pollution of matricide is washed away; while it was still fresh, it was driven away at the hearth of the god Phoebus by purifying sacrifices of swine. It would be a long story to tell from the beginning, how many people I have visited, with no harm from association with me.","56":"[Time purges all things, aging with them.]\n So now with a pure mouth I piously invoke Athena, lady of this land, to come to my aid. Without the spear, she will win me and my land and the Argive people","57":"as faithful and true allies for all time. But whether in some region of the Libyan land, near the waters of Triton, her native stream, she is in action or at rest, aiding those whom she loves, or whether, like a bold marshal, she is surveying the Phlegraean plain,","58":"oh, let her come\u2014as a goddess, she hears even from far away\u2014to be my deliverer from distress!\n\n ","59":"not knowing where joy is in your heart\u2014a bloodless victim of the gods below, a shadow.\n You do not answer, but scorn my words, you who are fattened and consecrated to me? Living, you will be my feast, not slain\nat an altar;","60":"now you will hear this hymn, a spell to bind you.\n ","61":"We claim to be just and upright. No wrath from us will come stealthily to the one who holds out clean hands, and he will go through life unharmed;","62":"but whoever sins, as this man has, and hides his blood-stained hands, as avengers of bloodshed we appear against him to the end, presenting ourselves as upright witnesses for the dead.","64":"a proper expiation for his mother's blood.\n ","65":"the Furies' hymn, a spell to bind the soul, not tuned to the lyre, withering the life of mortals.\n ","66":" when rash murders of kin come upon mortals, we pursue them until they go under the earth; and after death, they have no great freedom.","69":"and I have neither lot nor portion of pure white ceremonial robes < >\n ","70":"So speeding after this man, we weaken him, even though he is strong, because of the fresh blood.\n ","71":"and to establish for the gods exemption from my concerns, so that it will not come to trial; for Zeus has considered us, a blood-dripping, hateful band, unworthy of his council.","73":"and the vindictive dance of our feet.\n ","74":"\u2014unendurable ruin.\n ","76":"separated from the gods in sunless light\u2014our office that makes the path rough for seeing and dim-sighted alike.\n ","77":"when he hears from me the law ordained by Fate, given by the gods for perfect fulfilment? My ancient privilege still remains, I do not meet with dishonor,","78":" although I have my place under the earth and in sunless darkness.\n ","79":"to be wholly mine forever, a choice gift to Theseus' sons. From there I have come, urging on my tireless foot, without wings rustling the folds of my aegis, [yoking this chariot to colts in their prime.]\n \n ","80":"As I see this strange company of visitors to my land, I am not afraid, but it is a wonder to my eyes. Who in the world are you? I address you all in common\u2014this stranger sitting at my image, and you, who are like no race of creatures ever born,","81":"neither seen by gods among goddesses nor resembling mortal forms. But it is far from just to speak ill of one's neighbor who is blameless, and Right stands aloof.\n ","82":"We are the eternal children of Night. We are called Curses in our homes beneath the earth.\n ","87":"as a sacred suppliant, like Ixion. To all this give me a plain answer.\n ","88":"I will give you strong proof of this. It is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a new-born victim by a man who can purify from murder.","89":"Long before at other houses I have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams.\n And so I declare that this concern is out of the way. As to my family, you will soon learn. I am an Argive ; my father\u2014you rightly inquire about him","90":"\u2014was Agamemnon, the commander of the naval forces; along with him, you made Troy , the city of Ilion , to be no city. He did not die nobly, after he came home; but my black-hearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath.","91":"And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me Loxias is responsible for this deed,","92":"because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content.\n ","93":"no, it is not lawful even for me to decide on cases of murder that is followed by the quick anger of the Furies, especially since you, by rites fully performed, have come a pure and harmless suppliant to my house; and so I respect you, since you do not bring harm to my city.","94":"Yet these women have an office that does not permit them to be dismissed lightly; and if they fail to win their cause, the venom from their resentment will fall upon the ground, an intolerable, perpetual plague afterwards in the land.\n So stands the case:","95":"either course\u2014to let them stay, to drive them out\u2014brings disaster and perplexity to me. But since this matter has fallen here, I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time. Summon your witnesses and proofs, ","96":"sworn evidence to support your case; and I will return when I have chosen the best of my citizens, for them to decide this matter truly, after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice. Exit \n \n ","97":"if the wrongful cause of this matricide is to triumph. Now his deed will accustom all men to recklessness;","98":"many sorrowful wounds, given in truth by children, wait for parents in the future time.\n ","99":"\u2014I will let loose death in every form. And as he anticipates his neighbor's evils, one man will ask of another when hardship is to end or to decrease;","100":"and the poor wretch offers the vain consolation of uncertain remedies.\n ","101":"\u201cJustice!\u201d \u201cThrones of the Furies!\u201d Perhaps some father, or mother, in new sorrow, may cry out these words piteously, now that the house of Justice is falling.","103":"But who, if he did not train his heart in fear, either city or mortal, would still revere justice in the same way?","105":"I have a timely word of advice: arrogance is truly the child of impiety, but from health of soul","106":"comes happiness, dear to all, much prayed for.\n ","107":"for punishment will come upon you. The appointed fulfilment remains. Therefore, let a man rightly put first in honor the reverence owed to his parents,","108":"and have regard for attentions paid to guests welcomed in his house.\n ","109":"will not lack happiness; he will never be utterly destroyed. But I say that the man who boldly transgresses, amassing a great heap unjustly\u2014by force, in time, he will strike his sail,","110":"when trouble seizes him as the yardarm is splintered.\n ","111":"seeing him, who boasted that this would never happen, exhausted by distress without remedy and unable to surmount the cresting wave. He wrecks the happiness of his earlier life on the reef of Justice, and he perishes unwept, unseen.","113":"it is good to be silent, and for my ordinances to be learned, by the whole city for everlasting time, and by these appellants, so that their case may be decided well.\n ","115":"\n To Athena. Bring in the case, and, in accordance with your wisdom, decide it.\n ","116":"\n To Orestes. Answer our questions, one by one. Say first if you killed your mother.\n ","121":"For I do not deny that I did it, as it is done. But decide whether this bloodshed was, to your mind, just or not, so that I may inform the court.\n ","122":"I have never yet, on my oracular throne, said anything about a man or woman or city that Zeus, the father of the Olympians, did not command me to say.\n Learn how strong this plea of justice is; and I tell you to obey the will of my father;","123":"for an oath is not more powerful than Zeus. \n \n ","124":"honored by a god-given scepter, and his murder indeed by a woman, not by rushing arrows sped from afar, as if by an Amazon, but as you will hear, Pallas, and those who are sitting to decide by vote in this matter.","125":"\n \n She received him from the expedition, where he had for the most part won success beyond expectation, in the judgment of those favorable to him; then, as he was stepping from the bath, on its very edge, she threw a cloak like a tent over it, fettered her husband in an embroidered robe, and cut him down.","126":"\n \n This was his death, as I have told it to you\u2014the death of a man wholly majestic, commander of the fleet. As for that woman, I have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case.\n ","127":"yet he himself bound his aged father, Cronus. How does this not contradict what you say? I call on you as witnesses turning to the judges to hear these things.\n ","128":"and many means of release. But when the dust has drawn up the blood of a man, once he is dead, there is no return to life. For this, my father has made no magic spells, although he arranges all other things, turning them up and down;","129":"nor does his exercise of force cost him a breath.\n ","130":"What purification rite of the brotherhoods will receive him?\n ","131":"preserves the young plant, if the god does not harm it. And I will show you proof of what I say: a father might exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb,","132":"and she is such a child as no goddess could give birth to.\n For my part, Pallas, as in all other matters, as I know how, I will make your city and people great; and I have sent this man as a suppliant to your sanctuary so that he may be faithful for all time,","133":"and that you, goddess, might win him and those to come after him as a new ally and so that these pledges of faith might remain always, for the later generations of these people to cherish.\n ","136":"when they came with an army in resentment against Theseus, and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his, and sacrificed to Ares, from which this rock takes its name, the Hill of Ares: \n ","137":"on this hill, the reverence of the citizens, and fear, its kinsman, will hold them back from doing wrong by day and night alike, so long as they themselves do not pollute the laws with evil streams; if you stain clear water with filth, you will never find a drink.","138":"\n \n Neither anarchy nor tyranny\u2014this I counsel my citizens to support and respect, and not to drive fear wholly out of the city. For who among mortals, if he fears nothing, is righteous? Stand in just awe of such majesty,","139":"and you will have a defense for your land and salvation of your city, such as no man has, either among the Scythians or in Pelops' realm. I establish this tribunal, untouched by greed, worthy of reverence, quick to anger, awake on behalf of those who sleep, a guardian of the land.","140":"\n \n I have prolonged this advice to my citizens for the future; but now you must rise and take a ballot, and decide the case under the sacred obligation of your oath. My word has been spoken.","141":"\n The judges rise from their seats and cast their ballots one by one during the following altercation. \n \n ","142":"You will prophesy, dispensing prophecies that are no longer pure.\n ","144":"especially when he is in need?\n ","145":"\n The balloting is now ended. \n \n ","146":"For there was no mother who gave me birth; and in all things, except for marriage, whole-heartedly I am for the male and entirely on the father's side. Therefore, I will not award greater honor to the death of a woman who killed her husband, the master of the house.","147":"Orestes wins, even if the vote comes out equal.\n Cast the ballots out of the urns, as quickly as possible, you jurors who have been assigned this task. The ballots are turned out and separated. \n \n ","149":"and the cast of a single ballot has set upright a house. The ballots are shown to Athena. \n \n ","150":"The Hellenes will say, \u201cThe man is an Argive once again, and lives in his father's heritage, by the grace of Pallas and of Loxias and of that third god, the one who accomplishes everything, the savior\u201d\u2014the one who, having respect for my father's death,","151":"saves me, seeing those advocates of my mother.\n I will return to my home now, after I swear an oath to this land and to your people for the future and for all time to come, that no captain of my land","152":"will ever come here and bring a well-equipped spear against them. For I myself, then in my grave, will accomplish it by failure without remedy, making their marches spiritless and their journeys \nill-omened,","153":"so that those who violate my present oath will repent their enterprise. But while the straight course is preserved, and they hold in everlasting honor this city of Pallas with their allied spears, I will be the more well-disposed to them.\n And so farewell\u2014you and the people who guard your city.","154":"May your struggle with your enemies let none escape, bringing you safety and victory with the spear! Exit. \n \n ","155":"on this land, alas, I will release venom from my heart, venom in return for my grief, drops that the land cannot endure. From it, a blight that destroys leaves, destroys children\u2014a just return\u2014","156":"speeding over the plain, will cast infection on the land to ruin mortals. I groan aloud. What shall I do? I am mocked by the people. What I have suffered is unbearable.","157":"Ah, cruel indeed are the wrongs of the daughters of Night, mourning over dishonor!\n ","158":"but clear testimony from Zeus was present, and he himself who spoke the oracle himself gave witness that Orestes should not suffer harm for his deed. Do not be angry, do not hurl your heavy rage on this land,","159":"or cause barrenness, letting loose drops whose savage spirit will devour the seed. For I promise you most sacredly that you will have a cavernous sanctuary in a righteous land,","160":"where you will sit on shining thrones at your hearths, worshipped with honor by my citizens here.\n ","161":"on this land, alas, I will release venom from my heart, venom in return for my grief, drops that the land cannot endure. From it a blight that destroys leaves, destroys children\u2014a just return\u2014","164":"I also rely on Zeus\u2014what need is there to mention that?\u2014and I alone of the gods know the keys to the house where his thunderbolt is sealed. But there is no need of that. So yield to my persuasion and do not hurl the words of a reckless tongue against the land,","165":"that all things bearing fruit will not prosper. Calm the black wave's bitter anger, since you will receive proud honors and will live with me. And when you have the first-fruits of this great land forever, offerings on behalf of children and of marriage rites,","166":"you will praise my counsel.\n ","167":"Oh, oh, the shame of it! What anguish steals into my breast! Hear my anger, mother Night; for the deceptions of the gods, hard to fight, have deprived me of my ancient honors, bringing me to nothing.","169":"But as for you, if you go to a foreign land, you will come to love this land\u2014I forewarn you. For time, flowing on, will bring greater honor to these citizens. And you, having a seat of honor at the house of Erechtheus,","170":"will obtain from hosts of men and women more than you could ever win from other mortals. So do not cast on my realm keen incentives to bloodshed, harmful to young hearts, maddening them with a fury not of wine;","171":"and do not, as if taking the heart out of fighting cocks, plant in my people the spirit of tribal war and boldness against each other. Let their war be with foreign enemies, and without stint for one in whom there will be a terrible passion for glory;","172":"but I say there will be no battling of birds within the home. It is possible for you to choose such things from me: bestowing good, receiving good, well honored in this land that is most beloved to the gods.\n ","173":"Hear my anger, mother Night; for the deceptions of the gods, hard to fight, have deprived me of my ancient honors, bringing me to nothing.","175":"the sweetness and charm of my tongue, then you might remain.
