And when they had fully decked her, ","3":"they brought her to the gods, who welcomed her when they saw her, \n giving her their hands. Each one of them prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, \n so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea.\n Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess! \n Grant that I may gain the victory in this contest, ","4":"and order you my song. And now I will remember you and another song also."},"commit":"af9982f35cd5f36f9bcbfe25aba3b3e677326ff5","author":"homeric hymns"}
