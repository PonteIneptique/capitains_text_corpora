        "2":"and adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts, jewels \n which the gold-filleted Hours wear themselves whenever they go \n to their father's house to join the lovely dances of the gods. And when they had fully decked her, ",

Each one of them prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, \n so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea.\n Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess! \n Grant that I may gain the victory in this contest, ",
