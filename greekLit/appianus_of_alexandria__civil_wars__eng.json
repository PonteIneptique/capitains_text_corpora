Once when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplebeians were going to a war they fell into such a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontroversy, but they did not use the weapons in their hands, but withdrew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the hill, which from this time on was called the Sacred Mount. Even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen no violence was done, but they created a magistrate for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotection and called him the tribune of the plebs, to serve especially as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcheck upon the consuls, who were chosen by the Senate, so that the political\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower should not be exclusively in their hands. Whence arose still greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbitterness, and the magistrates were arrayed in stronger animosity to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother after this event, and the Senate and plebeians took sides with them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach believing that it would prevail over the other by augmenting the power\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof its own magistrates. In the midst of contests of this kind Marcius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCoriolanus, having been banished contrary to justice, took refuge with the Volsci and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevied war against his country. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the only case of armed strife that can be found in the ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseditions, and this was caused by an exile. The sword was never carried into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tand there was no civil butchery until Tiberius Gracchus, while serving as tribune and bringing forward new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaws, was the first to fall a victim to internal commotion; and many others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesides, who were assembled with him at the Capitol, were slain around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemple. Sedition did not end with this abominable deed. Repeatedly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparties came into open conflict, often carrying daggers; and occasionally in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe temples, or the assemblies, or the forum, some one serving as tribune,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor pr\u00e6tor, or consul, or a candidate for those offices, or some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson otherwise distinguished, would be slain. Unseemly violence prevailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost constantly, together with shameful contempt for law and justice. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe evil gained in magnitude open insurrections against the government and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge warlike expeditions against the country were undertaken by exiles, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcriminals, or persons contending against each other for some office or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary command. There were chiefs of factions in different places aspiring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto supreme power, some of them refusing to disband the troops intrusted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem by the people, others levying forces against each other on their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount, without public authority. Whichever of them first got possession of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city, the others made war nominally against their adversaries, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactually against their country. They assailed it like a foreign enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRuthless and indiscriminate massacres of citizens were perpetrated. Men were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribed, others banished, property was confiscated, and some were even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjected to excruciating tortures. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t No unseemly deed was wanting until, about fifty years after the death of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus, Cornelius Sulla, one of these chiefs of factions, doctoring one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevil with another, made himself the absolute master of the state for an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindefinite period. Such officials were formerly called dictators -- an\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice created in the most perilous emergencies for six months only, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong since fallen into disuse. Sulla, although nominally elected, became\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdictator for life by force and compulsion. Nevertheless he became satiated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t with power and was the first man, so far as I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow, holding \n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupreme power, who had the courage to lay it down voluntarily and to declare that he would render an account of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstewardship to any who were dissatisfied with it. And so, for a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, he walked to the forum as a private citizen in the sight of all and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned home unmolested, so great was the awe of his government still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining in the minds of the onlookers, or their amazement at his laying it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown. Perhaps they were ashamed to call for an accounting, or entertained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother good feeling toward him, or a belief that his despotism had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial to the state. Thus there was a cessation of factions for a short\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime while Sulla lived, and a compensation for the evils which Sulla had\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrought. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After his death the troubles broke out afresh and continued until Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, who had held the command in Gaul by election for some years, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered by the Senate to lay down his command. He charged that it was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe wish of the Senate, but of Pompey, his enemy, who had command of an army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Italy , and was scheming to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepose him. So he sent a proposal that both should retain their armies, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat neither need fear the other's enmity, or that Pompey should dismiss his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces also and live as a private citizen under the laws in like manner with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim-self. Both requests being refused, he marched from Gaul against Pompey in the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterritory, entered it, put him to flight, pursued him into Thessaly , won a brilliant victory over him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a great battle, and followed him to \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Egypt . After Pompey had been slain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Egyptians C\u00e6sar set to work on the affairs of Egypt and remained there until he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsettled the dynasty of that country. Then he returned to Rome . Having overpowered by war his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprincipal rival, who had been surnamed the Great on account of his brilliant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary exploits, he now ruled without disguise, nobody daring any longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto dispute him about anything, and was chosen, next after Sulla, dictator\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor life. Again all civil dissensions ceased until Brutus and Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvious of his great power and desiring to restore the government of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfathers, slew in the Senate this most popular man, who was also the one most\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperienced in the art of government. The people mourned for him greatly. They scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey buried him in the middle of the forum and built a temple on the place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his funeral pile, and offered sacrifice to him as a god. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t And now civil discord broke out again worse than ever and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased enormously. Massacres, banishments, and proscriptions of both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators and the so-called knights took place straightway, including great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumbers of both classes, the chief of factions surrendering their enemies to\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other, and for this purpose not sparing even their friends and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrothers; so much does animosity toward rivals overpower the love of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkindred. So in the course of events the Roman empire was partitioned, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough it had been their private property, by these three men: Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, and the one who was first called Octavius, but afterward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar from his relationship to the other C\u00e6sar and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadoption in his will. Shortly after this division they fell to quarrelling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong themselves, as was natural, and Octavius, who was the superior in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding and skill, first deprived Lepidus of Africa , which had fallen to his lot, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t afterward,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the result of the battle of Actium , took from Antony all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces lying between Syria and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Adriatic gulf. Thereupon, while all the world was filled with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tastonishment at these wonderful displays of power, he sailed to Egypt and took that country, which was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toldest and at that time the strongest possession of the successors of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander, and the only one wanting to complete the Roman empire as it now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstands. In consequence of these exploits he was at once elevated to the rank of a deity\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile still living, and was the first to be thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinguished by the Romans, and was called by them Augustus. He assumed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself an authority like C\u00e6sar's over the country and the subject\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnations, and even greater than C\u00e6sar's, not needing any form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection, or authorization, or even the pretence of it. His government being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened by time and mastery, and himself successful in all things and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevered by all, he left a lineage and succession that held the supreme power\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin like manner after him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus, out of multifarious civil commotions, the Roman state passed into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolidarity and monarchy. To show how these things came about I have written\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand compiled piled this narrative, which is well worth the study of those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho wish to know the measureless ambition of men, their dreadful lust of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower, their unwearying perseverance, and the countless forms of evil. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially necessary for me to describe these things beforehand since they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the preliminaries of my Egyptian history, and end where that begins, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Egypt was seized in consequence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this last civil commotion, Cleopatra having joined forces with Antony. On\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of its magnitude I have divided the work, first taking up the events\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat occurred from the time of Sempronius Gracchus to that of Cornelius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla; next, those that followed to the death of C\u00e6sar. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining books of the civil wars treat of those waged by the triumvirs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst each other and the Roman people, until the end of these conflicts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the greatest achievement, the battle of Actium , fought by Octavius C\u00e6sar against Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Cleopatra together, which will be the beginning of the Egyptian\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistory. \n\t\t\t\t"},"1":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Romans, as they subdued the Italian nations successively in war, seized a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of their lands and built towns there, or established their own colonies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin those already existing, and used them in place of garrisons. Of the land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquired by war they assigned the cultivated part forthwith to settlers, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleased or sold it. Since they had no leisure as yet to allot the part which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen lay desolated by war (this was generally the greater part), they made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclamation that in the meantime those who were willing to work it might do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso for a share of the yearly crops a tenth of the grain and a fifth of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfruit. From those who kept flocks was required a share of the animals, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\toxen and small cattle. They did these things in order to multiply the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian race, which they considered the most laborious of peoples, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey might have plenty of allies at home. But the very opposite thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappened; for the rich, getting possession of the greater part of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundistributed lands, and being emboldened by the lapse of time to believe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they would never be dispossessed, and adding to their holdings the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall farms of their poor neighbors, partly by purchase and partly by force,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame to cultivate vast tracts instead of single estates, using for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose slaves as laborers and herdsmen, lest free laborers should be drawn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom agriculture into the army. The ownership of slaves itself brought them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat gain from the multitude of their progeny, who increased because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere exempt from military service. Thus the powerful ones became enormously\n\t\t\t\t\t\trich and the race of slaves multiplied throughout the country, while the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian people dwindled in numbers and strength, being oppressed by penury,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaxes, and military service. If they had any respite from these evils they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed their time in idleness, because the land was held by the rich, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployed slaves instead of freemen as cultivators. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For these reasons the people became troubled lest they should no longer have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient allies of the Italian stock, and lest the government itself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be endangered by such a vast number of slaves. Not perceiving any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremedy, as it was not easy, nor exactly just, to deprive men of so many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessions they had held so long, including their own trees, buildings, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfixtures, a law was once passed with difficulty at the instance of the tribunes, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t nobody should hold more than 500 jugera of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tland, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tor pasture on it more than 100 cattle or 500 sheep. To ensure the observance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this law it was provided also that there should be a certain number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreemen employed on the farms, whose business it should be to watch and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treport what was going on. Those who held possession of lands under the law\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere required to take an oath to obey the law, and penalties were fixed for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolating it, and it was supposed that the remaining land would soon be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided among the poor in small parcels. But there was not the smallest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsideration shown for the law or the oaths. The few who seemed to pay some\n\t\t\t\t\t\trespect to them conveyed their lands to their relations fraudulently, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe greater part disregarded it altogether. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At length Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, an illustrious man, eager for glory,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta most powerful speaker, and for these reasons well known to all, delivered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan eloquent discourse, while serving as tribune, concerning the Italian\n\t\t\t\t\t\trace, lamenting that a people so valiant in war, and blood relations to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, were declining little by little in pauperism and paucity of numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any hope of remedy. He inveighed against the multitude of slaves as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseless in war and never faithful to their masters, and adduced the recent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalamity brought upon the masters by their slaves in Sicily , where the demands of agriculture\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad greatly increased the number of the latter; recalling also the war waged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst them by the Romans, which was neither easy nor short, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-protracted and full of vicissitudes and dangers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter speaking thus he again brought forward the law, providing that nobody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould hold more than 500 jugera of the public domain. But he added a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovision to the former law, that the sons of the present occupiers might\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach hold one-half of that amount, and that the remainder should be divided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the poor by triumvirs, who should be changed annually. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This was extremely disturbing to the rich because, on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirs, they could no longer disregard the law as they had done before;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor could they buy the allotments of others, because Gracchus had provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst this by forbidding sales. They collected together in groups, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade lamentation, and accused the poor of appropriating the results of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttillage, their vineyards, and their dwellings. Some said that they had paid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe price of the land to their neighbors. Were they to lose the money with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land? Others said that the graves of their ancestors were in the ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been allotted to them in the division of their fathers' estates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOthers said that their wives' dowries had been expended on the estates, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the land had been given to their own daughters as dowry. Money-lenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould show loans made on this security. All kinds of wailing and expressions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof indignation were heard at once. On the other side were heard the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamentations of the poor--that they had been reduced from competence to\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme penury, and from that to childlessness, because they were unable to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trear their offspring. They recounted the military services they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendered, by which this very land had been acquired, and were angry that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should be robbed of their share of the common property. They reproached\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rich for employing slaves, who were always faithless and ill-tempered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand for that reason unserviceable in war, instead of freemen, citizens, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers. While these classes were lamenting and indulging in mutual\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccusations, a great number of others, composed of colonists, or inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the free towns, or persons otherwise interested in the lands and who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder like apprehensions, flocked in and took sides with their respective\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactions. Emboldened by numbers and exasperated against each other they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattached themselves to turbulent crowds, and waited for the voting on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew law, some trying to prevent its enactment by all means, and others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting it in every possible way. In addition to personal interest the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit of rivalry spurred both sides in the preparations they were making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst each other for the day of the comitia. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t What Gracchus had in his mind in proposing the measure was not wealth, but an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease of efficient population. Inspired greatly by the usefulness of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork, and believing that nothing more advantageous or admirable could ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen to Italy , he took no account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the difficulties surrounding it. When the time for voting came he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced many other arguments at considerable length and also asked them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether it was not just to divide among the common people what belonged to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem in common; whether a citizen was not worthy of more consideration at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall times than a slave; whether a man who served in the army was not more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseful than one who did not; and whether one who had a share in the country\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not more likely to be devoted to the public interests. He did not dwell\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong on this comparison between freemen and slaves, which he considered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdegrading, but proceeded at once to a review of their hopes and fears for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe country, saying that the Romans had acquired most of their territory by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquest, and that they had hopes of occupying the rest of the habitable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld, but now the question of greatest hazard was, whether they should gain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rest by having plenty of brave men, or whether, through their weakness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand mutual jealousy, their enemies should take away what they already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessed. After exaggerating the glory and riches on the one side and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger and fear on the other, he admonished the rich to take heed, and said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat for the realization of these, hopes they ought to bestow this very land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a free gift, if necessary, on men who would rear children, and not, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontending about small things, overlook larger ones; especially since they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere receiving an ample compensation for labor expended in the undisputed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttitle to 500 jugera each of free land, in a high state of cultivation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout cost, and half as much more for each son of those who had sons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter saying much more to the same purport and exciting the poor, as well as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers who were moved by reason rather than by the desire for gain, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered the scribe to read the proposed law. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Marcus Octavius, another tribune, who had been induced by those in possession\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the lands to interpose his veto (for among the Romans the tribune's veto\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways prevailed), ordered the scribe to keep silence. Thereupon Gracchus\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached him severely and adjourned the comitia to the following day. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the stationed a sufficient guard, as if to force Octavius against his will,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ordered the scribe with threats to read the proposed law to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude. He began to read, but when Octavius again vetoed he stopped. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tribunes fell to wrangling with each other, and a considerable tumult\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarose among the people. The leading citizens besought the tribunes to submit\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir controversy to the Senate for decision. Gracchus seized on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggestion, believing that the law was acceptable to all well-disposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons, and hastened to the senate-house. There, as he had only a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowers and was upbraided by the rich, he ran back to the forum and said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would take the vote at the comitia of the following day, both on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw and on the magistracy of Octavius, to determine whether a tribune who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas acting contrary to the people's interest could continue to hold his\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice. And so he did, for when Octavius, nothing daunted, again interposed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus distributed the pebbles to take a vote on him first. When the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribe voted to abrogate the magistracy of Octavius, Gracchus turned to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand begged him to desist from this veto. As he would not yield, the votes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other tribes were taken. There were thirty-five tribes at that time. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseventeen that voted first angrily sustained this motion. If the eighteenth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould do the same it would make a majority. Again did Gracchus, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsight of the people, urgently importune Octavius in his present extreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger not to prevent this most pious work, so useful to all Italy , and not to frustrate the wishes so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearnestly entertained by the people, whose desires he ought rather to share\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his character of tribune, and not to risk the loss of his office by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic condemnation. After speaking thus he called the gods to witness that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the did not willingly do any despite to his colleague. As Octavius was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunyielding he went on taking the vote. Octavius was forthwith reduced to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trank of a private citizen and slunk away unobserved. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Quintus Mummius was chosen tribune in his place, and the agrarian law was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenacted. The first triumvirs appointed to divide the land were Gracchus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, the proposer of the law, his brother of the same name, and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather-in-law, Appius Claudius, since the people still feared that the law\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight fail of execution unless Gracchus should be put in the lead with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole family. Gracchus became immensely popular by reason of the law and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescorted home by the multitude as though he were the founder, not of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle city or race, but of all the nations of Italy . After, this the victorious party returned to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfields from which they had come to attend to this business. The defeated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones remained in the city and talked the matter over, feeling bitterly, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying that as soon as Gracchus should become a private citizen he would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsorry that he had done despite to the sacred and inviolable office of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune, and had opened such a fountain of discord in Italy . \n\t\t\t\t"},"2":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At the advent of summer the notices for the election of tribunes were given,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand as the day for voting approached it was very evident that the rich were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearnestly promoting the election of those most inimical to Gracchus. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter, fearing that evil would befall if he should not be reelected for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing year, summoned his friends from the fields to attend the comitia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut as they were occupied with their harvest he was obliged, when the day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfixed for the voting drew near, to have recourse to the plebeians of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity. So he went around asking each one separately to elect him tribune for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ensuing year, on account of the danger he had incurred for them. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe voting took place the first two tribes pronounced for Gracchus. The rich\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobjected that it was not lawful for the same man to hold the office twice in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccession. The tribune Rubrius, who had been chosen by lot to preside over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe comitia, was in doubt about it, and Mummius, who had been chosen in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace of Octavius, urged him to turn over the comitia to his charge. This he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid, but the remaining tribunes contended that the presidency should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided by lot, saying that when Rubrius, who had been chosen in that way,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresigned, the casting of lots ought to be done over again for all. As there\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas much strife over this question, Gracchus, who was getting the worst of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, adjourned the voting to the following day. In utter despair he clothed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself in black, while still in office, and led his son around the forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand introduced him to each man and committed him to their charge, as if he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere about to perish at the hands of his enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The poor were moved with deep sorrow, and rightly so, both on their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount (for they believed that they were no longer to live in a free state\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder equal laws, but were reduced to servitude by the rich), and on account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Gracchus himself, who had incurred such danger and suffering in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehalf. So they all accompanied him with tears to his house in the evening,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand bade him be of good courage for the morrow. Gracchus cheered up,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembled his partisans before daybreak, and communicated to them a signal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be displayed in case of a fight. He then took possession of the temple on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Capitoline hill, where the voting was to take place, and occupied the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of the assembly. As he was obstructed by the other tribunes and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rich, who would not allow the votes to be taken on this question, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave the signal. There was a sudden shout from those who saw it, and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresort to violence in consequence. Some of the partisans of Gracchus took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition around him like body-guards. Others, having girded themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseized the fasces and staves in the hands of the lictors and broke them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpieces. They drove the rich out of the assembly with such disorder and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounds that the tribunes fled from their places in terror, and the priests\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosed the doors of the temple. Many ran away pell-mell and scattered wild\n\t\t\t\t\t\trumors. Some said that Gracchus had deposed all the other tribunes, and this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas believed because none of them could be seen. Others said that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared himself tribune for the ensuing year without an election. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Under these circumstances the Senate assembled at the temple of Fides. It is astonishing to me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they never thought of appointing a dictator in this emergency, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had often been protected by the government of a single ruler in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes of peril. Although this resource had been found most useful in former\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes few people remembered it, either then or later. After reaching the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision that they did reach, they marched up to the Capitol, Cornelius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio Nasica, the pontifex maximus, leading the way and calling out with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloud voice, \"Let those who would save the country follow me.\" He wound the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborder of his toga about his head either to induce a greater number to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him by the singularity of his appearance, or to make for himself, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere, a helmet as a sign of battle for those who looked on, or in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconceal from the gods what he was about to do. When he arrived at the temple\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand advanced against the partisans of Gracchus they yielded to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treputation of a foremost citizen, for they saw the Senate following with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. The latter wrested clubs out of the hands of the Gracchans themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor with fragments of broken benches or other apparatus that had been brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the use of the assembly, began beating them, and pursued them, and drove\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem over the precipice. In the tumult\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany of the Gracchans perished, and Gracchus himself was caught near the temple, and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain at the door close by the statues of the kings. All the bodies were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrown by night into the Tiber . \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So perished on the Capitol, and while still tribune, Gracchus, the son of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus who was twice consul, and of Cornelia, daughter of that Scipio who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjugated Carthage . He lost\n\t\t\t\t\t\this life in consequence of a most excellent design, which, however, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued in too violent a manner. This shocking affair, the first that was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperpetrated in the public assembly, was seldom without parallels thereafter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom time to time. On the subject of the murder of Gracchus the city was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided between sorrow and joy. Some mourned for themselves and for him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeplored the present condition of things, believing that the commonwealth no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger existed, but had been supplanted by force and violence. Others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered that everything had turned out for them exactly as they wished.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese things took place at the time when Aristonicus was contending with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans for the government of Asia . \n\t\t\t\t"},"3":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After Gracchus was slain Appius Claudius died, and Fulvius Flaccus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPapirius Carbo were appointed, in conjunction with the younger Gracchus, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivide the land. As the persons in possession neglected to hand in lists of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir holdings, a proclamation was issued that informers should furnish\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttestimony against them. Immediately a great number of embarrassing lawsuits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsprang up. Wherever a new field had been bought adjoining an old one, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever a division of land had been made with allies, the whole district\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad to be carefully inquired into on account of the measurement of this one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfield, to discover how it had been sold and how divided. Not all owners had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreserved their contracts, or their allotment titles, and even those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere found were often ambiguous. When the land was resurveyed some owners\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere obliged to give up their fruit-trees and farm-buildings in exchange for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnaked ground. Others were transferred from cultivated to uncultivated lands,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor to swamps, or pools. In fact, the measuring had not been carefully done\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the land was first taken from the enemy. As the original proclamation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorized anybody to work the undistributed land who wished to do so, many\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been prompted to cultivate the parts immediately adjoining their own,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttill the line of demarkation between them had faded from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview. The progress of time also made many changes. Thus the injustice done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the rich, although great, was not easy of ascertainment. So there was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing but a general turn-about, all parties being moved out of their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaces and settled down in other people's. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Italian allies who complained of these disturbances, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially of the lawsuits hastily brought against them, chose Cornelius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio, the destroyer of Carthage , to defend them against these grievances. As he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad availed himself of their very valiant services in war he was reluctant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto disregard their request. So he came into the Senate, and although, out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard for the plebeians, he did not openly find fault with the law of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus, he expatiated on its difficulties and held that these causes ought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to be decided by the triumvirs, because they did not possess the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence of the litigants, but should be turned over to others. As his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview seemed reasonable, they yielded to his persuasion, and the consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTuditanus was appointed to give judgment in these cases. But when he took\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold of the work he saw the difficulties of it, and marched against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIllyrians as a pretext for not acting as judge, and since nobody brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcases for trial before the triumvirs they relapsed into idleness. From this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause hatred and indignation arose among the people against Scipio because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw him, in whose favor they had often opposed the aristocracy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincurred their enmity, electing him consul twice contrary to law, now taking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe side of the Italian allies against them. When Scipio's enemies observed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, they cried out that he was determined to abolish the law of Gracchus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutterly and was about to inaugurate armed strife and bloodshed for that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the people heard these charges they were in a state of alarm until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio, after placing near his couch at home one evening a tablet on which\n\t\t\t\t\t\the intended to write during the night the speech he intended to deliver\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the people, was found dead in his bed without a wound. Whether this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas done by Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi (aided by her daughter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSempronia, who was married to Scipio, and was unloved and unloving because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshe was deformed and childless), lest the law of Gracchus should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabolished, or whether, as some think, he committed suicide because he saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplainly that he could not accomplish what he had promised, is not known.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome say that slaves, who were subjected to torture, testified that unknown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons were introduced through the rear of the house by night who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffocated him, and that those who knew about it hesitated to tell because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people were angry with him still and rejoiced at his death. So died\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio, and although he had been of immense service to the Roman power he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not honored with a public funeral; so much does the anger of the present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoment outweigh gratitude for the past. And this event, sufficiently\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant in itself, took place as an incident of the sedition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who were in possession of the lands even after these events postponed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe division on various pretexts for a very long time. Some thought that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian allies, who made the greatest resistance to it, ought to be admitted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Roman citizenship so that, out of gratitude for the greater favor, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould no longer quarrel about the land. The Italians were glad to accept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, because they preferred Roman citizenship to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of the fields. Fulvius Flaccus, who was then both consul and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvir, exerted himself to the utmost to bring it about, but the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas angry at the proposal to make their subjects equal citizens with themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor this reason the attempt was abandoned, and the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had been so long in the hope of acquiring land, became disheartened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile they were in this mood Gaius Gracchus, who had made himself agreeable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them as a triumvir, offered himself for the tribuneship. He was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyounger brother of Tiberius Gracchus, the promoter of the law, and had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilent for some time on the subject of the fate of his brother, but since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany of the senators treated him scornfully he announced himself as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcandidate for the office of tribune. As soon as he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\telected to this distinguished position he began to lay plots against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and proposed that a monthly distribution of corn should be made to\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach citizen at the public expense, which had not been customary before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThus he got the leadership of the people quickly by one measure of policy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin which he had the co\u00f6peration of Fulvius Flaccus. Directly after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was chosen tribune for the following year, for in cases where there\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not a sufficient number of candidates the law authorized the people to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoose from the whole number then in office. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus Gaius Gracchus became tribune a second time. Having bought the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplebeians, as it were, he began, by another like political\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman\u0153uvre, to court the equestrian order, who hold the middle place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the Senate and the plebeians. He transferred the courts of justice,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had become discredited by reason of bribery, from the senators to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights, reproaching the former especially with the recent examples of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAurelius Cotta, Salinator, and, third in the list, Manius Aquilius (the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho subdued Asia ), all notorious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbribe-takers, who had been acquitted by the judges, although ambassadors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent to complain against them were still present, going around uttering\n\t\t\t\t\t\thateful accusations against them. The Senate was extremely ashamed of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings and yielded to the law, and the people ratified it. In this way were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe courts of justice transferred from the Senate to the knights. It is said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat soon after the passage of this law Gracchus remarked that he had broken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe power of the Senate once for all. This saying of Gracchus has been even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore confirmed by experience in the course of events. This power of sitting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin judgment on all Romans and Italians, including the senators themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all matters as to property, civil rights, and banishment, exalted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights like rulers over them and put senators on the same level with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjects. Moreover, as the knights voted in the election to sustain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower of the tribunes, and obtained from them whatever they wanted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn, they became more and more formidable to the senators. So it shortly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame about that the political mastery was turned upside down, the power\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in the hands of the knights, and the honor only remaining with the Senate. The knights went so far that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot only held power over the senators, but they openly flouted them beyond\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir right. They also became addicted to bribe-taking, and having once\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttasted these enormous gains, they indulged in them even more basely and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmoderately than the senators had done. They suborned accusers against the rich and did away with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprosecutions for bribe-taking altogether, partly by concert of action and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly by force and violence, so that the practice of this kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestigation became entirely obsolete. Thus the judiciary law gave rise to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother struggle of factions, which lasted a long time and was not less\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbaneful than the former ones. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gracchus made long roads throughout Italy and thus put a multitude of contractors and artisans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder obligations to him and made them ready to do whatever he wished. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the founding of numerous colonies. He also called on the Latin allies to demand the full\n\t\t\t\t\t\trights of Roman citizenship, since the Senate could not with decency refuse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis privilege to their blood relations. To the other allies, who were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed to vote in Roman elections, he sought to give the right of suffrage,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to have their help in the enactment of laws which he had in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontemplation. The Senate was very much alarmed at this, and it ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls to give the following public notice, \"Nobody who does not possess\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right of suffrage shall stay in the city or approach within forty stades\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it while voting is going on concerning these laws.\" The Senate also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuaded Livius Drusus, another tribune, to interpose his veto against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaws proposed by Gracchus, but not to tell the people his reasons for doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso; for a tribune was not required to give reasons for his veto. In order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconciliate the people they gave Drusus the privilege of founding twelve\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies, and the plebeians were so much pleased with this that they began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto scoff at the laws proposed by Gracchus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having lost the favor of the rabble, Gracchus sailed for Africa in company with Fulvius Flaccus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho, after his consulship, had been chosen tribune for the same reasons as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus himself. A colony had been voted to Africa on account of its reputed fertility, and these men\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been expressly chosen the founders of it in order to get them out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway for a while, so that the Senate might have a respite from demagogism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey marked out a town for the colony on the place where Carthage had formerly stood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarding the fact that Scipio, when he destroyed it, had devoted it with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurses to sheep-pasturage forever. They assigned 6000 colonists to this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, instead of the smaller number fixed by law, in order further to curry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavor with the people thereby. When they returned to Rome they invited the 6000 from the whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Italy . The functionaries who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still in Africa laying out the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity wrote home that wolves had pulled up and scattered the boundary marks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade by Gracchus and Fulvius, and the soothsayers considered this an ill\n\t\t\t\t\t\tomen for the colony. So the Senate summoned the comitia, in which it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed to repeal the law concerning this colony. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus and Fulvius saw their failure in this matter they were furious, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared that the Senate had lied about the wolves. The boldest of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplebeians joined them, carrying daggers, and proceeded to the Capitol, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly was to be held in reference to the colony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the people were assembled, and Fulvius had begun speaking about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness in hand, when Gracchus arrived at the Capitol attended by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody-guard of his partisans. Disturbed by what he knew about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\textraordinary plans on foot he turned aside from the meeting-place of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembly, passed into the portico, and walked about waiting to see what\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould happen. Just then a plebeian named Antyllus, who was sacrificing in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe portico, saw him in this disturbed state, seized him by the hand, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he had heard something or suspected something, or was moved to speak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him for some other reason, and asked him to spare his country. Gracchus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill more disturbed, and startled like one detected in a crime, gave the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman a piercing look. Then one of his party, although no signal had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed or order given, inferred merely from the very sharp glance that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus cast upon Antyllus that the time for action had come, and thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he should do a favor to Gracchus by striking the first blow. So he drew\n\t\t\t\t\t\this dagger and slew Antyllus. A cry was raised, the dead body was seen in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe midst of the crowd, and all who were outside fled from the temple in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of a like fate. Gracchus went into the assembly desiring to exculpate\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself of the deed. Nobody would so much as listen to him. All turned away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom him as from one stained with blood. Gracchus and Flaccus were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnonplussed and, having lost the chance of accomplishing what they wished,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey hastened home, and their partisans with them. The rest of the crowd\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccupied the forum throughout the night as though some calamity were\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpending. Opimius, one of the consuls, who was staying in the city, ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan armed force to be stationed at the Capitol at daybreak, and sent heralds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto convoke the Senate. He took his own station in the temple of Castor and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPollux in the centre of the city and there awaited events. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When these arrangements had been made the Senate summoned Gracchus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlaccus from their homes to the senate-house to defend themselves. But they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tran out armed toward the Aventine \n\t\t\t\t\t\thill, hoping that if they could seize it first the Senate would agree to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome terms with them. They ran through the city offering freedom to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves, but none listened to them. With such forces as they had, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey occupied and fortified the temple of Diana, and sent Quintus, the son\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Flaccus, to the Senate seeking to come to an arrangement and to live in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace. The Senate replied that they should lay down their arms, come to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenate-house, tell what they wanted, or else send no more messengers. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey sent Quintus a second time the consul Opimius arrested him, as being no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger an ambassador after he had been warned, and at the same time sent an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmed force against the Gracchans. Gracchus fled across the river by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSublician bridge, with one slave, to a grove where he presented his throat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the slave, as he was on the point of being arrested. Flaccus took refuge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the workshop of an acquaintance. As his pursuers did not know which house\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was in they threatened to burn the whole row. The man who had given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshelter to the suppliant hesitated to point him out, but directed another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman to do so. Flaccus was seized and put to death. The heads of Gracchus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlaccus were carried to Opimius, and he gave their weight in gold to those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho brought them. The people plundered their houses. Opimius arrested their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-conspirators, cast them into prison, and ordered that they should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangled. He allowed Quintus, the son of Flaccus, to choose his own mode of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. After this a lustration was performed in behalf of the city for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbloodshed, and the Senate ordered the building of a temple to Concord in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum. \n\t\t\t\t"},"4":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So the sedition of the younger Gracchus came to an end. Not long afterward a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw was enacted to permit the holders to sell the land about which they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarrelled; for even this had been forbidden by the law of the elder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGracchus. Presently the rich bought the allotments of the poor, or found\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretexts for seizing them by force. So the condition of the poor became even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworse than it was before, until Spurius Borius, a tribune of the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought in a law providing that the work of distributing the public domain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould no longer be continued, but that the land should belong to those in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of it, who should pay rent for it to the people, and that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney so received should be distributed. This distribution was a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolace to the poor, but it did not serve to increase the population. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese devices the law of Gracchus (most excellent and useful if it could\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been carried out) was once for all frustrated, and a little later the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trent itself was abolished at the instance of another tribune. So the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiebeians lost everything. Whence resulted a still further decline in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumbers of both citizens and soldiers, and in the revenue from the land and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe distribution thereof; and about fifteen years after the enactment of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw of Gracchus, the laws themselves fell into abeyance by reason of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslackness of the judicial proceedings. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About this time the consul Scipio [Nasica] demolished the theatre begun by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius Cassius, and now nearly finished, because he considered this also the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of new seditions or because he thought it not altogether desirable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the Romans should become accustomed to Grecian pleasures. The censor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQuintus C\u00e6celius Metellus, attempted to degrade Glaucia, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenator, and Apuleius Saturninus, who had already been a tribune, on account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their disgraceful mode of life, but was not able to do so because his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot agree to it. Accordingly Saturninus, a little later, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to have revenge on Metellus, became a candidate for the tribuneship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain, seizing the occasion when Glaucia held the office of pr\u00e6tor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand presided over the election of the tribunes; but Nonius, a man of noble\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirth, who used much plainness of speech in reference to Saturninus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached Glaucia bitterly, was chosen for the office. As they feared lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\the should punish them as tribune, they made a rush upon him with a crowd of\n\t\t\t\t\t\truffians just as he was going away from the comitia, pursued him into a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain inn, and stabbed him. As this murder had a pitiful and shocking\n\t\t\t\t\t\taspect, the adherents of Glaucia came together early the next morning,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the people had assembled, and declared Saturninus elected tribune. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis way the killing of Nonius was hushed up, since everybody was afraid to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcall Saturninus to account because he was a tribune. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Metellus was banished by them at the instigation of Gaius Marius, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen in his sixth consulship, and was the secret enemy of Metellus. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey all helped each other. Saturninus brought forward a law to divide the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland which the Cimbri (a Celtic tribe lately driven out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius) had seized in the country now called Gaul by the Romans, and which was considered as no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGallic but Roman territory. It was provided also in this law that if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople should enact it the senators should take an oath within five days to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobey it, and that any one who should refuse to do so should be expelled from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate and should pay a fine of twenty talents for the benefit of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople. Thus they intended to punish those who should take it with a bad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrace, and especially Metellus, who was too high-spirited to submit to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toath. Such was the proposed law. Saturninus appointed the day for holding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe comitia and sent messengers to summon from the country districts those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin whom he had most confidence, because they had served in the army under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius. As the law gave the larger share to the Italian allies the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were not pleased with it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sedition broke out in the comitia. Those who attempted to prevent the passage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the laws proposed by the tribunes were assaulted by Saturninus and driven\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway from the rostra. The city folks exclaimed that thunder was heard in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembly, in which case it is not permitted by Roman custom to finish the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness that day. As the adherents of Saturninus persisted nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city people girded themselves, seized whatever clubs they could lay\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir hands on, and dispersed the rustics. The latter were rallied by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturninus; they attacked the city folks with clubs, overcame them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed the law. When this was done Marius, in his capacity as consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthwith proposed to the Senate that they consider concerning taking the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toath. Knowing that Metellus was a man of fixed opinion and firm in whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\the might believe or commit himself to, he gave his own opinion publicly, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeceitfully, saying that he would never willingly take this oath himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Metellus had agreed with him in this, and the others had praised them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth, Marius adjourned the Senate. On the fifth day thereafter (the last day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprescribed in the law for taking the oath) he called them together in haste\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the tenth hour, saying that he was afraid of the people because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere so zealous for the law. He saw a way, however, to avoid it, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the following trick--to swear that they would obey the law as far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas it was a law, and thus at once disperse the country people by stratagem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfterward it could be easily shown that this thing, which had been enacted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby violence and in spite of thunder, contrary to the custom of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancestors, was not a law. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After speaking thus he did not wait for the result, but while all were in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilent amazement at the plot, and confused because there was no time to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost and no opportunity for thinking, he rose and went to the temple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturn, where the qu\u00e6stors were accustomed to administer oaths,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand took the oath first with his friends. The rest followed his example, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach one feared for his own safety. Metellus alone refused to swear, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstood fearlessly by his first determination. Saturninus proceeded against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim at once on the next day. He sent an officer for him and dragged him out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the senate-house. As the other tribunes defended him Glaucia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturninus hastened to the country people and told them that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever get the land, and that the law would not be executed, unless Metellus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere banished. They proposed a decree of banishment against him and directed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls to interdict fire and water and shelter to him, and appointed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday for the ratification of this decree. Great was the indignation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity people, who constantly escorted Metellus, carrying daggers. He thanked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and praised them for their good intentions, but said that he could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow any danger to befall the country on his account. After saying this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew from the city. Saturninus got the decree ratified, and Marius made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclamation that it was a part of the law. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way was Metellus, a most admirable man, sent into banishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThereupon Saturninus was made tribune a third time and he had for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague one who was thought to be a fugitive slave, but who claimed to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta son of the elder Gracchus. The multitude supported him in the election\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they regretted Gracchus. When the election for consuls came on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Antonius was chosen as one of them by common consent. The aforesaid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlaucia and Memmius contended for the other place. Memmius was the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillustrious man by far, and Glaucia and Saturninus were fearful of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult. So they sent a gang of ruffians to attack him with clubs while the\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection was going on. They fell upon him in the midst of the comitia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeat him to death in the sight of all. The assembly was broken up in terror.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNeither laws nor courts nor sense of shame remained. The people ran together\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin anger the following day intending to kill Saturninus, but he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected another mob from the country and, with Glaucia and Gaius Saufeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe qu\u00e6stor, seized the Capitol. The Senate voted them public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Marius was vexed; nevertheless he armed some of his forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\treluctantly, and, while he was delaying, some other persons cut off the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater-supply from the Capitoline temple. Saufeius was near perishing with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst and proposed to set the temple on fire, but Glaucia and Saturninus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho hoped that Marius would assist them, surrendered first, and after them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaufeius. As everybody demanded that they should be put to death, Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshut them up in the senate-house as though he intended to deal with them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more legal manner. The crowd considered this a mere pretext. They tore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttiles off the roof and stoned them to death, including a qu\u00e6stor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tribune, and a pr\u00e6tor, who were still wearing their insignia of\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Very many others were swept out of existence in this sedition. Among them was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat other tribune who was supposed to be the son of Gracchus, and who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished on that first day of his magistracy. Freedom, democracy, laws,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treputation, official position, were no longer of any use to anybody, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven the tribunician office, which had been devised for the restraint of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrong-doers and the protection of the plebeians, and was sacred and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinviolable, now committed such outrages and suffered such indignities. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe party of Saturninus was destroyed the Senate and people clamored for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecall of Metellus, but Publius Furius, a tribune who was not the son of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfree citizen but of a freedman, boldly resisted them. Not even Metellus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Metellus, who besought him in the presence of the people with tears\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his eyes, and threw himself at his feet, could move him. From this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspectacle the son ever afterward bore the name of Metellus Pius. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing year Furius was called to account for his obstinacy by the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune, Gaius Canuleius. The people did not wait for the argument, but tore Furius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin pieces. Thus every year some new deed of abomination was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitted in the forum. Metellus was allowed to return, and it is said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta whole day was not sufficient for the greetings of those who went to meet\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim at the city gates. Such was the third civil strife (that of Saturninus)\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich succeeded those of the two Gracchi, and such results it brought to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans. \n\t\t\t\t"},"5":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were thus occupied the so-called Social War, in which many Italian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeoples were engaged, broke out. It began unexpectedly, grew to great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproportions rapidly, and extinguished the Roman seditions for a long time by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta new terror. When it was ended it gave rise to new seditions under more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful leaders, who did not work by introducing new laws, or by playing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe demagogue, but by employing whole armies against each other. I have\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreated it in this history because it had its origin in a Roman sedition and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulted in another one much worse. It began in this way. Fulvius Flaccus in\n\t\t\t\t\t\this consulship first openly excited among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalians the desire for Roman citizenship, so as to be partners in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thegemony instead of subjects. When he introduced this idea and strenuously\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersisted in it, the Senate, for that reason, sent him away to take command\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a war, in the course of which his consulship expired, but he obtained the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribuneship after that and managed to have the younger Gracchus for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague, with whose co\u00f6peration he brought forward other measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin favor of the Italians. When they were both killed, as I have previously\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelated, the Italians were still more excited. They could not bear to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered subjects instead of equals, or to think that Flaccus and Gracchus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould suffer such calamities while working for their political advantage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After them the tribune Livius Drusus, a man of most \n\t\t\t\t\t\tillustrious birth, promised the Italians, at their urgent request, that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould bring forward a new law to give them citizenship. They desired this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially because by that one step they would become rulers instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjects. In order to conciliate the plebeians to this measure he led out to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Italy and Sicily several colonies which had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted some time before, but not yet planted. He endeavored to bring to an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement the Senate and the equestrian order, who were then in sharp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tantagonism to each other, in reference to the law courts. As he was not able\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto restore the courts to the Senate openly, he tried the following artifice\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton both of them. As the senators had been reduced by the seditions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscarcely 300 in number, he brought forward a law that an equal number should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe added to their enrolment from the knights, to be chosen according to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerit, and that the law courts should be made up from all of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\thereafter. He provided in the law that they should make investigations about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbribery, as accusations of that kind were almost unknown, since the custom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof bribe-taking prevailed without restraint. This was the plan that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrived for both of them, but it turned out contrary to his expectations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the senators were indignant that so large a number should be added to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir enrolment at one time and be transferred from knighthood to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighest rank. They thought it not unlikely that they would form a faction in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate by themselves and contend against the old senators more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerfully than ever. The knights, on the other hand, suspected that, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis doctoring, the courts of justice would be transferred from their order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Senate exclusively. Having acquired a relish for the great gains and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower of the judicial office, this suspicion disturbed them. Most of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell into doubt and distrust toward each other, discussing which ones seemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore worthy than others to be enrolled among the 300; and envy against their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetters filled the breasts of the remainder. Above all were they angry at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe revival of the charge of bribery, which they thought had been ere this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentirely suppressed, so far as they were concerned. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus it came to pass that both the Senate and the knights, although opposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto each other, were united in hating Drusus. Only the plebeians were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgratified with the colonies. The Italians, in whose interest chiefly Drusus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas devising these plans, were apprehensive about the law providing for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies, because they thought that the Roman public domain (which was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundivided and which they were cultivating, some by force and others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclandestinely) would be taken away from them, and that in many cases they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight even be disturbed in their private holdings. The Etruscans and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUmbrians had the same fears as the Italians, and when they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummoned to the city, as it was thought, by the consuls, ostensibly for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of complaining against the law of Drusus, but actually, as is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved, for the purpose of killing him, they cried down the law publicly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand waited for the day of the comitia. Drusus learned of the plot against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim and did not go out frequently, but transacted business from day to day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the atrium of his house, which was poorly lighted. One evening as he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsending the crowd away he exclaimed suddenly that he was wounded, and fell\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown while uttering the words. A shoemaker's knife was found thrust into his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thip. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus was Drusus also slain while serving as tribune. The knights, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake his policy a ground of accusation against their enemies, persuaded the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune Quintus Varius to bring forward a law to prosecute those who should,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither openly or secretly, aid the Italians to acquire citizenship. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\thoped to bring all the leaders under malicious indictment, and themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsit in judgment on them, and that when their enemies were out of the way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should be more powerful than ever in the government of Rome . When the other tribunes interposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir veto the knights surrounded them with drawn daggers and enacted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasure, whereupon accusers at once brought actions against the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillustrious of the senators. Of these Bestia did not respond, but went into\n\t\t\t\t\t\texile voluntarily rather than surrender himself into the hands of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. After him Cotta went before the court, made a brilliant defence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this administration of public affairs, and openly reviled the knights. He,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo, departed from the city before the vote of the judges was taken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMummius, the one who had conquered Greece , was basely ensnared by the knights, who promised to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquit him, but condemned him to banishment. He passed the remainder of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife at Delos . \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As this wickedness prevailed more and more against the best citizens, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were grieved because they were deprived all at once of so many men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had rendered such great services. When the Italians learned of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilling of Drusus and of the reason alleged for banishing the others, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered it no longer bearable that those who were laboring for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical advancement should suffer such outrages, and as they saw no other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans of acquiring citizenship they decided to revolt from the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\taltogether, and to make war against them with all their might. They sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvoys to each other secretly, formed a league, and exchanged hostages as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpledge of good faith. The Romans were in ignorance of these facts for a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, being preoccupied by the judicial proceedings and the seditions in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity. When they heard what was going on they sent men around to the towns,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoosing those who were best acquainted with each, to collect information\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquietly. One of these saw a young man who was being taken as a hostage from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe town of Asculum to another\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttown, and informed Servilius, the proconsul in those parts. (It appears that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were proconsuls at that time governing the various parts of Italy ; Hadrian revived the custom a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime afterward when he held the supreme power, but it did not long survive\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim.) Servilius hastened to Asculum and indulged in very menacing language to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, who were celebrating a festival, and they put him to death,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupposing that the plot was discovered. They also killed Fonteius, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegate (for so they call those of the senatorial order who accompany the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernors of provinces as assistants). After these were slain none of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother Romans in Asculum were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspared. The inhabitants fell upon them, slaughtered them all, and plundered\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir goods. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the revolt broke out all the neighboring peoples showed their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparedness at the same time, the Marsi, the Peligni, the Vestini, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarrucini; and after them the Picentines, the Frentani, the Hirpini, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeiians, the Venusini, the Apulians, the Lucanians, and the Samnites, all of whom had been hostile to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans before; also all the rest extending from the river Liris (which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow, I think, the Liternus) to the extremity of the Adriatic gulf, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinland and sea-coast. They sent ambassadors to Rome to complain that although they had co\u00f6perated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all ways with the Romans in building up the empire, the latter had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen willing to admit their helpers to citizenship. The Senate answered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsternly that if they repented of what they had done they could send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambassadors, otherwise not. The Italians, in despair of any other remedy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent on with their preparations for war. Besides the soldiers which were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkept for guards at each town, they had forces in common amounting to about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t100,000 foot and horse. The Romans sent an equal force against them, made up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their own citizens and of the Italian peoples who were still in alliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Romans were led by the consuls Sextus Julius C\u00e6sar and Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRutilius Lupus, for in this great civil war both consuls marched forth at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce, leaving the gates and walls in charge of others, as was customary in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcases of danger arising at home or very near by. When the war was found to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe complicated and many-sided, they sent their most renowned men as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlieutenant-generals to aid the consuls: to Rutilius, Gn\u00e6us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, the father of Pompey the Great, Quintus C\u00e6pio, Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerpenna, Gaius Marius, and Valerius Messala; to Sextus C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPublius Lentulus, a brother of C\u00e6sar himself, Titus Didius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLicinius Crassus, Cornelius Sulla, and Marcellus. All these served under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls and the country was divided among them. The consuls visited all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the field of operations, and the Romans sent them additional forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinually, knowing that it was a great conflict. The Italians had generals\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor their united forces besides those of the separate towns. The chief\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommanders were Titus Lafrenius, Gaius Pontilius, Marius Egnatius, Quintus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPomp\u00e6dius, Gaius Papius, Marcus Lamponius, Gaius Judacilius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHerius Asinius, and Vettius Cato. They divided their army in equal parts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook their positions against the Roman generals, performed many notable\n\t\t\t\t\t\texploits, and suffered many disasters. The most memorable events of each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclass I shall here summarize. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Vettius Cato defeated Sextus Julius, killed 2000 of his men, and marched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst \u00e6sernia, which adhered to Rome. L. Scipio and L. Acilius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were in command here, escaped in the disguise of slaves. The enemy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter a considerable time, reduced it by famine. Marius Egnatius captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVenafrum by treachery and slew two Roman cohorts there. Publius Presenteius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeated Perpenna, who had 10,000 men under his command, killed 4000 and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured the arms of the greater part of the others, for which reason the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul Rutilius deprived Perpenna of his command and gave his division of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army to Gaius Marius. Marcus Lamponius destroyed some 800 of the forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder Licinius Crassus and drove the remainder into the town of Grumentum. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gaius Papius captured Nola by treachery and offered to the 2000 Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers in it the privilege of serving under him if they would change their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallegiance. They did so, but as their officers refused the proposal the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter were taken prisoners and starved to death by Papius. In conjunction\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Stabias he captured Minturn\u00e6, and Salernum, which was a Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolony. The prisoners and the slaves from these places were taken into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary service. Then he plundered the entire country around Nuceria. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowns in the vicinity were struck with terror and submitted to him, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the demanded military assistance they furnished him about 10,000 foot and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1000 horse. With these Papius laid siege to Acerr\u00e6. Sextus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, with 10,000 Gallic foot and certain Numidian and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMauretanian horse and foot, advanced toward Acerr\u00e6. Papius took a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Jugurtha, formerly king of Numidia, named Oxynta, who was under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharge of a Roman guard at Venusia, led him out of that place, clothed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin royal purple, and showed him frequently to the Numidians who were in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's army. Many of them deserted, as if to their own king, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat C\u00e6sar was obliged to send the rest back to Africa, as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not trustworthy. Papius attacked him rashly, and had already made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreach in his fortified camp when C\u00e6sar debouched with his horse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the other gates and slew about 6000 of his men, after which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar withdrew from Acerr\u00e6. Canusia and Venusia and many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother towns in Apulia sided with Judacilius. Some that did not submit he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged, and he put to death the principal Roman citizens in them, but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon people and the slaves he enrolled in his army. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The consul Rutilius and Gaius Marius built bridges over the river Liris at no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat distance from each other. Vettius Cato pitched his camp opposite them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut nearer to the bridge of Marius, and placed an ambush by night in some\n\t\t\t\t\t\travines around the bridge of Rutilius. Early in the morning, after he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed Rutilius to cross the bridge, he started up from ambush and killed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge number of the enemy on the dry land and drove many into the river. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis fight Rutilius himself was wounded in the head by a missile and died\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon afterward. Marius was on the other bridge and when he guessed, from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies floating down stream, what had happened, he pushed away those in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfront, crossed the river, and captured the camp of Cato, which was guarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby only a small force, so that Cato was obliged to spend the night where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad won his victory, and to retreat in the morning for want of provisions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe body of Rutilius and those of many other patricians were brought to Rome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor burial. The corpses of the consul and his numerous comrades made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiteous spectacle and the mourning lasted many days. The Senate decreed from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis time on that those who were killed in war should be buried where they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell, lest others should be deterred by the spectacle from entering the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy. When the enemy heard of this they made a similar decree for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves. \n\t\t\t\t"},"6":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There was no successor to Rutilius in the consulship for the remainder of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, as Sextus C\u00e6sar did not have leisure to go to the city and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold the comitia. The Senate appointed G. Marius and Q. C\u00e6pio to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand the forces of Rutilius in the field. The opposing general, Q.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPomp\u00e6dius, fled as a pretended deserter to this C\u00e6pio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe brought with him and gave as a pledge two slave babies, clad with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurple-bordered garments of free-born children, pretending that they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own sons. As further confirmation of his good faith he brought masses of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlead plated with gold and silver. He urged C\u00e6pio to follow him in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall haste with his army and capture the hostile army while destitute of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleader. C\u00e6pio was deceived and followed him. When they had arrived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a place where an ambush had been laid, Pomp\u00e6dius ran up to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttop of a hill as though he were searching for the enemy, and gave his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen a signal. The latter sprang out of their concealment and cut\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6pio and most of his force in pieces. The Senate joined the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof C\u00e6pio's army to that of Marius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Sextus C\u00e6sar was passing through a rocky defile with 30,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot and 5000 horse Marius Egnatius suddenly fell upon him and defeated him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin it. He retreated on a litter, as he was sick, to a certain stream where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was only one bridge, and there he lost the greater part of his force\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the arms of the survivors. He escaped to Teanum with difficulty and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere he armed the remainder of his men as best he could.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRe\u00ebnforcements were sent to him speedily and he marched to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelief of Acerr\u00e6, which was still besieged by Papius, but when\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir camps were pitched opposite each other neither of them dared to attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius defeated the Marsians, who had attacked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. They pursued the enemy vigorously as far as the walls enclosing their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvineyards. The Marsians scaled these walls with loss, but Marius and Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not deem it wise to follow them farther. Cornelius Sulla was encamped on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other side of these enclosures and when he knew what had happened he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame out to meet the Marsians, as they tried to escape, and killed a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber. More than 6000 Marsians were slain that day, and the arms of a still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater number were captured by the Romans. The Marsians were rendered as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurious as wild beasts by this disaster.

They are a very warlike race, and it is said that no\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumph was ever awarded for a victory over them except for this single\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster.

Lafrenius besieged Pompeius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad shut himself up in Firmum. The latter armed his remaining forces, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not come to an engagement. Having learned that another army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching, he sent Sulpicius around to take Lafrenius in the rear while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a sally in front. Battle was joined and both sides were having a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoubtful fight when Sulpicius set fire to the enemy's camp. When the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw this they fled to Asculum in disorder and without a general, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLafrenius had fallen in the battle.

The inhabitants were afraid to do so;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless Judacilius forced his way into the city through the midst of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy with what followers he could get, and upbraided the citizens for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir cowardice and disobedience. As he despaired of saving the city he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst put to death all of his enemies, who had been at variance with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore and who, out of jealousy, had prevented the people from obeying his\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent orders. Then he erected a funeral pile in the temple and placed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouch upon it, and had a feast with his friends, and while the drinking-bout\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas at its height he swallowed poison, threw himself on the pile, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered his friends to set fire to it. Thus perished Judacilius, a man who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered it glorious to die for his country. Sextus C\u00e6sar was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested with the consular power by the Senate after his term of office had\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpired.

The Senate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearing lest they should be surrounded by enemies for want of guards,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarrisoned the sea-coast from Cum\u00e6 to the city with freedmen, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere then for the first time enrolled in the army on account of the scarcity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof soldiers. The Senate also voted that those Italians who had adhered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir alliance should be admitted to citizenship, which was the one thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey all desired most. They sent this decree around among the Etruscans, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladly accepted the citizenship. By this favor the Senate made the faithful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore faithful, confirmed the wavering, and mollified their enemies by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thope of similar treatment. The Romans did not enroll the new citizens in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirty-five existing tribes, lest they should outvote the old ones in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\telections, but incorporated them in ten new tribes, which voted last. So it\n\t\t\t\t\t\toften happened that their vote was useless, since a majority was obtained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the thirty-five tribes that voted first. This fact was either not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticed by the Italians at the time or they were satisfied with what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad gained, but it was observed later and became the source of a new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconflict. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The insurgents along the Adriatic coast, before they learned of the change of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment among the Etruscans, sent 15,000 men to their assistance by a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand difficult road. Gn\u00e6us Pompeius, who was now consul, fell upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and killed 5000 of them. The rest made their way homeward through a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrackless region, in a severe winter, living on acorns; and half of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished. The same winter Porcius Cato, the colleague of Pompeius, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled while fighting with the Marsians. While Sulla was encamped near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeiian mountains Lucius Cluentius pitched his camp in a contemptuous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner at a distance of only three stades from him, Sulla did not tolerate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis insolence, but attacked Cluentius without waiting for his own foragers to come in. He was worsted and put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight, but when he was re\u00ebnforced by his foragers he turned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeated Cluentius. The latter then moved his camp to a greater distance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving received certain Gallic reenforcements he again drew near to Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand just as the two armies were coming to an engagement a Gaul of enormous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize advanced and challenged any Roman to single combat. A Mauritanian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldier of short stature accepted the challenge and killed him, whereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Gauls became panic-stricken and fled. Cluentius' line of battle was thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroken and the remainder of his troops did not stand their ground, but fled,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin disorder to Nola. Sulla followed them and killed 3000 in the pursuit, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the inhabitants of Nola received them by only one gate, lest the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould rush in with them, he killed about 20,000 more outside the walls and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong them Cluentius himself, who fell fighting bravely. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then Sulla moved against the Hirpini and attacked the town of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00c6culanum.

He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstood the trick and gave them one hour, and meanwhile piled fagots\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround their walls, which were made of wood, and at the expiration of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thour set them on fire. They were terrified and surrendered the town. Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplundered it because it had not been delivered up voluntarily but by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity. He spared the other towns that gave themselves up, and in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway the entire population of the Hirpini was brought under subjection. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla moved against the Samnites, not where Mutilus, the Samnite general,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguarded the roads, but by another circuitous route where his coming was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. He fell upon them suddenly, killed many, and scattered the rest in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisorderly flight. Mutilus was wounded and took refuge with a few followers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin \u00c6sernia. Sulla destroyed his camp and moved against Bovianum,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the common council of the rebels was held. The city had three towers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the inhabitants were looking at Sulla from one of these he ordered a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetachment to capture whichever of the others they could, and to make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignal by means of smoke. When the smoke was seen he made an attack in front\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, after a severe fight of three hours, took the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese were the successes of Sulla during that summer. When winter came he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to Rome to solicit the consulship. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gn\u00e6us Pompeius brought the Marsians, the Marrucini, and the Vestini\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder subjection. Gaius Cosconius, another Roman pr\u00e6tor, advanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst and burned Salapia. He received the surrender of Cann\u00e6 and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid siege to Canusium. He had a severe fight with the Samnites, who came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits relief. After great slaughter on both sides Cosconius was beaten and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretreated to Cann\u00e6. A river separated the two armies, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrebatius sent word to Cosconius either to come over to his side and fight\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, or to withdraw and let him cross. Cosconius withdrew, and while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrebatius was crossing attacked him and got the better of him, and, while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas flying toward the stream, killed 15,000 of his men. The remainder took\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefuge with Trebatius in Canusium. Cosconius overran the territory of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLarinum, Venusia, and Asculum, and invaded that of the P\u0153diculi,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand within two days received their surrender. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6cilius Metellus, his successor in the pr\u00e6torship, attacked the Apulians and overcame them in battle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPomp\u00e6dius, one of the rebel generals, here lost his life. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvivors joined Metellus separately. Such was the course of events\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthroughout Italy as regards the Social War, which had raged with violence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus far and until the whole of Italy came into the Roman state except the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucanians and the Samnites. These also seem to have obtained what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesired somewhat later. They were each enrolled in tribes of their own, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who had been admitted to citizenship before, so that they might not,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby being mingled with the old citizens, vote them down in the elections by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce of numbers. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About the same time dissensions arose in the city between debtors and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreditors, since the latter exacted the money due them with interest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough an old law distinctly forbade lending on interest and imposed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpenalty upon any one doing so. It seems that the ancient Romans, like the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreeks, abhorred the taking of interest on loans as something knavish, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thard on the poor, and leading to contention and enmity; and by the same kind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof reasoning the Persians considered lending itself as having a tendency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to deceit and lying. But, since time had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsanctioned the practice of taking interest, the creditors demanded it\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to custom. The debtors, on the other hand, put off the payment by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcausing war and civil commotion. Some indeed threatened to visit the legal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpenalty on the interest-takers. The pr\u00e6tor Asellio, who had charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these matters, as he was not able to compose their differences by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuasion, allowed them to proceed against each other in the courts, thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing the conflict of law and custom before the judges. The lenders,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texasperated that the old law should be revived, killed the pr\u00e6tor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the following manner. He was offering sacrifice to Castor and Pollux in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forum, with a crowd standing around as was usual at such a ceremony. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first place somebody threw a stone at him. He dropped the libation-bowl\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ran toward the temple of Vesta. They got ahead of him and prevented him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom reaching the temple, and after he had fled into a certain tavern they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcut his throat. Many of his pursuers, thinking that he had taken refuge with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Vestal virgins, ran in there, where it was not lawful for men to go.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThus was Asellio, while serving as pr\u00e6tor, and pouring out the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibation, and wearing the sacred gilded vestments customary in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tceremonies, slain at the second hour of the day, in the midst of the forum,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the side of the sacrificial offerings. The Senate offered a reward of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney to any free person, and freedom to any slave, and impunity to any\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplice, who should give testimony leading to the conviction of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers of Asellio, but nobody gave any information. The money-lenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcovered up everything. \n\t\t\t\t"},"7":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Hitherto the murders and seditions had been merely intestine squabbles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfterward the chiefs of factions assailed each other with great armies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the usage of war, and the country lay as a prize between them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe beginning and origin of these contentions came about directly after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocial War, in this wise. When Mithridates, king of Pontus and of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnations, invaded Bithynia and Phrygia and that part of Asia adjacent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose countries, as I have related in the preceding book, the consul Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas chosen by lot to the command of Asia and the Mithridatic war, but was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill in Rome. Marius thought that this would be an easy and lucrative war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he desired the command of it. So he prevailed upon the tribune, Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulpicius, by many promises, to help him obtain it. He also led the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian citizens, who had very little power in the elections, to hope that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should be distributed among all the tribes--not putting forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything concerning his own advantage, but with the expectation of employing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem as loyal servants in his every attempt. Sulpicius straightway brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward a law for this purpose. If it were enacted Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Sulpicius would have everything they wanted, because the new citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar outnumbered the old ones. The old citizens saw this and opposed the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones with all their might. They fought each other with sticks and stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the evil increased continually. The consuls, becoming apprehensive, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe day for voting on the law drew near, proclaimed a vacation of many days'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduration, such as was customary on festal occasions, in order to postpone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe voting and the danger. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulpicius would not wait for the vacation's end. He ordered his faction to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome to the forum with concealed daggers and to do whatever the exigency\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight require, and not to spare the consuls themselves upon occasion. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything was in readiness he denounced the vacation as illegal and ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls, Cornelius Sulla and Quintus Pompeius, to put an end to it at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce, in order to proceed to the enactment of laws. A tumult arose, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who had been armed drew their daggers and threatened to kill the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, who were making opposition. Finally Pompeius escaped secretly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla withdrew on the pretext of taking advice. In the meantime the son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, who was the son-in-law of Sulla, and who was speaking his mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather freely, was killed by the Sulpicians. Presently Sulla returned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannulled the vacation, but hurried away to Capua, where his army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed, in order to cross over to Asia to take command of the war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates, for he knew nothing as yet of the designs against himself. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vacation was annulled and Sulla had left the city, Sulpicius enacted his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw, and Marius, for whose sake it was done, was forthwith chosen commander\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the war against Mithridates in place of Sulla. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Sulla heard of this he resolved to decide the question by war. He called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army together in a conference. They were eager for the war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates because it promised much plunder, and they feared that Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould enlist other soldiers instead of themselves. Sulla spoke of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindignity put upon him by Sulpicius and Marius, and while he did not openly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallude to anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention this kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta war), he urged them to be ready to obey his orders. They understood what\n\t\t\t\t\t\the meant, and as they feared lest they should miss the campaign they spoke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldly what Sulla had in his mind, and told him to be of good courage, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lead them to Rome. Sulla was overjoyed and led six legions thither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthwith, but all of his superior officers, except one qu\u00e6stor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft him and hastened to the city, because they would not submit to the idea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof leading an army against their country. Envoys met him on the road and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked him why he was marching with armed forces against his country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\" To deliver her from her tyrants,\" he replied. He gave the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer to a second and a third embassy that came to him, one after another,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut he announced to them finally that the Senate and Marius and Sulpicius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight meet him in the Campus Martius if they liked, and that he would do\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhatever might be agreed upon after consultation. As he was approaching, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague, Pompeius, came to meet him and praised him for what he had done,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Pompeius was delighted, and co\u00f6perated with him in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs Marius and Sulpicius needed some short interval for preparation, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent other messengers, in the guise of envoys from the Senate, directing him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to move his camp nearer than forty stades from the city until they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider of the business in hand. Sulla and Pompeius understood their game\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperfectly and promised to comply, but as soon as the envoys were returning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey followed them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulla took possession of the C\u0153lian gate and of the adjoining wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith one legion of soldiers, and Pompeius occupied the Colline gate with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother. A third advanced to the Sublician bridge, and a fourth remained on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard in front of the walls. With the remainder Sulla entered the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in appearance and in fact an enemy. The inhabitants round about tried\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fight him off by hurling missiles from the roofs until he threatened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburn the houses; then they desisted. Marius and Sulpicius went, with some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces they had hastily armed, to meet the invaders near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00c6squiline forum, and here a battle took place between the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontending parties, the first that was regularly fought in Rome with trumpet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand signal under the rules of war, and not at all in the similitude of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaction fight. To such extremity of evil had the recklessness of party\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrife progressed among them. Sulla's forces were beginning to waver when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla seized a standard and exposed himself to danger in the foremost ranks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOut of regard for their general and fear of ignominy if they should abandon\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir standard, they rallied at once. Sulla ordered up fresh troops from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp and sent others around by the socalled Suburran road to take the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the rear. The Marians fought feebly against these new-comers, and as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared lest they should be surrounded they called to their aid the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens who were still fighting from the houses, and proclaimed freedom to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves who would share their labors. As nobody came forward they fell into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutter despair and fled at once out of the city, together with those of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobility who had co\u00f6perated with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulla advanced to the so-called Via Sacra and there, in sight of everybody,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunished certain soldiers who had plundered persons on the road. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed guards at intervals throughout the city, he and Pompeius keeping\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatch by night. Each kept moving about his own command to see that no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalamity was brought about either by the frightened people or by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictorious troops: They summoned the people to an assembly at daybreak and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamented the condition of the republic, which had been so long given over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemagogues, and said that they had done what they had done as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity. They proposed that no question should ever again be brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the people which had not been previously considered by the Senate, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancient practice which had been abandoned long ago. Also that the voting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not be by tribes, but by centuries, as King Servius Tullius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordained. They thought that by these two measures--namely, that no law\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be brought before the people unless it had been previously before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and that the voting should be controlled by the well-to-do and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsober-minded rather than by the pauper and reckless classes--there would no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger be any starting-point for civil discord. They proposed many other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures for curtailing the power of the tribunes, which had become\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremely tyrannical. They enrolled 300 of the best citizens at once in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlist of senators, who had been reduced at that time to a very small number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had fallen into contempt for that reason. They annulled all the acts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed by Sulpicius after the vacation had been proclaimed by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, as being illegal. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus the seditions proceeded from strife and contention to murder, and from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurder to open war, and now the first army of her own citizens had invaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome as a hostile country. From this time the civil\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissensions were decided only by the arbitrament of arms. There were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequent attacks upon the city and battles before the walls and other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalamities incident to war. Henceforth there was no restraint upon violence\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither from the sense of shame, or regard for law, institutions, or country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Sulpicius, who still held the office of tribune, together with Marius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had been consul six times, and his son Marius, also Publius Cethegus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJunius Brutus, Gn\u00e6us and Quintus Granius, Publius Albinovanus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus L\u00e6torius, and others with them, about twelve in number,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfled from Rome, because they had stirred up the sedition, had borne arms\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the consuls, had incited slaves to insurrection, had been voted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies of the Roman people, and anybody meeting them had been authorized to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkill them with impunity or to drag them before the consuls, and their goods\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been confiscated. Detectives were in pursuit of these men. They caught\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulpicius and killed him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Marius escaped them and fled to Minturn\u00e6 without a companion or a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservant. While he was resting in a secluded house the magistrates of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, whose fears were excited by the proclamation of the Roman people, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho hesitated to be the murderers of a man who had been six times consul and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad performed so many brilliant exploits, sent a Gaul who was living there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto kill him with a sword. It is said that as the Gaul was approaching the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpallet of Marius in the dusk he thought he saw the gleam and flash of fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdarting from his eyes, and that Marius rose from his bed and shouted to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a thundering voice, \"Do you dare to kill Gaius Marius? \" The Gaul turned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand fled out of doors like a madman, exclaiming, \"I cannot kill Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius.\" As the magistrates had come to their previous decision with\n\t\t\t\t\t\treluctance, so now a kind of religious awe came over them as they remembered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prophecy uttered while he was a boy, that he should be consul seven\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes. It was said that while he was a boy seven young eaglets alighted on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this breast, and that the soothsayers predicted that he would attain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighest office seven times. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Bearing these things in mind and believing that the Gaul had been inspired\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith fear by divine influence, the magistrates of Minturn\u00e6 sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius out of the town forthwith, to seek safety wherever he could. As he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknew that Sulla was searching for him and that horsemen were pursuing him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the moved toward the sea by unfrequented roads and came to a hut where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trested, covering himself up with leaves. Hearing a noise, he concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself more carefully with the leaves. Hearing a somewhat louder noise, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trushed to the boat of an old fisherman, overpowered him, leaped into it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, although a storm was raging, he cut the rope, spread the sail, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitted himself to chance. He was driven to an island where he found a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tship navigated by his own friends, and sailed thence to Africa. He was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprohibited from landing there by the governor, Sextius, because he was an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, and he passed the winter in his ship a little beyond the province of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, along the shore of Numidia. While he was sailing thither he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined by Cethegus, Granius, Albinovanus, L\u00e6torius, and others,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the son of Marius himself, who had gained tidings of his approach.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey had fled from Rome to Hiempsal, prince of Numidia, and now they had run\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway from him, fearing lest they should be delivered up. They were ready to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo just as Sulla had done, that is, to master their country by force, but as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had no army they waited for some opportunity. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Rome Sulla, who had been the first one to seize the city by force of arms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was now able perhaps to wield supreme power, having rid himself of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, desisted from violence of his own accord. He sent his army forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Capua and resumed his functions as consul. The faction under banishment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially the rich ones, and many wealthy women, who now found a respite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the terror of arms, bestirred themselves for the return of their male\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatives from exile. They spared neither pains nor expense to this end,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven conspiring against the persons of the consuls when they thought they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould not secure the recall of their friends while the consuls survived.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla's army furnished ample protection for himself even after he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcease to be consul, since he had been voted commander of the war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates. The people commiserated the fears of the other consul, Quintus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, for his personal safety, and gave him the command of Italy and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army appertaining to it, which was then under Gn\u00e6us Pompeius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen the latter learned this fact he was greatly displeased.

After the guilty ones had fled,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGn\u00e6us came to the camp in a high state of indignation over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilling of a consul contrary to law.

He did not remain long in the city, but went to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army at Capua and from thence to Asia. The friends of the exiles,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged by Cinna, Sulla's successor in the consulship, excited the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens in favor of the scheme of Marius, that they should be distributed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the old tribes, so that they should not be powerless by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoting last. This was preliminary to the recall of Marius and his friends.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the old citizens resisted with all their might, Cinna\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated with the new ones. It was supposed that he had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbribed with 300 talents to do this. The other consul, Octavius, sided with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe old citizens. The partisans of Cinna took possession of the forum with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed daggers, and with loud cries demanded that they should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistributed among all the tribes. The more reputable part of the plebeians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadhered to Octavius, and they also carried daggers. While Octavius was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat home awaiting the result, the news was brought to him that the majority\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the tribunes had vetoed the proposed action, but that the new citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad started a riot, drawn their daggers on the street, and assaulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposing tribunes on the rostra. When Octavius heard this he ran down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the Via Sacra with a very dense mass of men, burst into the forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike a torrent, pushed through the midst of the crowd, and separated them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe struck terror into them, pushed on to the temple of Castor and Pollux,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand drove Cinna away. His companions fell upon the new citizens without\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders, killed many of them, put the rest to flight, and pursued them to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity gates. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cinna, who had been emboldened by the numbers of the new citizens to think\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he should conquer, seeing the victory won contrary to his expectation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the bravery of the few, ran through the city calling the slaves to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance by an offer of freedom. As none responded he hastened to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowns near by, which had lately been admitted to Roman citizenship, Tibur,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPr\u00e6neste, and the rest as far as Nola, inciting them all to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevolution and collecting money for the purposes of war. While Cinna was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking these preparations and plans, certain senators of his party joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, among them Gaius Milo, Quintus Sertorius, and Gaius Marius the younger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Senate decreed that since Cinna had left the city in danger while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholding the office of consul, and had offered freedom to the slaves, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould no longer be consul, or even a citizen, and elected in his stead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius Merula, the priest of Jupiter ( flamen Dialis ). It\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis said that this priest alone wore the flamen's cap at all times, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers wearing it only during sacrifices. Cinna proceeded to Capua, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was another Roman army, the officers of which, and the senators who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere present, he courted. He went to meet them as consul in an assembly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he laid down the fasces as though he were a private citizen, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshedding tears, said, \"From you, citizens, I received this authority. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople voted it to me; the Senate has taken it away from me without your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsent. Although I am the sufferer by this wrong I grieve amid my own\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroubles equally for your sakes. What need is there that we should solicit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe favor of the tribes in the elections hereafter? What need have we of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou? Where will be your power in the assemblies, in the elections, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoice of consuls? If you do not confirm what you bestow, you will be robbed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhenever you give your decision.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t He said this to stir them up, and after exciting much pity for himself he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trent his garments, leaped down from the rostra, and threw himself on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground before them, where he lay a long time. With tears in their eyes they\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised him up; they restored him to the curule chair; they lifted up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfasces and bade him be of good cheer, as he was consul still, and lead them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever he would. At their instance the officers came forward and took the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary oath to support Cinna, and administered it each to the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder him. When he had been confirmed in this way he traversed the allied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities and stirred them up also, because it was on their account chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this misfortune had happened to him. They furnished him both money and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers; and many others, even of the aristocratic party in Rome, to whom a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable form of government was irksome, came and joined him. While Cinna was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus occupied, the consuls, Octavius and Merula, fortified the city with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrenches, repaired the walls, and planted engines on them. To raise an army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey sent around to the towns that were still faithful and also to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighboring Gauls. They also summoned Gn\u00e6us Pompeius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproconsul who commanded the army on the Adriatic, to come in haste to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taid of his country. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius came and encamped before the Colline gate. Cinna advanced against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim and encamped near him. When Gaius Marius heard of these transactions he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed to Etruria with his fellow-exiles and about 500 slaves who had joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir masters from Rome. Filthy and longhaired, he marched through the towns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresenting a pitiable appearance, descanting on his battles, his victories\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the Cimbri, and his six consulships; and what was extremely pleasing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, promising, and also seeming, to be faithful to their interests in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter of the voting. In this way he collected 6000 Etruscans and joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna, who received him gladly by reason of their common interest in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent enterprise. After their armies were joined they encamped on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks of the Tiber and divided their forces in three parts: Cinna and Carbo\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite the city, Sertorius above it, and Marius toward the sea. The two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter threw bridges across the river in order to cut off the city's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfood-supply. Marius captured Ostia and plundered it. Cinna sent a force and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured Ariminum in order to prevent an army coming to the city from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject Gauls. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The consuls were alarmed. They needed more troops, but they were unable to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcall Sulla because he had already crossed over to Asia. They ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6cilius Metellus, who was carrying on the remainder of the Social\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWar against the Samnites, to make peace on the best terms he could, and come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the rescue of his beleaguered country. Metellus would not agree to what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Samnites demanded, and when Marius heard of this he made an engagement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith them to grant all that they asked from Metellus. In this way the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites became allies of Marius. Appius Claudius, a military tribune, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad command of the defences of Rome at the hill called the Janiculum, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce received a favor from Marius which the latter now reminded him of, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of which he admitted him into the city, opening a gate for him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat about daybreak. Then Marius admitted Cinna. They were thrust out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Pompeius, who attacked them together, but a severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthunder-storm broke upon the camp of Pompeius, and he was killed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlightning together with others of the nobility. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After Marius had stopped the passage of food-supplies from the sea, or by way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the river above, he hastened to attack the neighboring towns where grain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas stored for the Romans. He fell upon their garrisons unexpectedly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured Antium, Aricia, Lanuvium, and others. There were some also that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere delivered up to him by treachery. Having cut off their supplies by land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this manner, he advanced boldly against Rome, by the so-called Appian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWay, before any other supplies were brought to them by another route. He and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna, and their lieutenant-generals, Carbo and Sertorius, halted at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance of 100 stades from the city and went into camp. Octavius, Crassus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Metellus had taken position against them at the Alban Mount, where they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved the enemy's movements. Although they considered themselves superior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin bravery and numbers, they hesitated to risk hastily their country's fate\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the hazard of a single battle. Cinna sent heralds around the city to\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffer freedom to slaves who would desert to him, and forthwith a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber did desert. The Senate was alarmed. Anticipating the most serious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences from the people if the scarcity of corn should be protracted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit changed its mind and sent envoys to Cinna to treat for peace. The latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked them whether they had come to see him as a consul or as a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen. They were at a loss for an answer and went back to the city; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow a large number of freemen flocked to Cinna, some from fear of famine and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers because they had been previously favorable to his party and had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaiting to see which way the scales would turn. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Cinna began to despise his enemies and drew near to the wall, halting at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe distance of a stone's throw, where he encamped. Octavius and his party\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere undecided and fearful, and hesitated to attack him on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesertions and the negotiations. The Senate was greatly perplexed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered it a dreadful thing to depose Lucius Merula, the priest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJupiter, who had been chosen consul in place of Cinna, and who had done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing wrong in his office. Yet on account of the impending danger it\n\t\t\t\t\t\treluctantly sent envoys to Cinna again, and this time as consul. They no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger expected favorable terms, so they only asked that Cinna should swear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them that he would abstain from bloodshed. He refused to take the oath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut he promised nevertheless that he would not willingly be the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody's death. He directed, however, that Octavius, who had gone around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand entered the city by another gate, should keep away from the forum lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything should befall him against Cinna's will. This answer he delivered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe envoys from a high platform in his character as consul. Marius stood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeside the curule chair silent, but showed by the asperity of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountenance how much murder he would commit. When the Senate had accepted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese terms and had invited Cinna and Marius to enter (for it was understood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat all the things that Cinna had subscribed to were the doings of Marius),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter said with a scornful smile that it was not lawful for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanished to enter. Forthwith the tribunes voted to repeal the decree of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanishment against him and all the others who were expelled under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship of Sulla. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly Cinna and Marius entered the city and everybody received them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith fear. Straightway they began to plunder without restraint the goods of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were supposed to be of the opposite party. Cinna and Marius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsworn to Octavius, and the augurs and soothsayers had predicted, that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould suffer no harm, yet his friends advised him to fly. He replied that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould never desert the city while he was consul. So he withdrew from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum to the Janiculum with the nobility and what was left of his army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he occupied the curule chair and wore his robes of office, attended by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlictors as a consul. Here he was attacked by Censorinus with a body of\n\t\t\t\t\t\thorse, and again his friends and the soldiers who stood by him urged him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfly and brought him a horse, but he disdained even to arise, and awaited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Censorinus cut off his head and carried it to Cinna, and it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspended in the forum in front of the rostra, the first head of a consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was so exposed. After him the heads of others who were slain were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspended there. This shocking custom, which began with Octavius, was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscontinued, but was handed down to subsequent intestine massacres. Now the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictors sent out spies to search for their enemies of the senatorial and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequestrian orders. After the knights were killed no further attention was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid to them, but all the heads of senators were exposed in front of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trostra. Neither reverence for the gods, nor the indignation of men, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of odium for their acts existed any longer among them. After committing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsavage deeds they turned to hideous sights. They killed remorselessly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevered the necks of men already dead, and they paraded these horrors before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe public eye, either to inspire fear and terror, or for a monstrous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspectacle. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gaius Julius and Lucius Julius, two brothers, Atilius Serranus, Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLentulus, Gaius Numatorius, and Marcus B\u00e6bius were arrested in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreet and killed. Crassus was pursued with his son. He anticipated the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuers by killing his son, but was himself killed by them. Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntonius, the orator, fled to a certain country place, where he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed and entertained by the farmer, who sent his slave to a tavern for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine of a better quality than he was in the habit of buying. The innkeeper\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked him why he wanted the better quality. The slave whispered the reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him, bought the wine, and went back. The seller ran and told Marius. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius heard this he sprang up with joy as though he would rush to do the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeed himself, but he was restrained by his friends. A tribune was despatched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the house, who sent some soldiers upstairs, whom Antonius, a delightful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaker, entertained with a long discourse. He moved their pity by\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecounting many and various things, until the tribune, who was at a loss to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow what had happened, rushed into the house and, finding his soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlistening to Antonius, killed him while he was still addressing them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent his head to Marius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cornutus concealed himself in a hut and was saved by his slaves in an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingenious way.

In this way he was saved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby his slaves. Quintus Ancharius watched his opportunity till Marius was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to offer sacrifice in the Capitol, hoping that the temple would be a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore propitious place for him. But when he approached and saluted Marius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter, who was just beginning the sacrifice, ordered the guards to kill\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the Capitol forthwith; and his head, with that of the orator\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntonius, and those of others who had been consuls and pr\u00e6tors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas exposed in the forum. Burial was not permitted to any of the slain. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies of such men as these were torn in pieces by birds and dogs.

There were banishments, and confiscations of property, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepositions from office, and a repeal of the laws enacted during Sulla's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship. All of Sulla's friends were put to death, his house was razed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ground, his property confiscated, and himself voted a public enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch was made for his wife and children, but they escaped.

Accusation was also brought against Lutatius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCatulus, who had been the colleague of Marius in the war against the Cimbri,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand whose life Marius once saved. It was charged that he had been very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tungrateful to Marius and was bitter against him when he was banished. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen were put under secret surveillance, and when the day for holding court\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrived were summoned to trial (the proper way was to put the accused under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrest after they had been cited four times at certain fixed intervals), but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMerula had opened his own veins, and a tablet lying at his side showed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he cut his veins he had removed his flamen's cap, for it was accounted\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sin for the priest to wear it at his death. Catulus suffocated himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith burning charcoal in a chamber newly plastered and still moist. So these\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo men perished. The slaves who had joined Cinna in answer to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclamation and had thereupon been freed and were at this time enrolled in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army by Cinna himself, broke into and plundered houses, and killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons whom they met on the street. Some of them attacked their own masters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly. After Cinna had forbidden this several times, but without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavail, he surrounded them with his Gallic soldiery one night while they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking their rest, and killed them all.

He would be there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresently to take vengeance, for them and for the entire city, upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguilty ones. He assured the other citizens, and the new citizens, that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade no complaint against them. When the contents of the letters became\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknown fear fell upon all, and they began sending messengers to reconcile him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his enemies and to tell him in advance that if he wanted any security\n\t\t\t\t\t\the should write to the Senate at once. They ordered Cinna and Carbo to cease\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecruiting soldiers until Sulla's answer should be received. They promised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto do so, but as soon as the messengers had gone they proclaimed themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls for the ensuing year so that they need not come back to the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly to hold the election. They traversed Italy, collecting soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom they carried across by detachments on shipboard to Liburnia, as they expected to meet Sulla there. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The first detachment had a prosperous voyage. The next one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencountered a storm and those who reached land went home immediately, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey did not relish the prospect of fighting their fellow-citizens. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest learned this they refused to cross to Liburnia. Cinna was angry and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled them to an assembly in order to coerce them. They, angry also and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready to defend themselves, assembled. One of the lictors, who was clearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe road for Cinna, struck somebody who was in the way and one of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers struck the lictor. Cinna ordered the arrest of the offender,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon a clamor rose on all sides, stones were thrown at him, and those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were near him drew their swords and stabbed him. So Cinna also perished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring his consulship. Carbo recalled those who had been sent over by ship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Liburnia. As he was solicitous about the present state of things, he did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot go back to the city, although the tribunes summoned him with urgency to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold an election for the choice of a colleague. When they threatened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduce him to the rank of a private citizen he came back and ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholding of the consular election, but as the omens were unfavorable he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostponed it to another day. When that day came lightning struck the temples\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Luna and of Ceres; so the augurs prorogued the comitia beyond the summer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolstice, and Carbo remained the sole consul. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulla answered those who came to him from the Senate, saying that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever be on friendly terms with the men who had committed such crimes. Still\n\t\t\t\t\t\the would not prevent the city from extending clemency to them. As for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurity he said that, as he had a devoted army, he could better furnish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlasting security to them, and to those who had fled to his camp, than they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him; whereby it was made plain in a single sentence that he would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisband his army, but was contemplating the exercise of supreme power. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemanded of them his former dignity, his property, and the sacerdotal\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice, and that they should restore to him in full measure whatever other\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors he had previously held. He sent some of his own men with the Senate's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessengers to confer about these matters. As soon as they learned from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusians that Cinna was dead and that Rome was in an unsettled state,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey went back to Sulla without transacting their business. He started with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive legions of Italian troops and 6000 horse, to whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\the added some other forces from the Peloponnesus and Macedonia, in all about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t40,000 men. He led them from the Pir\u00e6us to Patr\u00e6, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen sailed from Patr\u00e6 to Brundusium in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1600 ships. The Brundusians received him without a fight, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich favor he afterward gave them exemption from customs-duties, which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoy to this day. Then he put his army in motion and went forward. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t He was met on the road by C\u00e6cilius Metellus Pius, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen some time before to finish up the Social War, but who did not return\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the. city for fear of Cinna and Marius. He had been awaiting the turn of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents in Liguria, and now offered himself as a volunteer ally with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce under his command, as he was still a proconsul; for those who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen chosen to this office retain it till they come back to Rome. After\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus, came Pompey, who not long afterward was surnamed the Great, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pompeius who was killed by lightning and who was supposed to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfriendly to Sulla. The son removed this suspicion by coming with a legion\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he had collected from the territory of Picenum on the reputation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this father, who had been very influential there. A little later he recruited\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo more legions and became Sulla's most useful right-hand man in these\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffairs. So Sulla held him in honor, though still very young; and they say\n\t\t\t\t\t\the rose at the entrance of none other than this youth. After the war was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinished Sulla sent him to Africa to drive out the party of Carbo and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestore Hiempsal (who had been expelled by the Numidians) to his kingdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor this service Sulla allowed him a triumph over the Numidians, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas under age, and was still in the equestrian order. He took his start to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatness from this beginning, and was sent against Sertorius in Spain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater against Mithridates in Pontus. Cethegus also joined Sulla, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Cinna and Marius he had been violently hostile to him and had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven out of the city with them. He was now a suppliant, and offered his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices to Sulla in any capacity he might desire. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulla now had plenty of soldiers and a sufficient number of friends of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher orders, whom he used as lieutenants. He and Metellus, who were both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproconsuls, marched in advance, for it seems that Sulla, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed proconsul against Mithridates, had at no time laid down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand, although he had been voted a public enemy at the instance of Cinna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Sulla moved against his enemies with a most intense yet concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred. The people in the city, who had formed a pretty fair judgment of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter of the man, and who remembered his former attack and capture of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city, and who took into account the decrees they had proclaimed against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and who had witnessed the destruction of his house, the confiscation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this property, the killing of his friends, and the narrow escape of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamily, were in a state of terror. Conceiving that there was no middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground between victory and utter destruction, they united with the consuls\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto resist Sulla, but with trepidation. They despatched messengers throughout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly to collect soldiers, provisions, and money, and, as in cases of\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme peril, they omitted nothing that zeal and earnestness could suggest. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gaius Norbanus and Lucius Scipio, who were then the consuls, and with them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbo, who had been consul the previous year (all of them moved by equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred of Sulla and more fearful than others because they knew that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere more to blame for what had been done), levied the best possible army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the city, obtained an additional one from Italy, and marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla in detachments. They had 200 cohorts of 500 men each at first, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir forces were considerably augmented afterward. The sympathies of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were much in favor of the consuls, because the action of Sulla, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas marching against his country, seemed to be that of an enemy, while that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the consuls, even if they were working for themselves, was ostensibly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause of the republic. Many persons, too, who knew that they had shared the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguilt of the consuls, and who were believed to share their fears,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated with them. They knew very well that Sulla was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeditating merely prevention, correction, and alarm for them, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, death, confiscation, and complete extermination. In this they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not mistaken, for the war ruined everything. From 10,000 to 20,000 men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere slain in a single battle more than once. Fifty thousand on both sides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost their lives around the city, and to the survivors Sulla was unsparing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin severity, both to individuals and to communities, until, finally, he made\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself the undisputed master of the whole Roman government, so far as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twished or cared to be. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems, too, that divine Providence foretold to them the results of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar. Sights terrible and unexpected were observed by many, both in public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in private, throughout all Italy. Ancient, awe-inspiring oracles were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremembered. Many monstrous things happened. A mule gave birth to a colt. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpregnant woman was delivered of a viper instead of a baby. There was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere earthquake divinely sent and some of the temples in Rome were thrown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown (the Romans gave altogether too much attention to such things). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, that had been built by the kings 400 years before, burned down, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobody could discover the cause of the fire. All things seemed to point to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccession of slaughters, to the conquest of Italy and of the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, to the capture of the city, and a change in the form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This war began as soon as Sulla arrived at Brundusium, which was in the 174th\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOlympiad. Considering the magnitude of the work accomplished, its length was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot great, compared with such wars in general, since the combatants rushed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon each other with the fury of private enemies. For this reason greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more distressing calamities than usual befell the eager participants in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta short space of time. Nevertheless the war lasted three years in Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone, until Sulla had secured the supreme power, but in Spain it continued\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven after Sulla's death. Battles, skirmishes, sieges, and fighting of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinds were numerous throughout Italy, both regular engagements under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals and by detachments, and all were noteworthy. The greatest and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremarkable of them I shall mention in this book. First of all Sulla and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus fought a battle against Norbanus at Canusium and killed 6000 of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, while Sulla's loss was seventy, but many of his men were wounded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorbanus retreated to Capua. \n\t\t\t\t"},"10":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Sulla and Metellus were near Teanum, L. Scipio advanced against them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith another army which was very downhearted and longed for peace. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSullan faction knew this and sent envoys to Scipio to negotiate, not because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey hoped or desired to come to an agreement, but because they expected to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreate dissensions in Scipio's army, which was in a state of dejection. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis they succeeded. Scipio took hostages for the armistice and marched down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the plain. Only three from each side came to the conference, hence what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed between them is not known. It seems that during the armistice Scipio\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent Sertorius to his colleague, Norbanus, to communicate with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning the negotiation and that there was a cessation of hostilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile they were waiting for an answer. Sertorius on his way took possession\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Suessa, which had espoused the side of Sulla, and Sulla made complaint of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis to Scipio. The latter, either because he was privy to the affair or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he did not know what answer to make concerning the strange act of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius, sent back Sulla's hostages. His army blamed the consuls for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunjustifiable seizure of Suessa during the armistice and for the surrender\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the hostages, who were not demanded back, and made a secret agreement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Sulla to go over to him if he would draw nearer. This he did and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraightway they all went over en masse, so that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul, Scipio, and his son Lucius, alone of the whole army, were left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnonplussed in their tent, where they were captured by Sulla. That Scipio was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot aware of a conspiracy of this kind, embracing his whole army, seems to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme inexcusable in a general. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Sulla was unable to induce Scipio to change, he sent him away with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson unharmed. He also sent other envoys to Norbanus at Capua to open\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnegotiations, either because he was apprehensive of the result (since the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater part of Italy still adhered to the consuls), or in order to play the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame game on him that he had played on Scipio. As nobody came back and no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer was returned (for it seems that Norbanus feared lest he should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccused by his army in the same way that Scipio had been), Sulla again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced, devastating all hostile territory. Norbanus did the same thing on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother roads. Carbo hastened to the city and caused Metellus, and all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother senators who had joined Sulla, to be decreed public enemies. It was at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis time that the Capitol was burned. Some attributed this deed to Carbo,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers to the consuls, others to somebody sent by Sulla. It was a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmystery; nor am I able now to conjecture what caused the fire. Sertorius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had been some time previously chosen pr\u00e6tor for Spain, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe taking of Suessa fled to his provincet and as the former\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tors refused to recognize his authority, he stirred up a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal of trouble for the Romans there. In the meantime the forces of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls were constantly increasing from the major part of. Italy, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill adhered to them, and also from the neighboring Gauls on the Po. Nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas Sulla idle. He sent messengers to all parts of Italy that he could\n\t\t\t\t\t\treach, to collect troops by friendship, by fear, by money, and by promises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this way the remainder of the summer was consumed on both sides. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The consuls for the following year were Papirius Carbo again and Marius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnephew of the great Marius, then twenty-seven years of age. At first the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter and severe frost kept the combatants apart. At the beginning of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspring, on the banks of the river \u00c6sis, there was a severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement lasting from early morning till noon between Metellus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarinas, Carbo's lieutenant. Carinas was put to flight after heavy loss,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon all the country thereabout seceded from the consuls to Metellus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbo came up with Metellus and besieged him until he heard that Marius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother consul, had been defeated in a great battle near Pr\u00e6neste,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he led his forces back to Ariminum. Pompey hung on his rear doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage. The defeat at Pr\u00e6neste was in this wise. Sulla captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe town of Setia. Marius, who was encamped near\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby, drew a little farther away. When he arrived at the so-called sacred lake\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Sacriportus) he gave battle and fought bravely. When his left wing began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive way five cohorts of foot and two of horse decided not to wait for open\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeat, but lowered their standards together and went over to Sulla. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the beginning of a terrible disaster to Marius. His shattered army fled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pr\u00e6neste with Sulla in hot pursuit. The Pr\u00e6estians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave shelter to those who arrived first, but when Sulla pressed upon them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe gates were closed, and Marius was hauled up by ropes. There was another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat slaughter around the walls by reason of the closing of the gates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla captured a large number of prisoners. All the Samnites among them he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled, because they were always ill-affected toward the Romans. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About the same time Metellus gained a victory over the other army of Carbo,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand here again five cohorts, for safety's sake, deserted to Metellus during\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe battle. Pompey overcame Marcius near Sen\u00e6 and plundered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttown. Sulla, having shut Marius up in Pr\u00e6neste, drew a line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumvallation around the town a considerable distance from it and left the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork in charge of Lucretius Ofella, as he intended to reduce Marius by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine, not by fighting. When Marius saw that his condition was hopeless he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastened to put his private enemies out of the way. He wrote to Brutus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity pr\u00e6tor, to call the Senate together on some pretext or other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to kill Publius Antistius, the other Papirius, Lucius Domitius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMucius Sc\u00e6vola, the pontifex maximus. Of these the two first were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain in their seats as Marius had ordered, assassins having been introduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the senate-house for this purpose. Domitius ran out, but was killed at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe door, and Sc\u00e6vola was killed a little farther away. Their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies were thrown into the Tiber, for it was now the custom not to bury the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain. Sulla sent an army to Rome in detachments by different roads with\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders to seize the gates, and if they were repulsed to rendezvous at Ostia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe towns on the way received them with fear and trembling, and the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\topened its gates to them because the people were oppressed by hunger, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause, of present evils, they were accustomed to yield to the ones which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere immediately weighing upon them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Sulla learned this he came on immediately and established his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the gates in the Campus Martius. He went inside himself, all of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite faction having fled. Their property was at once confiscated and\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to public sale. Sulla summoned the people to an assembly, where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamented the necessity of his present doings and told them to cheer up, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe troubles would soon be over and the government go as it ought. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarranged such matters as were pressing and put some of his own men in charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the city, he set out for Clusium, where the war was still raging. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeantime a body of Celtiberian horse, sent by the pr\u00e6tors in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, had joined the consuls, and there was a cavalry fight on the banks of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Glanis. Sulla killed about fifty of the enemy, and then 270 of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeltiberian horse deserted to him, and Carbo himself killed the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, either because he was angry at the desertion of their countrymen or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he feared similar action on their own part. About the same time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla overcame another detachment of his enemies near Saturnia, and Metellus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed around toward Ravenna and took possession of the level, wheat-growing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry of Uritanus. Another Sullan division effected an entrance into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNeapolis by treachery in the night, killed all the inhabitants except a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had made their escape, and seized the triremes belonging to the city. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere battle was fought near Clusium between Sulla himself and Carbo,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlasting all day. Neither party had the advantage when darkness put an end to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe conflict. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the plain of Spoletium, Pompey and Crassus, both Sulla's officers, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome 3000 of Carbo's men and besieged Carinas, the opposing general. Carbo\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent re\u00ebnforcements to Carinas, but Sulla learned of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovement, laid an ambush for them, and killed about 2000 of them on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad. Carinas escaped by night during a heavy rain-storm and thick darkness,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand although the besiegers were aware of some movement, they made no\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposition on account of the storm. Carbo sent Marcius with eight legions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relief of his colleague, Marius, at Pr\u00e6neste, having heard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was suffering from hunger. Pompey fell upon them from ambush in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefile, defeated them, killed a large number, and surrounded the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a hill. Marcius made his escape, leaving his fires burning. His army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblamed him for being caught in an ambush and stirred up an angry mutiny. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole legion marched off under their standards to Ariminum without orders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rest separated and went home in squads, so that only seven cohorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained with their general. Marcius, having made a mess of it in this way,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to Carbo. However, Marcus Lamponius from Lucania, Pontius Telesinus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Samnium, and Gutta the Capuan, with 70,000 men, hastened to deliver\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius from the siege, but Sulla occupied a pass which was the only approach\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the place, and blocked the road. Marius now despaired of aid from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout, and built a citadel in the wide space between himself and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, within which he collected his soldiers and his engines, and from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he attempted to force his way through the besieging army of Lucretius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe attempt was renewed several days in different ways, but he accomplished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing and was again shut up in Pr\u00e6neste. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About the same time Carbo and Norbanus went by a short road to attack the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp of Metellus in Faventia just before nightfall. There was only one hour\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof daylight left, and there were thick vineyards thereabout. They made their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplans for battle in hot temper and not with good judgment, hoping to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus unawares and to stampede him. But they were beaten, both the place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the time being unfavorable for them. They became entangled in the vines,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand suffered a heavy slaughter, losing some 10,000 men. About 6000 more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserted, and the rest were dispersed, only 1000 getting back to Ariminum in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood order. Another legion of Lucanians under Albinovanus, when they heard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this defeat, went over to Metellus to the great chagrin of their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the latter was not able to restrain this impulse of his men, he, for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, returned to Norbanus. Not many days later he sent secretly to Sulla,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand having obtained a promise of safety from him, if he should accomplish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything important, he invited Norbanus and his lieutenants, Gaius Antipater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Flavius Fimbria (brother of the one who committed suicide in Asia),\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with such of Carbo's lieutenants as were then present, to a feast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen they had all assembled except Norbanus (he was the only one who did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome), Albinovanus killed them all at the banquet and then fled to Sulla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorbanus having learned that, in consequence of this disaster, Ariminum and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany other camps in the vicinity were going over to Sulla, and being unable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rely on the good faith and firm support of any of his friends there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent, since he found himself in adversity, took ship as a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividual and sailed to Rhodes. When, at a later period, Sulla demanded his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender, and while the Rhodians were deliberating on it, he killed himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the market-place. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Carbo sent Damasippus in haste with two other legions to Pr\u00e6neste\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto relieve Marius, who was still besieged, but not even these could force\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir way through the pass that was guarded by Sulla. The Gauls who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabited the country lying between Ravenna and the Alps went over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus en masse and Lucullus won a victory over another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of Carbo's forces near Placentia. When Carbo learned these facts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough he still had 30,000 men around Clusium, and the two legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDamasippus, and others under Carinas and Marcius, besides a large force of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites, who were courageously enduring hardships at the pass, he fell into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespair and weakly fled to Africa with his friends, although he was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul, in order to make a stand there instead of in Italy. Of those whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft behind, the army around Clusium had a battle with Pompey in which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost 20,000. Naturally, after this greatest disaster of all, the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the army dissolved in fragments and each man went to his own home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarinas, Marcius, and Damasippus went with all the forces they had to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpass in order to force their way through it in conjunction with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites. Failing in the attempt, they marched to Rome, thinking that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity might be easily taken, as it was bereft of men and provisions, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped in the Alban territory at a distance of 100 stades from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sulla feared for the safety of the city, and sent his cavalry forward with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall speed to hinder their march, and then hastened in person with his whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy and encamped alongside the Colline gate around the temple of Venus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout noon. The enemy were already encamped around the city. A battle was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought at once, late in the afternoon. On the right wing Sulla was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictorious. His left wing was vanquished and fled to the gates. The old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers on the walls, when they saw the enemy rushing in with their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, dropped the portcullis. It fell upon and killed many soldiers and many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators. But the majority, impelled by fear and necessity, turned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought the enemy. The fighting continued through the night and a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere killed. The generals, Telesinus and Albinus, were killed and their camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas taken. Lamponius the Lucanian, Marcius, and Carinas, and the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals of the faction of Carbo, fled. It was estimated that 50,000 men on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth sides lost their lives in this engagement. Prisoners, to the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than 8000, were shot down with darts by Sulla because they were mostly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites. The next day Marcius and Carinas were captured and brought in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla did not spare them because they were Romans, but killed them both and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent their heads to Lucretius at Pr\u00e6neste to be displayed around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Pr\u00e6nestians saw them and knew that Carbo's army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely destroyed, and that Norbanus himself had fled from Italy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Rome and all the rest of Italy were in the power of Sulla, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrendered their city to Lucretius. Marius hid himself in an underground\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttunnel and shortly afterward committed suicide. Lucretius cut off his head\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sent it to Sulla, who exposed it in the forum in front of the rostra. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis said that he indulged in a jest at the youth of the consul, saying that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone ought to be a rower before he manages the helm. When Lucretius took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPr\u00e6neste he seized the senators who had held commands under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius, and put some of them to death and cast the others into prison. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter were put to death by Sulla when he came that way. All the others who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere taken in Pr\u00e6neste he ordered to march out to the plain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout arms, and when they had done so he chose out a very few who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin any way serviceable to him. The remainder he ordered to be divided into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree parts, consisting of Romans, Samnites, and Pr\u00e6nestians\n\t\t\t\t\t\trespectively. When this had been done he announced to the Romans by herald\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they had merited death, but nevertheless he would pardon them. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers he massacred to the last man. He allowed their wives and children to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo unharmed. He plundered the town, which was extremely rich at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this way was Pr\u00e6neste served. Norba, another town, still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresisted with all its might until \u00c6milius Lepidus was admitted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit in the night by treachery. The inhabitants were maddened by this treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome killed themselves, or fell on each other's swords, others strangled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves with ropes. Still others closed the gates and set fire to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttown. A strong wind fanned the flames, which so far consumed the place that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno plunder was left in it. In this way did these stout-hearted men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperish. \n\t\t\t\t"},"11":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After accomplishing these deeds throughout Italy by war, fire, and murder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla's generals visited the several cities and established garrisons at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspected places. Pompey was despatched to Africa against Carbo and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily against Carbo's friends who had taken refuge there. Sulla himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled the Roman people together in an assembly and made them a speech\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaunting his own exploits and making other menacing statements in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspire terror. He finished by saying that he would bring about a change\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would be beneficial to the public if they would obey him. He would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspare one of his enemies, but would visit them with the utmost severity. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould take vengeance by every means in his power on all pr\u00e6tors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tqu\u00e6stors, military tribunes, and everybody else who had committed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany hostile act after the day when the consul Scipio violated the agreement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade with him. After saying this he forthwith proscribed about forty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators and 1600 knights. He seems to have been the first one to punish by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscription, to offer prizes to assassins and rewards wards to informers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to threaten with punishment those who should conceal the proscribed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShortly afterward he added the names of other senators to the proscription.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of these, taken unawares, were killed where they were caught, in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouses, in the streets, or in the temples. Others were picked up, carried to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla, and thrown down at his feet. Others were dragged through the city and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrampled on, none of the spectators daring to utter a word of remonstrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst these horrors. Banishment was inflicted upon some and confiscation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon others. Spies were searching everywhere for those who had fled from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, and those whom they caught they killed. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There was much killing, banishment, and confiscation also among those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalians who had obeyed Carbo, or Marius, or Norbanus, or their lieutenants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSevere judgments of the courts were rendered against them throughout all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly on various charges--for exercising military command, for serving in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army, for contributing money, for rendering other service, or even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving counsel against Sulla. Hospitality, private friendship, the borrowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor lending of money, were alike accounted crimes. Now and then one would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrested for doing a kindness to a suspect, or merely for being his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanion on a journey. These accusations abounded mostly against the rich.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen charges against individuals failed Sulla took vengeance on whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunities. He punished some of them by demolishing their citadels, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestroying their walls, or by imposing heavy fines and contributions on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Among most of them he placed colonies of his troops in order to hold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly under garrisons, sequestrating their lands and houses and dividing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem among his soldiers, whom he thus made true to him during his life and\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven after his death. As they could not be secure in their own holdings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunless all of Sulla's affairs were on a firm foundation, they were his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstoutest champions even after he was deceased. While the affairs of Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in this state, Pompey sent a force and captured Carbo, who had fled\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith many persons of distinction from Africa to Sicily and thence to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisland of Cossyra. He ordered his officers to kill all of the others without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing them into his presence; but Carbo, who had been thrice consul, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaused to be brought before his feet in chains, and after making a public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharangue at him, killed him and sent his head to Sulla. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When everything had been accomplished against his enemies as he desired, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was no longer any hostile force except that of Sertorius, who was far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistant, Sulla sent Metellus into Spain against him and managed everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the city to suit himself. There was no longer any occasion for laws, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\telections, or for casting lots, because everybody was shivering with fear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in hiding, or dumb. Everything that Sulla had done as consul, or as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproconsul, was confirmed and ratified, and his gilded equestrian statue was\n\t\t\t\t\t\terected in front of the rostra with the inscription, \"Cornelius Sulla, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortunate commander,\" for so his flatterers called him on account of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunbroken success against his enemies. And this flattering title still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattaches to him. I have come across a history which relates that Sulla was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstyled Epaphroditus by a decree of the Senate itself. This does not seem to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme to be inappropriate for he was also called Faustus (lucky), which name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to have very nearly the same signification as Epaphroditus. There was\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso an oracle given to him somewhere which, in response to his question\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning the future, assured his prosperous career as follows:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t \"Believe me, Roman, the Cyprian goddess cares for the race of \u00c6neas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand has given it great power. Render yearly gifts to all the immortals, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo not forget them. Convey gifts to Delphi. There is also a place where men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo up under snowy Taurus, a wide-reaching city of the Carians, whose inhabitants have named it for Aphrodite. Give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoddess an axe and you shall gain sovereign power.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Whichever decree the Romans voted when they erected the statue, they seem to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme to have made the inscription by way of jest or cajolery. However, Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent a golden crown and an axe to Venus with this inscription:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t \"The dictator Sulla dedicates this to thee, Venus, because in a dream he saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthee in panoply setting the army in order of battle and fighting with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweapons of Mars.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus Sulla became king, or tyrant, de facto, not elected,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut holding power by force and violence. As, however, he needed some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretence of being elected it was managed in this way. The kings of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans in the olden time were chosen for their bravery, and when one of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdied the senators held the royal power in succession for five days each,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil the people could decide who should be the new king. This five-day\n\t\t\t\t\t\truler was called the Interrex, which means king for the time being. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretiring consuls always presided over the election of their successors in\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice, and if there chanced to be no consul at such a time an Interrex was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed for the purpose of holding the consular comitia. Sulla took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvantage of this custom. There were no consuls at this time, Carbo having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost his life in Sicily and Marius in Pr\u00e6neste. So Sulla went out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the city for a time and ordered the Senate to choose an Interrex. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchose Valerius Flaccus, expecting that he would soon hold the consular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomitia. But Sulla wrote to Flaccus to bring before the people the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposition that he (Sulla) considered it advisable, under present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances, that the city should be governed by a dictator according to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustom that had been abandoned 400 years. He told them not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto appoint the dictator for any definite time, but until the city and Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the whole government, so shaken by factions and wars, should be put upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta firm foundation. That this proposal referred to Sulla himself was not at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall doubtful. Sulla made no concealment of it. At the conclusion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tletter he declared openly that, in his judgment, he could be serviceable to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city in that capacity. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was Sulla's letter. The Romans were unwilling, but they had no more\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunities for elections according to law, and they considered that this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter was not altogether in their own power. So, in the absence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything else, they welcomed this pretence of an election as an image and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsemblance of freedom and chose Sulla their absolute master for as long a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime as he pleased. There had been autocratic rule of the dictators before,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it was limited to short periods. But in Sulla's time it first became\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunlimited and so an absolute tyranny; yet they added, for propriety's sake,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they chose him dictator for the enactment of such laws as he might deem\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbest and for the regulation of the commonwealth. Thus the Romans, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving government by kings for sixty Olympiads, and a democracy, under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls chosen yearly, for 100 Olympiads, resorted to kingly government\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain. This was in the 175th Olympiad according to the Greek calendar, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were no Olympic games then except races in the stadium, since Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad carried away the athletes and all the sights and shows to Rome to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcelebrate his victories in the Mithridatic and Italian wars, under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretext that the masses needed a breathing-spell and recreation after their\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoils. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, as the form of the republic remained he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed them to appoint consuls. Marcus Tullius and Cornelius Dolabella were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen. But Sulla, like a reigning sovereign, was dictator over the consuls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTwenty-four axes were borne in front of him, as was customary with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdictators, the same number that were borne before the ancient kings, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a large body-guard also. He repealed laws and he enacted others. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbade anybody to hold the office of pr\u00e6tor until after he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld that of qu\u00e6stor, or to be consul before he had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tor, and he prohibited any man from holding the same office a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond time till after the lapse of ten years. He reduced the tribunician\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower to such an extent that it seemed to be destroyed. He curtailed it by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw which provided that one holding the office of tribune should never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafterward hold any other office; for which reason all men of reputation or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamily, who formerly contended for this office, shunned it thereafter. I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot able to say positively whether Sulla transferred this office from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople to the Senate, where it is now lodged, or not. To the Senate itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been much thinned by the seditions and wars, he added about 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers from the best of the knights, taking the vote of the tribes for each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone. To the plebeians he added more than 10,000 slaves of proscribed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons, choosing the youngest and strongest, to whom he gave freedom and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman citizenship, and he called them Cornelii after himself. In this way he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade sure of having 10,000 men among the plebeians always ready to obey his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands. In order to provide the same kind of safeguard throughout Italy he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistributed to the twenty-three legions that had served under him a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal of land among the communities, as I have already related, some of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas public property and some taken from the communities by way of fine. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So terrible was he and so uncontrollable in anger that he slew in the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forum Q. Lucretius Ofella, the one who had besieged and captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPr\u00e6neste and the consul Marius, and had won the final victory for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. He did this because, in spite of the new law, Lucretius persisted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough Sulla opposed and forbade, in being a candidate for the consulship\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was still in the equestrian order and before he had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tqu\u00e6stor and pr\u00e6tor, presuming on the greatness of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices, according to the former custom, and captivating the populace. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla assembled the people and said to them, \"Know, citizens, and learn from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme, that I caused the death of Lucretius because he disobeyed me.\" And then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the told the following story: \"A husbandman was bitten by fleas while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tploughing. He stopped his ploughing twice in order to clear them out of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshirt. When they bit him. again he burned his shirt, so that he might not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso often interrupted in his work. And I tell you, who have felt my hand\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwice, to take warning lest the third time fire be brought in requisition.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith these words he terrified them and thereafter ruled as he pleased. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a triumph on account of the Mithridatic war, during which some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscoffers called his government \" the royalty disavowed\" because only the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname of king was concealed. Others took the contrary view, judging from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacts, and called it \"the tyranny confessed.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Into such evils were the Romans and all the Italians plunged by this war; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso likewise were all the countries beyond Italy by the recent piracies, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Mithridatic war, or by the many exhausting taxes levied to meet the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeficit in the public treasury due to the seditions. All the allied nations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand kings, and not only the tributary cities, but those which had delivered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to the Romans voluntarily under sworn agreements, and those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby virtue of their furnishing aid in war or for some other merit were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tautonomous and not subject to tribute, all were now required to pay and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobey. Some that had surrendered themselves under treaty arrangements were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprived of their territory and their harbors. Sulla decreed that Alexander\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(the son of Alexander the former sovereign of Egypt), who had been reared in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCos and given to Mithridates by the inhabitants of that island, and had fled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Sulla and become intimate with him, should be king of Alexandria. He did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis because the government of Alexandria was destitute of a sovereign in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe male line, and the women of the royal house wanted a man of the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlineage, and because he (Sulla) expected to reap a large reward from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trich kingdom. As Alexander behaved himself in a very offensive manner toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, relying upon Sulla, the Alexandrians, on the nineteenth day of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\treign, dragged him from the palace to the gymnasium and put him to death; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle fear had they of foreigners, either by reason of the magnitude of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own government or their inexperience as yet of external dangers. \n\t\t\t\t"},"12":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The following year Sulla, although he was dictator, undertook\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship a second time, with Metellus Pius for his colleague, in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto preserve the pretence and form of democratic government. It is perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom this example that the Roman emperors now make a showing of consuls to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe country and even exhibit themselves in that capacity, considering it not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunbecoming to hold the office of consul in connection with the supreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower. The next year the people, in order to pay court to Sulla, chose him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul again, but he refused the office and nominated Servilius Isauricus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Claudius Pulcher for their suffrages, and voluntarily laid down the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupreme power, although nobody was troubling him. This act seems wonderful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto me--that Sulla should have been the first, and till then the only one, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabdicate such vast power without compulsion, not to sons (like Ptolemy in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt, or Ariobarzanes in Cappadocia, or Seleucus in Syria), but to the very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople over whom he had tyrannized. Almost incredible is it that after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincurring so many dangers in forcing his way to this power he should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid it down of his own free will after he had acquired it. Paradoxical\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeyond anything is the fact that he was afraid of nothing, although more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan 100,000 young men had perished in this war, and he had destroyed of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies ninety senators, fifteen consulars, and 2600 of the so-called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights, including the banished. The property of these men had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfiscated and many of their bodies cast out unburied. Undaunted by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatives of these persons at home, or by the banished abroad, or by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities whose \n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowers and walls he had thrown down and whose lands, money,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand privileges he had swept away, Sulla now returned to private life. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So great was this man's boldness and good fortune. It is said that he made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech in the forum when he laid down his power in which he offered to give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe reasons for what he had done to anybody who should ask them. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdismissed the lictors with their axes and discontinued his body-guard, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a long time walked to the forum with only a few friends, the multitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooking upon him with awe even then. Once only when he was going home he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached by a boy. As nobody restrained this boy he made bold to follow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla to his house, railing at him, and Sulla, who had opposed the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen and states with towering rage, endured his reproaches with calmness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas he went into the house said, divining the future either by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintelligence or by chance, \"This young man will prevent any other holder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch power from laying it down.\" This saying was shortly confirmed to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, for Gaius C\u00e6sar never laid down his power. Sulla seems to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme to have been the same masterful and able man in all respects, whether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstriving to reach supreme power from private life, or changing back to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate life from supreme power, or later when passing his time in rural\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolitude; for he retired to his own estate at Cum\u00e6 in Italy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere occupied his leisure in hunting and fishing. He did this not because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was afraid to live a private life in the city, nor because he had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient bodily strength for whatever he might try to do. He was still of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvirile age and sound constitution, and there were 120,000 men throughout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly who had recently served under him in war and had received large gifts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof money and land from him, and there were the 10,000 Cornelii ready in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, besides other people of his party devoted to him and still formidable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his opponents, all of whom rested upon Sulla's safety their hopes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpunity for what they had done in co\u00f6peration with him. But I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that he was satiated with war, with power, with city affairs, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the took to rural life finally because he loved it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Directly after his retirement the Romans, although delivered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom slaughter and tyranny, began gradually to fan the flames of new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseditions. Quintus Catulus and \u00c6milius Lepidus were chosen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, the former of the Sullan faction and the latter of the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty. They hated each other bitterly and began to quarrel immediately, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich it was plain that fresh troubles were brewing. While he was living in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe country Sulla had a dream in which he thought he saw his Genius already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalling him. Early in the morning he told the dream to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends and in haste began writing his will, which he finished that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter sealing it he was taken with a fever towards evening and died the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight. He was sixty years of age and had been the most fortunate of men even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the very last, and realized in all respects the title he bore; that is,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif one can be considered fortunate who obtains all that he desires.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImmediately a dissension sprang up in the city over his remains, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposing to bring them in a procession through Italy and exhibit them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forum and give him a public funeral. Lepidus and his faction opposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, but Catulus and the Sullan party prevailed. Sulla's corpse was borne\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough Italy on a golden litter with royal splendor. Musicians and horsemen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin great numbers went in advance and a great multitude of armed men followed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton foot. His fellow-soldiers flocked from all directions under arms to join\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe procession, and each one was assigned his place in due order as he came.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe crowd of other people that came together was unprecedented. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards and the fasces that he had used while living and ruling were borne\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the procession. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the remains reached the city they were borne through the streets with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenormous procession. More than 2000 golden crowns which had been made in\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaste were carried in it, the gifts of cities and of the legions that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommanded and of individual friends. It would be impossible to describe all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe splendid things contributed to this funeral. From fear of the assembled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiery all the priests and priestesses escorted the remains, each in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproper costume. The entire Senate and the whole body of magistrates attended\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their insignia of office. A multitude of the Roman knights followed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their peculiar decorations, and, in their turn, all the legions that\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fought under him. They came together with eagerness, all hastening to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin in the task, carrying gilded standards and silver-plated shields, such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas are still used on such occasions. There was a countless number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrumpeters who by turns played the most mournful dirges. Loud cries were\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised, first by the Senate, then by the knights, then by the soldiers, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinally by the plebeians. For some really longed for Sulla, but others were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafraid of his army and his dead body, as they had been of himself when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliving. As they looked at the present spectacle and remembered what this man\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad accomplished they were amazed, and agreed with their opponents that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been most beneficial to his own party and most formidable to themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven in death. The corpse was shown in the forum on the rostra, where public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeeches were usually made, and the most eloquent of the Romans then living\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered the funeral oration, as Sulla's son, Faustus, was still very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyoung. Then strong men of the senators took up the litter and carried it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Campus Martius, where only kings were buried, and the knights and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy coursed around the funeral pile. And this was the last of Sulla. \n\t\t\t\t"},"13":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Directly after their return from the funeral the consuls fell into a wordy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarrel and the citizens began to take sides with them. Lepidus, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurry favor with the Italians, said that he would restore the land which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla had taken from them. The Senate was afraid of both factions and made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem take an oath that they would not carry their differences to the point\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof war. To Lepidus the province of transalpine Gaul was assigned by lot and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the did not come back to the comitia because he would be released in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing year from his oath about making war on the Sullans; for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered that the oath was binding only during the term of office. As his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigns did not escape observation he was recalled by the Senate, and as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknew why he was recalled he came with his whole army, intending to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem into the city with him. As he was prevented from doing this, he ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\this men under arms and Catulus did the same on the other side. A battle was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought not far from the Campus Martius. Lepidus was defeated and, soon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving up the struggle, sailed shortly afterward to Sardinia, where he died\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a wasting disease. His army was frittered away little by little and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolved, the greater part of it was conducted by Perpenna to Sertorius in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There remained of the Sullan troubles the war with Sertorius, which had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing on for eight years, and was not an easy war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Romans since it was waged not merely against Spaniards, but against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother Romans and Sertorius. He had been chosen governor of Spain while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas co\u00f6perating with Carbo against Sulla; and after taking the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Suessa during the armistice he fled and assumed his pr\u00e6torship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe had an army from Italy itself and he raised another from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeltiberians, and drove out of Spain the former pr\u00e6tors, who, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to favor Sulla, refused to surrender the government to him. He had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso fought nobly against Metellus, who had been sent against him by Sulla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving acquired a reputation for bravery he enrolled a council of 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers from the friends who were with him, and called it the Roman Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin derision of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe real one. After Sulla died, and Lepidus later, he obtained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother army of Italians which Perpenna, the lieutenant of Lepidus, brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him and it was supposed that he intended to march against Italy itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand would have done so had not the Senate become alarmed and sent another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy and general into Spain in addition to the former ones. This general was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey, who was still a young man, but renowned for his exploits in the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Sulla, in Africa and in Italy itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey courageously crossed the Alps, not in the face of such difficulties as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHannibal experienced, but he opened another passage around the sources of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Rhone and the Eridanus. These issue from the Alpine mountains not far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom each other. One of them runs through transalpine Gaul and empties into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Tyrrhenian sea; the other from the interior of the Alps to the Adriatic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe name of the latter has been changed from the Eridanus to the Po. Directly Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrived in Spain Sertorius cut in pieces a whole legion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this army, that had been sent out foraging, with its animals and servants. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso plundered and destroyed the Roman town of Lauro before the very eyes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey. In this siege a woman tore out with her fingers the eyes of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldier who had insulted her and was trying to commit an outrage upon her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Sertorius heard of this he put to death the whole cohort that was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupposed to be addicted to such brutality, although it was composed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans. Then the armies were separated by the advent of winter. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When spring came they resumed hostilities, Metellus and Pompey coming from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pyrenees mountains, where they had wintered, and Sertorius and Perpenna\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Lusitania. They met near the town of Sucro. While the fight was going\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton flashes of lightning came unexpectedly from a clear sky, but these\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrained soldiers were not in the least dismayed. They continued the fight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith heavy slaughter on both sides, until Metellus defeated Perpenna and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplundered his camp. On the other hand, Sertorius defeated Pompey, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived a dangerous wound from a spear in the thigh, and this put an end to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat battle. Sertorius had a white fawn that was tame and allowed to move\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout freely. When this fawn was not visible Sertorius considered it a bad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tomen. He became low-spirited and abstained from fighting; nor did he mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy's scoffing at the fawn. When she made her appearance running\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the woods Sertorius would run to meet her and, as though he were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspired by her, he would begin to harass the enemy. Not long afterward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius fought a great battle near Seguntia, lasting from noon till night.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius fought on horseback and vanquished Pompey, killing nearly 6000 of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this men and losing about half that number himself. Metellus at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed about 5000 of Perpenna's army. The day after this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle Sertorius, with a large re\u00ebnforcement of barbarians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked the camp of Metellus unexpectedly towards evening with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintention of besieging it with a trench, but Pompey hastened up and caused\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius to desist from his bold enterprise. In this way they passed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummer, and again they separated to winter quarters. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The following year, which was in the 176th Olympiad, two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries were acquired by the Romans by bequest. Bithynia was left to them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Nicomedes, and Cyrene by Ptolemy Apion, of the house of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLagid\u00e6. There were wars and wars; the Sertorian was raging in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, the Mithridatic in the East, that of the pirates on the entire sea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand another one around Crete against the Cretans themselves, besides the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiatorial war in Italy, which started suddenly and became very serious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough distracted by so many conflicts the Romans sent another army of two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions into Spain. With these and the other forces in their hands Metellus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pompey again descended from the Pyrenees mountains to the Ebro and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius and Perpenna advanced from Lusitania to meet them. At this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjuncture many of the soldiers of Sertorius deserted to Metellus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sertorius was so exasperated by this that he visited savage and barbarous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment upon many of his men and fell into disrepute in consequence. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers blamed him particularly because wherever he went he surrounded\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself with a body-guard of Celtiberian spearmen instead of Romans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremoving the latter in favor of the former. Nor could they bear to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached with treachery by him while they were serving under an enemy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Roman people. That they should be charged with bad faith by Sertorius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile they were acting in bad faith to their country on his account, was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery thing that vexed them most. Nor did they consider it just that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho remained with the standards should be condemned because others deserted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, the Celtiberians took this occasion to insult them as men under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspicion. Still they were not altogether alienated from Sertorius since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey derived advantages from his service, for there was no other man of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod more skilled in the art of war or more successful in it. For this\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason, and on account of the rapidity of his movements, the Celtiberians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave him the name of Hannibal, whom they considered the boldest and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrafty general ever known in their country. In this way the army stood\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected toward Sertorius. The forces of Metellus overran many of his towns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand brought the men belonging to them under subjection. While Pompey was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaying siege to Pallantia and underrunning the walls with wooden supports,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSertorius suddenly appeared on the scene and raised the siege. Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastily set fire to the timbers and retreated to Metellus. Sertorius rebuilt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part of the wall which had fallen and then attacked his enemies who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped around the castle of Calagurris and killed 3000 of them. And so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis year went by in Spain. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the following year the Roman generals plucked up rather\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore courage and advanced in an audacious manner against the towns that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadhered to Sertorius, drew many away from him, assaulted others, and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch elated by their success. No great battle was fought, but again . . . until the following year, when they advanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain even more audaciously. Sertorius was now evidently misled by a god, for he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelaxed his labors, fell into habits of luxury, and gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself up to women, and to carousing and drinking, for which reason he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeated continually. He became hot-tempered, from various suspicions, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremely cruel in punishment, and distrustful of everybody, so much so that Perpenna, who had belonged to the faction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus and had come hither as a volunteer with a considerable army, began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fear for his own safety and formed a conspiracy with ten other men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him. The conspiracy was betrayed, some of the guilty ones were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunished and others fled, but Perpenna escaped detection in some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunaccountable manner and applied himself all the more to carry out the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign. As Sertorius was never without his guard of spearmen, Perpenna\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvited him to a banquet, plied him and his guards with wine, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassassinated him after the feast. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers straightway rose in tumult and anger against Perpenna, their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred of Sertorius being suddenly turned to affection for him, as people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally mollify their anger toward the dead, and when the one who has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinjured them is no longer before their eyes recall his virtues with tender\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmemory. Reflecting on their present situation they despised Perpenna as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough he had been a private individual, for they considered that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbravery of Sertorius had been their only salvation. They were angry with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerpenna, and the barbarians were no less so; most of all were the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLusitanians, of whose services Sertorius had especially availed himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen the will of Sertorius was opened a bequest to Perpenna was found in it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand thereupon still greater anger and hatred of him entered into the minds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof all, since he had committed such an abominable crime, not merely against\n\t\t\t\t\t\this ruler and commanding general, but against his friend and benefactor. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would not have abstained from violence had not Perpenna bestirred\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, making gifts to some and promises to others. Some he terrified with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreats and some he killed in order to strike terror into the rest. He came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward and made a speech to the multitude, and released from confinement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome whom Sertorius had imprisoned, and dismissed some of the Spanish\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostages. Reduced to submission in this way they obeyed him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tor (for he held the next rank to Sertorius) yet they were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout bitterness toward him even then. As he grew bolder he became very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcruel in punishments, and put to death three of the nobility who had fled\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether from Rome to him, and also his own nephew. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As Metellus had gone to other parts of Spain,-- for he considered it no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger a difficult task for Pompey alone to vanquish Perpenna, -- these two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tskirmished and made tests of each other for several days, but did not bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir whole strength into the field. On the tenth day, however, a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle was fought between them. They resolved to decide the contest by one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement--Pompey because he despised the generalship of Perpenna; Perpenna\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he did not believe that his army would long remain faithful to him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he could now engage with nearly his whole strength. Pompey, as might\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been expected, soon got the better of this inferior general and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaffected army. Perpenna was defeated all along the line and concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself in a thicket, more fearful of his own troops than of the enemy's. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas seized by some horsemen and dragged toward Pompey's headquarters, loaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the execrations of his own men, as the murderer of Sertorius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrying out that he could give Pompey a great deal of information about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactions in Rome. This he said either because it was true, or in order to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought safe to Pompey's presence, but the latter sent orders to kill him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore bringing him into his presence, fearing lest the news that Perpenna\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted to communicate should be the source of new troubles at Rome. Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to have behaved very prudently in this matter, and his action added to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this high reputation. So ended the war in Spain with the life of Sertorius. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that if he had lived longer the war would not have ended so soon or so\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessfully. \n\t\t\t\t"},"14":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time Spartacus, a Thracian by birth, who had once served as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldier with the Romans, but had since been a prisoner and sold for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiator, and was in the gladiatorial training-school at Capua, persuaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout seventy of his comrades to strike for their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom rather than for the amusement of spectators. They overcame the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguards and ran away. They armed themselves with clubs and daggers that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook from people on the roads and took refuge on Mount Vesuvius. There many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfugitive slaves and even some freemen from the fields joined Spartacus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the plundered the neighboring country, having for subordinate officers two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiators named \u0152nomaus and Crixus. As he divided the plunder\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpartially he soon had plenty of men. Varinius Glaber was first sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him and afterward Publius Valerius, not with regular armies, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith forces picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider this a war as yet, but a raid, something like an outbreak of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trobbery. When they attacked Spartacus they were beaten. Spartacus even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured the horse of Varinius; so narrowly did a Roman pr\u00e6tor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescape being captured by a gladiator. After this still greater numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflocked to Spartacus till his army numbered 70,000 men. For these he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanufactured weapons and collected apparatus. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rome now sent out the consuls with two legions. One of them overcame Crixus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith 30,000 men near Mount Garganus, two-thirds of whom perished together\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith himself. Spartacus endeavored to make his way through the Apennines to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Alps and the Gallic country, but one of the consuls anticipated him and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thindered his march while the other hung upon his rear. He turned upon them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone after the other and beat them in detail. They retreated in confusion in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent directions. Spartacus sacrificed 300 Roman prisoners to the manes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Crixus, and marched on Rome with 120,000 foot, having burned all his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseless material, killed all his prisoners, and butchered his pack-animals\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to expedite his movement. Many deserters offered themselves to him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut he would not accept them. The consuls again met him in the country of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPicenum. Here was another great battle and then, too, a great defeat for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans. Spartacus changed his intention of marching on Rome. He did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider himself ready as yet for that kind of a fight, as his whole force\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not suitably armed, for no city had joined him, but only slaves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserters, and riff-raff. However, he occupied the mountains\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround Thurii and took the city itself. He prohibited the bringing in of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgold or silver by merchants, and would not allow his own men to acquire any,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut he bought largely of iron and brass and did not interfere with those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdealt in these articles. Supplied with abundant material from this source\n\t\t\t\t\t\this men provided themselves with plenty of arms and continued in robbery for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe time being. When they next came to an engagement with the Romans they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere again victorious, and returned laden with spoils. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This war, so formidable to the Romans (although \n\t\t\t\t\t\tridiculous and contemptible in the beginning, considered as the work of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiators), had now lasted three years. When the election of new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tors came on, fear fell upon all, and nobody offered himself as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta candidate until Licinius Crassus, a man distinguished among the Romans for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirth and wealth, assumed the pr\u00e6torship and marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpartacus with six new legions. When he arrived at his destination he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived also the two legions of the consuls, whom he decimated by lot for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir bad conduct in several battles. Some say that Crassus, too, having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengaged in battle with his whole army, and having been defeated, decimated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole army and was not deterred by their numbers, but destroyed about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4000 of them. Whichever way it was, he demonstrated to them that he was more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdangerous to them than the enemy. Presently he overcame 10,000 of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpartacans, who were encamped somewhere in a detached position, and killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo-thirds of them. He then marched boldly against Spartacus himself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvanquished him in a brilliant engagement, and pursued his fleeing forces to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea, where they tried to pass over to Sicily. He overtook them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed them with a line of circumvallation consisting of ditch, wall, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaling. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Spartacus tried to break through and make an incursion into the Samnite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry, but Crassus slew about 6000 of his men in the morning and as many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore towards evening. Only three of the Roman army were killed and seven\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounded, so great was the improvement in their morale \n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspired by the recent punishment. Spartacus, who was expecting from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhere a re\u00ebnforcement of horse, no longer went into battle with\n\t\t\t\t\t\this whole army, but harassed the besiegers by frequent sallies here and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere. He fell upon them unexpectedly and continually, threw bundles of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfagots into the ditch and set them on fire and made their labor difficult.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe crucified a Roman prisoner in the space between the two armies to show\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own men what fate awaited them if they did not conquer. When the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the city heard of the siege they thought it would be disgraceful if this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar against gladiators should be prolonged. Believing also that the work\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill to be done against Spartacus was great and severe they ordered up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy of Pompey, which had just arrived from Spain, as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tre\u00ebnforcement. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t On account of this vote Crassus tried in every way to come to an engagement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Spartacus so that Pompey might not reap the glory of the war. Spartacus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, thinking to anticipate Pompey, invited Crassus to come to terms\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him. When his proposals were rejected with scorn he resolved to risk a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle, and as his cavalry had arrived he made a dash with his whole army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the lines of the besieging force and pushed on to Brundusium with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrassus in pursuit. When Spartacus learned that Lucullus had just arrived in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium from his victory over Mithridates he despaired of everything and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought his forces, which were even then very numerous, to close quarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Crassus. The battle was long and bloody, as might have been expected\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith so many thousands of desperate men. Spartacus was wounded in the thigh\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a spear and sank upon his knee, holding his shield in front of him and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontending in this way against his assailants until he and the great mass of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose with him were surrounded and slain. The remainder of his army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrown into confusion and butchered in crowds. So great was the slaughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it was impossible to count them. The Roman loss was about 1000. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of Spartacus was not found. A large number of his men fled from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle-field to the mountains and Crassus followed them thither. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided themselves in four parts, and continued to fight until they all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished except 6000, who were captured and crucified along the whole road\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Capua to Rome. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Crassus accomplished his task within six months, whence arose a contention\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor honors between himself and Pompey. Crassus did not dismiss his army, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey did not dismiss his. Both were candidates for the consulship. Crassus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been pr\u00e6tor as the law of Sulla required. Pompey had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither pr\u00e6tor nor qu\u00e6stor, and was only thirty-four\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears old. He promised the tribunes of the people that much of their former\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower should be restored. When they were chosen consuls they did not even then dismiss their armies, which were stationed near\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city. Each one offered an excuse. Pompey said that he was waiting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn of Metellus for his Spanish triumph. Crassus said that Pompey ought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto dismiss his army first. The people, seeing fresh seditions brewing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearing two armies encamped round about, besought the consuls, while they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere occupying the curule chairs in the forum, to be reconciled to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother. At first both of them repelled these solicitations. When certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons, who seemed to be divinely inspired, predicted many direful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences if the consuls did not come to an agreement, the people again\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplored them with lamentation and the greatest dejection, reminding them of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe evils produced by the contentions of Marius and Sulla. Crassus yielded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst. He came down from his chair, advanced to Pompey, and offered him his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand in the way of reconciliation. Pompey rose and hastened to meet him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey shook hands amid general acclamations and the people did not leave the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembly until the consuls had given orders in writing to disband the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies. Thus was the well-grounded fear of another great dissension happily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdispelled.

How\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things came about and how both Pompey and C\u00e6sar lost their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlives, this second book of the Civil Wars will show.

While yet \u00e6dile and pr\u00e6tor he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad incurred great debts and had made himself wonderfully agreeable to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude, who always sing the praises of those who are lavish in\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenditures. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At this time Lucius Catiline was a person of importance, of great celebrity, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh birth, but a madman. It was believed that he had killed his own son\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of his own love for Aurelia Orestilla, who was not willing to marry\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta man who had a son. He had been a friend and zealous partisan of Sulla.

He confidently expected to be elected; but the suspicion of his ulterior designs defeated him, and Cicero, the most eloquent orator and the rhetorician of the period, was chosen instead. Catiline, by way of raillery and contempt for those who voted for him, called him Novus Homo (a new man) on account of his obscure birth (for so they call those who achieve distinction by their own merits and not by those of their ancestors); and because he was not born in the city he called him Inquilinus (a lodger), by which term they designate those who occupy houses belonging to others. From this time Catiline abstained wholly from politics as not leading quickly and surely to absolute power, but as full of the spirit of contention and malice. He procured much money from many women who hoped that their husbands would get killed in the uprising, and he formed a conspiracy with a number of senators and knights, and collected together a body of plebians, foreign residents, and slaves. His leading fellow-conspirators were Cornelius Lentulus and Cethegus, who were then city praetors. He sent emissaries throughout Italy to those of Sulla's soldiers who had squandered the gains of their former life of plunder and who longed for similar doings. For this purpose he sent Gaius Manlius to F\u00e6sul\u00e6 in Etruria and others to Picenum and Apulia, who enlisted soldiers for him secretly.","2":"\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t All these facts, while they were still secret, were communicated to Cicero by Fulvia, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twoman of quality. Her lover, Quintus Curius, one of the conspirators\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith Catiline, who had been expelled from the Senate for debauchery,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttold his mistress in a vain and boastful way that he would soon be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a position of great power. And now a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trumor of what was transpiring in Italy was noised about.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, Cicero stationed guards at intervals throughout the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, and sent many of the nobility to the suspected places to watch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat was going on. Catiline, although nobody had ventured to lay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thands on him, because the facts were not yet publicly known,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas nevertheless fearful lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspicion should increase with time.

Lentulus sent in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany with them, to Catiline, a man of Croton named Vulturcius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried letters without signatures. The Allobroges being in doubt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunicated the matter to Fabius Sanga, the patron of their state--it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe custom of all the subject states to have patrons at Rome. Sanga\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunicated the facts to Cicero, who captured the Allobroges and Vulturcius\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton their journey and brought them straightway before the Senate. They confessed to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding with Lentulus and testified in his presence that Cornelius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLentulus had often said that it was written in the book of fate that three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornelii should be monarchs of Rome, two of whom, Cinna and Sulla, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready been such. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When they had so testified the Senate deprived Lentulus of his office. Cicero\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput each of the conspirators under arrest at the houses of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tors, and returned directly to take the vote of the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning them. In the meantime there was a great tumult around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenate-house, the affair being as yet little understood, and those who did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstand it being alarmed. The slaves and freedmen of Lentulus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCethegus, re\u00ebnforced by numerous artisans, made a circuit by back\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreets and assaulted the houses of the pr\u00e6tors in order to rescue\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir masters. When Cicero heard of this he hurried out of the senate-house\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand stationed the necessary guards and then came back and hastened the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking of the vote. Silanus, the consul-elect, spoke first, as it was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustom among the Romans for the one who was about to assume that office to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliver his opinion first, because, as I think, he would have most to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the execution of the decrees, and hence would give more careful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsideration and circumspection to each. It was the opinion of Silanus that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe culprits should suffer the extreme penalty, and many senators agreed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him until it came Nero's turn to deliver his opinion. Nero judged that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit would be best to keep them under guard until Catiline should be beaten in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe field and they could obtain the most accurate knowledge of the facts. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Gaius C\u00e6sar was not free from the suspicion of complicity with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese men, but Cicero did not venture to bring into the controversy one so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopular with the masses. C\u00e6sar proposed that Cicero should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribute the culprits among the towns of Italy, according to his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscretion, to be kept until Catiline should be beaten in fight, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen they should be regularly tried, instead of inflicting an irremediable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment upon members of the nobility in advance of argument and trial. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis opinion appeared to be just and acceptable, most of the senators\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged completely, until Cato openly manifested his suspicion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar; and Cicero, who had apprehensions concerning the coming\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight (lest the crowd who were concerned with the conspiracy and were still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the forum in a state of suspense, fearful for themselves and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspirators, might do something desperate), persuaded the Senate to give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjudgment against them without trial as persons caught in the act. Cicero\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately, while the Senate was still in session, conducted each of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspirators from the houses where they were in custody to the prison,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout the knowledge of the crowd, and saw them put to death. Then he went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback to the forum and signified that they were dead. The crowd dispersed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\talarm, congratulating themselves that they had not been found out. Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity breathed freely once more after the great fear that had weighed upon it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat day. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Catiline had assembled about 20,000 troops, of whom \n\t\t\t\t\t\tone-fourth part were already armed, and was moving toward Gaul in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplete his preparations, when Antonius, the other consul, overtook him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeyond the Alps \n\t\t\t\t\t\tand easily defeated the madly conceived adventure of the man, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill more madly put to the test without preparation. Neither Catiline nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany of the nobility who were associated with him deigned to fly, but all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished at close quarters with their enemies. Such was the end of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuprising of Catiline, which almost brought the city to the extreme of peril.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero, who had been hitherto distinguished only for eloquence, was now in\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverybody's mouth as a man of action, and was considered unquestionably the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaviour of his country on the eve of its destruction, for which reason the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks of the assembly were bestowed upon him, amid general acclamations. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe instance of Cato the people saluted him as the Father of his Country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome think that this appellation, which is now bestowed upon those emperors\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho are deemed worthy of it, had its beginning with Cicero. Although they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare in fact kings, it is not given to them with their other titles\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately upon their accession, but is decreed to them in the progress of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, not as a matter of course, but as a final testimonial of the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices. \n\t\t\t\t"},"1":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar, who had been chosen pr\u00e6tor for Spain, was detained in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity by his creditors, as he owed much more than he could pay, by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this political expenses. He was reported as saying that he needed 25,000,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsesterces in order to have nothing at all. However, he arranged\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith those who were detaining him as best he could and proceeded to Spain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere he neglected the transaction of public business, the administration of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjustice, and all matters of that kind because he considered them of no use\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposes, but he raised an army and attacked the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent Spanish tribes one by one until he made the whole country\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttributary to the Romans. He also sent much money to the public treasury at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome. For these reasons the Senate awarded him a triumph. He was making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations outside the walls for a most splendid procession, during the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdays when candidates for the consulship were required to present themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was not lawful for one who was going to have a triumph to enter the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then go back again for the triumph. As C\u00e6sar was very anxious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto secure the office, and his procession was not yet ready, he sent to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate and asked permission to stand for the consulship while absent,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the intercession of friends, for although he knew it was against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw it had been done by others. Cato opposed his proposition and used up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast day for the presentation of candidates, in speech making. Thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar abandoned his triumph, entered the city, offered himself as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta candidate, and waited for the comitia. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime Pompey, who had acquired great glory and power by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridatic war, was asking the Senate to ratify numerous concessions that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had granted to kings, princes, and cities. Many senators, however, moved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby envy, made opposition, and especially Lucullus, who had held the command\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Mithridates before Pompey, and who considered that the victory was\n\t\t\t\t\t\this, since he had left the king in a state of extreme weakness for Pompey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrassus co\u00f6perated with Lucullus in this matter. Pompey was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindignant and made friends with C\u00e6sar and promised under oath to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport him for the consulship. The latter thereupon brought Crassus into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendly relations with Pompey. Thus these three most powerful men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated together for their mutual advantage. This coalition the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman writer Varro treated in a book entitled Tricaranus (the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree-headed monster). The Senate had its suspicions of them and elected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius Bibulus as C\u00e6sar's colleague to hold him in check. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Strife sprang up between them immediately and they proceeded to arm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves secretly against each other. C\u00e6sar, who was a master of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissimulation, made speeches in the Senate in the interest of harmony with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBibulus, as though he were taking care lest harm should come to the republic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom their disagreement. As he was believed to be sincere, Bibulus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrown off his guard. While Bibulus was unprepared and suspecting nothing,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar secretly got a large band of soldiers in readiness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought before the Senate measures for the relief of the poor by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribution of the public land to them. The best part of this land around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCapua, which was leased for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic benefit, he proposed to bestow upon those who were the fathers of at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleast three children, by which means he bought for himself the favor of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude of men. Twenty-thousand, who had three children each, came forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat once. As many senators opposed his motion he pretended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be indignant at their injustice, and rushed out of the Senate and did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvene it again for the remainder of the year, but harangued the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rostra. In a public assembly he asked Pompey and Crassus what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought about his proposed laws. Both gave their approval, and the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame to the voting-place carrying concealed daggers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Senate (since no one called it together and it was not lawful for one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul to do so without the consent of the other) assembled at the house of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBibulus, but did nothing to counteract the force and preparation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. They planned, however, that Bibulus should oppose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's laws, so that they should seem to be overcome by force\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than by their own negligence. Accordingly, Bibulus burst into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum while C\u00e6sar was still speaking. Strife and tumult arose,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblows were given, and those who had daggers broke the fasces and insignia of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBibulus and wounded some of the tribunes who stood around him. Bibulus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin no wise terrified, but bared his neck to C\u00e6sar's partisans and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloudly called on them to strike. \"If I cannot persuade C\u00e6sar to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright,\" he said, \"I will affix upon him the guilt and stigma of my death.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHis friends, however, led him, against his will, out of the crowd and into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe neighboring temple of Jupiter Stator. Cato was indignant at these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceedings, and, being a young man, forced his way to the midst of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowd and began to make a speech, but was lifted up and dragged out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's partisans. Then he went around secretly by another street\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand again mounted the rostra; but as he despaired of making a speech, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobody would listen to him, he abused C\u00e6sar roundly until he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tejected by the C\u00e6sarians, and C\u00e6sar secured the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenactment of his laws. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The plebeians swore to observe these laws forever, and C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirected the Senate to do the same. Many of them, including Cato, refused,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand C\u00e6sar proposed and the people enacted the death penalty to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecusants. Then they became alarmed and took the oath, including the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunes, for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno longer of any use to speak against it after the law had been confirmed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe others. And now Vettius, a plebeian, ran into the forum with a drawn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdagger and said that he had been sent by Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato to kill\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and Pompey, and that the dagger had been given to him by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPostumius, the lictor of Bibulus. Although this affair was open to suspicion\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton both sides, C\u00e6sar made use of it to inflame the multitude and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostponed the examination of the assailant. Vettius was thrown into prison\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand killed the same night. As this transaction was variously commented on,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar did not let it pass unnoticed, but said that it had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone by the opposite party who were afraid of exposure. Finally, the people furnished him a guard to protect him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst conspirators, and Bibulus abstained from public business altogether,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike a private citizen, and did not go out of his house for the remainder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this official term. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As C\u00e6sar now had the sole administration of public affairs, he did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot make any further inquiry concerning Vettius. He brought forward new laws\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto win the favor of the multitude, and caused all of Pompey's acts to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratified, as he had promised him. The so-called knights, who held the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace in rank between the Senate and the plebeians, and were extremely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful in all ways by reason of their wealth, and of the farming of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovincial revenues which they contracted for, and who kept for this purpose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitudes of very trusty servants, had been asking the Senate for a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime to release them from a part of what they owed to the treasury. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate was consuming time on this question. As C\u00e6sar did not want\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything of the Senate then, but was employing the people only, he released\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe publicans from a third part of their contracts. For this unexpected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavor, which was far beyond their deserts, the knights extolled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar to the skies. Thus a more powerful body of defenders than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of the plebeians was added to C\u00e6sar's support through one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical act. He gave spectacles and combats of wild beasts beyond his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans, borrowing money on all sides, and surpassing all former exhibitions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin lavish display and splendid gifts, in consequence of which he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed governor of both Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul for five years,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the command of four legions. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As C\u00e6sar saw that he would be away from home a long time, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that envy would be in proportion to benefits conferred, he gave his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter in marriage to Pompey, although she was betrothed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6pio, because he feared that even a friend might become envious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his great success. He promoted the boldest of his partisans to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprincipal offices for the ensuing year. He designated his friend Aulus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGabinius as consul, with Lucius Piso as his colleague, whose daughter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCalpurnia, C\u00e6sar married, although Cato cried out that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment was debauched by marriages. For tribunes he chose Vatinius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClodius Pulcher, although the latter had been suspected of an amour with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twife of C\u00e6sar himself during a religious ceremony of women, but whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar did not bring to trial because Clodius was very popular with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe masses; but he divorced his wife. Others prosecuted Clodius for impiety\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the sacred rites, and Cicero made the argument for the prosecution. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was called as a witness he refused to testify against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClodius, but even raised him to the tribuneship as a foil to Cicero who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready decrying the triumvirate as tending toward monarchy. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar turned a private grievance to useful account and benefited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone enemy in order to revenge himself on another. It appears, however, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClodius had previously requited C\u00e6sar by helping him to secure the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernorship of Gaul. \n\t\t\t\t"},"2":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such were the acts of C\u00e6sar's consulship. He then laid down his magistracy and proceeded directly to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew government. Clodius now brought an accusation against Cicero for putting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLentulus and Cethegus and their followers to death without trial. Cicero, who had exhibited the highest courage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin that transaction, became utterly unnerved at his trial. He put on coarse\n\t\t\t\t\t\traiment and, defiled with squalor and dirt, supplicated those whom he met in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe streets, not being ashamed to annoy people who knew nothing about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness, so that his doings excited laughter rather than pity by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this unseemly aspect. Into such trepidation did he fall at this single trial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his own, although he had been managing other people's causes successfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall his life. In like manner they say that Demosthenes the Athenian did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstand his ground when accused, but fled before the trial. When Clodius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterrupted Cicero's supplications on the streets with contumely, he gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway to despair and, like Demosthenes, went into voluntary exile. A multitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his friends went out of the city with him, and the Senate recommended him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the attention of cities, kings, and princes. Clodius demolished his house\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand his villas. Clodius was so much elated by this affair that he compared\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself with Pompey, who was then the most powerful man in Rome. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, Pompey held out to Milo, who was Clodius' colleague in office\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a bolder spirit than himself, the hope of the consulship, and incited\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim against Clodius, and directed him to procure a vote for the recall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero. He hoped that when Cicero should come back he would no longer speak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the existing status (the triumvirate), remembering what he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered, but would make trouble for Clodius and bring punishment upon him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThus Cicero, who had been exiled by means of Pompey, was recalled by means of Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout sixteen months after his banishment, and the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\trebuilt his house and his villas at the public expense. He was received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagnificently at the city gates. It is said that a whole day was consumed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe greetings extended to him, as was the case with Demosthenes when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime C\u00e6sar, who had performed the many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrilliant exploits in Gaul and Britain which have been described in my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeltic history, had returned with vast riches to Cisalpine Gaul on the river\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPo to give his army a short respite from continuous fighting. From this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace he sent large sums of money to many persons in Rome, to those who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholding the yearly offices and to persons otherwise distinguished as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernors and generals, and they went thither by turns to meet him. So many of them came that 120\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlictors could be seen around him at one time, and more than 200 senators,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome returning thanks for what they had already received, others asking for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney or seeking some other advantage for themselves from the same quarter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll things were now possible to C\u00e6sar by reason of his large army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\this great riches, and his readiness to oblige everybody. Pompey and Crassus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\this partners in the triumvirate, came also. In their conference it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided that Pompey and Crassus should be elected consuls again and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's governorship over his provinces should be extended for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive years more. Thereupon they separated and Domitius Ahenobarbus offered\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself as a candidate for the consulship against Pompey. When the appointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday came, both went down to the Campus Martius before daylight to attend the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomitia. Their followers got into an altercation and came to blows, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinally somebody assaulted the torchbearer of Domitius with a sword. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a scattering straightway, and Domitius escaped with difficulty to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town house. Even Pompey's clothing was carried home stained with blood, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat was the danger incurred by both candidates. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, Pompey and Crassus were chosen consuls and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's governorship was extended for five years according to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement. The provinces were allotted with an army to each consul in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing manner: Pompey chose Spain and Africa, but sent friends to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharge of them, he himself remaining in Rome. Crassus took Syria and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjacent country because he wanted a war with the Parthians, which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought would be easy as well as glorious and gainful. But when he took his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparture from the city there were many unfavorable omens, and the tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbade the war against the Parthians, who had done no wrong to the Romans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs he would not obey, they invoked public imprecations on him, which Crassus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarded; wherefore he perished in Parthia, together with his son of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame name, and his army, not quite 10,000 of whom, out of 100,000, escaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Syria. The disaster to Crassus will be described in my Parthian history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the Romans were suffering from scarcity, they appointed Pompey the sole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanager of the grain supply and gave him, as in his operations against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpirates, twenty assistants from the Senate. These he distributed in like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner among the provinces while he superintended the whole, and thus Rome\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas very soon provided with abundant supplies, by which means Pompey again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgained great reputation and power. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About this time the daughter of C\u00e6sar, who was married to Pompey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdied in childbirth, and fear fell upon all lest, with the termination of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis marriage connection, C\u00e6sar and Pompey with their great armies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould come into conflict with each other, especially as the commonwealth\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been for a long time disorderly and unmanageable. The magistrates were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen by means of money, and faction fights, with dishonest zeal, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taid of stones and even swords. Bribery and corruption prevailed in the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscandalous manner. The people themselves went to the elections to be bought.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA case was found where a deposit of 800 talents had been made to obtain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t consulship. The consuls holding office yearly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould not hope to lead armies or to command in war because they were shut\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout by the power of the triumvirate. The baser ones strove for gain, instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof military commands, at the expense of the public treasury or from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection of their own successors. For these reasons good men abstained from\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice altogether. The disorder was such that at one time the republic was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout consuls for eight months, Pompey conniving at the state of affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order that there might be need of a dictator. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Many citizens began to talk to each other about this, saying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the only remedy for existing evils was the one-man power, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was need of a man who combined strength of character and mildness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemper, thereby indicating Pompey, who had a sufficient army under his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand and who appeared to be both a friend of the people and a leader of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate by virtue of his rank, a man of temperance and self-control and\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasy of access, or at all events so considered. This expectation of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdictatorship Pompey discountenanced in words, but in fact he did everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly to promote it, and willingly overlooked the prevailing disorder and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe interregnum consequent upon it. Milo, who had assisted him in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontroversy with Clodius, and had acquired great popularity by the recall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero, now sought the consulship, as he considered it a favorable time in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of the present interregnum; but Pompey kept postponing the comitia until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMilo became disgusted, believing that Pompey was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalse to him, and withdrew to his native town of Lanuvium, which they say\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the first city founded in Italy by Diomedes on his return from Troy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is situated about 150 stades from Rome. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Clodius happened to be coming from his own country-seat on horseback and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmet Milo at Bovill\u00e6. They merely exchanged hostile scowls and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed along; but one of Milo's servants attacked Clodius, either because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas ordered to do so or because he wanted to kill his master's enemy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstabbed him through the back with a dagger. Clodius' groom carried him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbleeding into a neighboring inn. Milo followed with his servants and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinished him, -- whether he was still alive, or already dead, is not known,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-- for, although he claimed that he had neither advised nor ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilling, he was not willing to leave the deed unfinished because he knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would be accused in any event. When the news of this affair was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcirculated in Rome, the people were thunderstruck, and they passed the night\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the forum. When daylight came, the corpse of Clodius was displayed on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trostra. Some of the tribunes and the friends of Clodius and a great crowd\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith them seized it and carried it to the senate-house, either to confer\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonor upon it, as he was of senatorial birth, or as an act of contumely to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate for conniving at such deeds. There the more reckless ones\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected the benches and chairs of the senators and made a funeral pile for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, which they lighted and from which the senate-house and many buildings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the neighborhood caught fire and were consumed with the corpse of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClodius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was the hardihood of Milo that he was moved less by fear of punishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the murder than by indignation at the honor bestowed upon Clodius at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuneral. He collected a crowd of slaves and rustics, and, after sending some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney to be distributed among the people and buying Marcus C\u00e6lius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the tribunes, he came back to the city with the greatest boldness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDirectly he entered, C\u00e6lius dragged him to the forum to be tried\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby those whom he had bribed, as though by an assembly of the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretending to be very indignant and not willing to grant any delay, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\thoping that if those present should acquit him he would escape a more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregular trial. Milo said that the deed was not premeditated, since one would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot set out with such intentions encumbered with his luggage and his wife.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe remainder of his speech was directed against Clodius as a desperado and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta friend of desperadoes, who had set fire to the senate-house and burned it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ashes with his body. While he was still speaking the other tribunes, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unbribed portion of the people, burst into the forum armed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6lius and Milo escaped disguised as slaves, but there was a heavy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter of the others. Search was not made for the friends of Milo, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall who were met with, whether citizens or strangers, were killed, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially those who wore fine clothes and gold rings. As the government was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout order these ruffians, who were for the most part slaves and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmed men against unarmed, indulged their rage and, making an excuse of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttumult that had broken out, they turned to pillage. They abstained from no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrime, but broke into houses, looking for any kind of portable property, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretending to be searching for the friends of Milo. For several days Milo\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas their excuse for burning, stoning, and every sort of outrage. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Senate assembled in consternation and looked to Pompey, intending to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim dictator at once, for they considered this necessary as a cure for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent evils; but at the suggestion of Cato they appointed him consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout a colleague, so that by ruling alone he might have the power of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdictator with the responsibility of a consul. He was the first of consuls\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had two of the greatest provinces, and an army, and the public money,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the one-man power in the city, by virtue of being sole consul. In order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Cato might not cause obstruction by his presence, it was decreed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the should go to Cyprus and take the island away from King Ptolemy--a law to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat effect having been enacted by Clodius because once, when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured by pirates, the avaricious Ptolemy contributed only two talents for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this ransom. When Ptolemy heard of the decree he threw his money into the sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand killed himself, and Cato settled the government of Cyprus. Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the prosecution of offenders and especially of those guilty of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbribery and corruption. He thought that the seat of the public disorder was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere, and that by beginning there he should effect a speedy cure. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought forward a law, that any citizen who chose to do so might call for an\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounting from anybody who had held office from the time of his own first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship to the present. This embraced a period of a little less than\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty years, during which C\u00e6sar also had been consul; wherefore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's friends suspected that he included so long a time in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto cast reproach and contumely on C\u00e6sar, and urged him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraighten out the present crookedness rather than stir up the past to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannoyance of so many distinguished men, among whom they named\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. Pompey pretended to be indignant at the mention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's name, as though he were above suspicion, and said that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town second consulship was embraced in the period, and that he had reached\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback a considerable time in order to effect a complete cure of the evils\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom which the republic had been so long wasting away. \n\t\t\t\t"},"3":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After making this answer he passed his law, and straightway there ensued a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat number and variety of prosecutions. In order that the jurors might act\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout fear Pompey stationed soldiers around them and superintended them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson. The first ones convicted were absentees: Milo for the murder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClodius; Gabinius both for violation of law and for impiety, because he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvaded Egypt without a decree of the Senate and contrary to the Sibylline\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbooks; Hyps\u00e6us, Memmius, Sextius, and many others for bribery and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor corrupting the populace. The people interceded for Scaurus, but Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade proclamation that they should wait for the decision of the court. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe crowd again interrupted the accusers, Pompey's soldiers made a charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand killed several. Then the people held their tongues and Scaurus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvicted. All of them were banished. Gabinius was fined in addition. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate praised Pompey highly for these proceedings, voted him two more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, and extended the term of his provincial government. As Pompey's law\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffered impunity to any one who should turn state's evidence, Memmius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been convicted of bribery, called Lucius Scipio, the father-in-law of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey himself, to trial for like participation in bribery. Thereupon Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput on mourning and many of the jurors did the same. Memmius took pity on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe republic and withdrew the accusation. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey, as though he had completed the reforms that made the one-man power\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, now made Scipio his colleague in the consulship for the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the year. At the expiration of his term, however, although others were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested with the consulship, he was none the less the supervisor, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\truler, and all-in-all in Rome. He enjoyed the good-will of the Senate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly because they were jealous of C\u00e6sar, who did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsult the Senate during his consulship, and because Pompey had so speedily\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestored the sick commonwealth, and had not made himself troublesome or\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffensive to any of them during his term of office. The banished ones went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto C\u00e6sar in crowds and advised him to beware of Pompey, saying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat his law about bribery was especially directed against himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar cheered them up and spoke well of Pompey. He also induced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tribunes to bring in a law to enable himself to stand for the consulship\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta second time while absent, and this was enacted while Pompey was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul and without opposition from him. C\u00e6sar suspected that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate would resist this project and feared lest he should be reduced to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition of a private citizen and exposed to his enemies. So he tried to retain his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower until he should be elected consul, and asked the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate to grant him a little more time in his present command of Gaul, or of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta part of it. Marcellus, who succeeded Pompey as consul, forbade it. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay that when this was announced to C\u00e6sar, he clapped his hand on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this sword-hilt and exclaimed, \"This shall give it to me.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar built the town of Novum Comum at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe foot of the Alps and gave it the Latin rights, which included a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovision that those who had exercised the yearly chief magistracy should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman citizens. One of these men, who had held this office and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequently considered a Roman citizen, was beaten with rods for some\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason by order of Marcellus in defiance of C\u00e6sar--a punishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was never inflicted on Roman citizens. Marcellus in his passion\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevealed his real intention that the blows should be the marks of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeigner, and he told the man to carry his scars and show them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. So insulting was Marcellus. Moreover, he proposed to send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessors to take command of C\u00e6sar's provinces before his time\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad expired, but Pompey interfered, making a pretence of fairness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood-will, saying that they ought not to put an indignity on a distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman who had been so extremely useful to his country, merely on account of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort interval of time; but he made it plain that C\u00e6sar's command\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust come to an end immediately on its expiration. For this reason the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbitterest enemies of C\u00e6sar were chosen consuls for the ensuing year: \u00c6milius Paulus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClaudius Marcellus, cousin of the Marcellus before mentioned. Curio, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso a bitter enemy of C\u00e6sar, but extremely popular with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmasses and a most accomplished speaker, was chosen tribune. C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not able to influence Claudius with money, but he bought the neutrality\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Paulus for 1500 talents and the assistance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurio with a still larger sum, because he knew that the latter was heavily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburdened with debt. With the money thus obtained Paulus built and dedicated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Roman people the Basilica that bears his name, a very beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Curio, in order that he might not be detected changing sides too suddenly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought forward vast plans for repairing and building roads, of which he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be superintendent for five years. He knew that he could not carry any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch measure, but he hoped that Pompey's friends would oppose him so that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have that as an excuse for opposing Pompey. Things turned out as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad anticipated, so that he had a pretext for disagreement. Claudius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the sending of successors to take command of C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, as his term was now expiring. Paulus was silent. Curio, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought to differ from both, praised the motion of Claudius, but added that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey ought to resign his provinces and army just like C\u00e6sar, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this way he said the commonwealth would be made free and be relieved from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear in all directions. Many opposed this as unjust, because Pompey's term\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not yet expired. Then Curio came out more openly and decidedly against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointing successors to C\u00e6sar unless Pompey also should lay down\n\t\t\t\t\t\this command; for since they were both suspicious of each other, he contended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there could be no lasting peace to the commonwealth unless both were\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduced to the character of private citizens. He said this because he knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Pompey would not give up his command and because he saw that the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere incensed against Pompey on account of his prosecutions for bribery. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurio's position was plausible, the plebeians praised him as the only one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was willing to incur the enmity of both Pompey and C\u00e6sar in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to fulfil worthily his duties as a citizen; and once they escorted him\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome like an athlete, scattering flowers, as though he had won the prize in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome great and difficult contest, for nothing was considered more perilous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen than to have a difference with Pompey. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey, while lying sick in Italy, wrote an artful letter to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, praising C\u00e6sar's exploits and also recounting his own from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning, saying that he had been invested with a third consulship, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith provinces and an army afterward, which he had not solicited, but had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen called to serve the public weal. He added that the powers which he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccepted unwillingly he would gladly yield to those who wished to take them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback, and would not wait the time fixed for their expiration. The artfulness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this communication consisted in showing the fairness of Pompey and in\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting prejudice against C\u00e6sar, as though the latter was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twilling to give up his command even at the appointed time. When Pompey came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback to the city, he spoke to the senators in the same way and then, also,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to lay down his command. As a friend and marriage connection of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar he said that the latter would very cheerfully do the same,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor his had been a long and laborious contest against very warlike peoples;\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had added much to the Roman power and now he would come back to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors and his sacrificings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake his rest. He said these things in order that successors to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar might be sent at once, while he (Pompey) should merely stand\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton his promise. Curio exposed his artifice, saying that promises were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient, and insisting that Pompey should lay down his command now and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat C\u00e6sar should not be disarmed until Pompey himself had\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to private life. On account of private enmity, he said, it would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be advisable either for C\u00e6sar or for the Romans that such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat authority should be held by one man. Rather should each of them have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower against the other in case one should attempt violence against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommonwealth. Throwing off all disguise, he denounced Pompey unsparingly as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone aiming at supreme power, and said that unless he would lay down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand now, when he had the fear of C\u00e6sar before his eyes, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould never lay it down at all. He moved that, unless they both obeyed, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be voted public enemies and military forces be levied against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this way he concealed the fact that he had been bought by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey was angry with him and threatened him and at once withdrew indignantly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his country-seat. The Senate now had suspicions of both, but it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered Pompey the better republican of the two, and it hated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar because he had not shown it proper respect during his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship. Some of the senators really thought that it would not be safe to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe commonwealth to deprive Pompey of his power until after C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould lay down his, since the latter was outside of the city and was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman of more towering designs. Curio held the contrary opinion, that they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed of C\u00e6sar against the power of Pompey, or otherwise that both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies should be disbanded at the same time. As the Senate would not agree\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him he dismissed it, leaving the whole business still unfinished. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad the power to do so as tribune. Thus Pompey had occasion to regret that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had restored the tribunician power to its pristine vigor after it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reduced to extreme feebleness by Sulla. Nevertheless, one decree was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted before the session was ended, and that was that C\u00e6sar and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey should each send one legion of soldiers to Syria to defend the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince on account of the disaster to Crassus. Pompey artfully recalled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe legion that he had lately lent to C\u00e6sar on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster to C\u00e6sar's two generals, Titurius and Cotta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar awarded to each soldier 250 drachmas and sent the legion to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome together with another of his own. As the expected danger did not show\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself in Syria, these legions were sent into winter quarters at Capua. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The persons who had been sent by Pompey to C\u00e6sar to bring these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions spread many reports derogatory to C\u00e6sar and repeated them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pompey. They said that C\u00e6sar's army was wasted by protracted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice, that the soldiers longed for their homes and would change to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of Pompey as soon as they should cross the Alps. They spoke in this way\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither from ignorance or because they were corrupted. In fact, every soldier\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas strongly attached to C\u00e6sar and labored zealously for him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder the force of discipline and the influence of the gain which war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tusually brings to victors and which they received from C\u00e6sar also;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor he gave with ar lavish hand in order to mould them to his designs. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknew what his designs were, but they stood by him nevertheless. Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved what was reported to him and collected neither soldiers nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparatus suitable for so great a contest. In the Senate the opinion of each member\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas asked and Claudius craftily divided the question and took the votes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseparately, thus: \"Shall successors be sent to C\u00e6sar?\" and again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Shall Pompey be deprived of his command?\" The majority voted against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter proposition, and it was decreed that successors to C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be sent. Then Curio put the question whether both should lay down\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir commands, and 22 senators voted in the negative while 370 went back to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe opinion of Curio in order to avoid civil discord. Then Claudius dismissed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, exclaiming, \"Enjoy your victory and have C\u00e6sar for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Suddenly a false rumor came that C\u00e6sar had crossed the Alps and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarching on the city, whereupon there was a great tumult and consternation\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton all sides. Claudius moved that the army at Capua be turned against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar as a public enemy. When Curio opposed him on the ground that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rumor was false he exclaimed, \"If I am prevented by the vote of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate from taking steps for the public safety, I will take such steps on my\n\t\t\t\t\t\town responsibility as consul.\" After saying this he darted out of the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand proceeded to the suburbs with his colleague, where he presented a sword\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pompey, and said, \"I and my colleague command you to march against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar in behalf of your country, and we give you for this purpose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army now at Capua, or in any other part of Italy, and whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional forces you yourself choose to levy.\" Pompey promised to obey the\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders of the consuls, but he added, \"unless we can do better,\" thus dealing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin trickery and still making a pretence of fairness. Curio had no power\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutside of the city (for it was not permitted to the tribunes to go beyond\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls), but he publicly deplored the state of affairs and demanded that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls should make proclamation that nobody need obey the conscription\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered by Pompey. As he could accomplish nothing, and as his term of office\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas tribune was about expiring, and he feared for his safety and despaired of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing able to render any further assistance to C\u00e6sar, he hastily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparted to join the latter. \n\t\t\t\t"},"4":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar had lately recrossed the straits from Britain and, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraversing the Gallic country along the Rhine, had passed the Alps with 5000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot and 300 horse and arrived at Ravenna, which was contiguous to Italy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe last town in his government. After embracing Curio and returning thanks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor what he had done for him, he looked over the present situation. Curio\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvised him to bring his whole army together now and lead it to Rome, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar thought it best still to try and come to terms. So he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirected his friends to make an agreement in his behalf, that he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliver up all his provinces and soldiers, except that he should retain two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions and Illyria with Cisalpine Gaul until he should be chosen consul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was satisfactory to Pompey, but the consuls refused. C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen wrote a letter to the Senate, which Curio carried a distance of 1300 stades in three days and delivered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe newly elected consuls as they entered the senate-house on the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalends of January. The letter embraced a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalm recital of all that C\u00e6sar had done from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of his career and a proposal that he would lay down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand at the same time with Pompey, but that if Pompey should retain his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand he would not lay down his own, but would come quickly and avenge his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry's wrongs and his own. When this letter was read, as it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered a declaration of war, a vehement shout was raised on all sides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Lucius Domitius be appointed as C\u00e6sar's successor. Domitius\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook the field immediately with 4000 of the new levies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Antony and Cassius, who succeeded Curio as tribunes, agreed with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter in opinion, the Senate became more bitter than ever and declared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey's army the protector of Rome, and that of C\u00e6sar a public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy. The consuls, Marcellus and Lentulus, ordered Antony and his friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of the Senate lest they should suffer some harm, although they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunes. Then Antony sprang from his chair in anger and with a loud voice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled gods and men to witness the indignity put upon the sacred and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinviolable office of tribune, saying that while they (the tribunes) were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpressing the opinion which they deemed conducive to the public interest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were driven out with contumely though they had wrought no murder or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother outrage. Having spoken thus he rushed out like one possessed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpredicting war, slaughter, proscription, banishment, confiscation, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious other impending evils, and invoking direful curses on the authors of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Curio and Cassius rushed out with him, for a detachment of Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy was already observed standing around the senate-house. The tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade their way to C\u00e6sar the next night with the utmost speed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealing themselves in a hired carriage, and disguised as slaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar showed them in this condition to his army, whom he excited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby saying that his soldiers, after all their great deeds, had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstigmatized as public enemies and that distinguished men like these, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdared to speak out for them, had been thus driven with ignominy from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcity. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The war had now been begun on both sides and already openly declared. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, thinking that C\u00e6sar's army would be slow in arriving from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul and that he would not rush into so great an adventure with a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce, directed Pompey to assemble 130,000 Italian soldiers, chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveterans who had had experience in war, and to recruit as many able-bodied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen as possible from the neighboring provinces. They voted him for the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall the money in the public treasury at once, and their own private fortunes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin addition if they should be needed for the pay of the soldiers. With the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfury of party rage they levied additional contributions on the allied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities, which they collected with the greatest possible haste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had sent messengers to bring his own army, but as he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccustomed to rely upon the terror caused by the celerity and audacity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this movements, rather than on the magnitude of his preparations, he decided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take the aggressive in this great war with his 5000 men and to anticipate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy by seizing the advantageous positions in Italy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, he sent forward some centurions with a few of his bravest troops\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin peaceful garb to go inside the walls of Ariminum and take it by surprise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was the first town in Italy after leaving Cisalpine Gaul. Toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevening C\u00e6sar himself rose from a banquet on a plea of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindisposition, leaving some friends who were still feasting. He mounted his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchariot and drove toward Ariminum, his cavalry following at a short\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance. When his course brought him to the river Rubicon, which forms the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboundary line of Italy, he stopped and, while gazing at the stream, revolved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his mind the evils that might result from his crossing it with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecovering himself he said to those who were present, \"My friends, stopping\n\t\t\t\t\t\there will be the beginning of sorrows for me; crossing over will be such for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall mankind.\" Thereupon, he crossed with a rush like one inspired, uttering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe common phrase, \"Let the die be cast.\" Then he resumed his hasty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjourney and took possession of Ariminum about daybreak, advanced beyond it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed guards at the commanding positions, and, either by force or by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkindness, mastered all whom he fell in with. As is usual in cases of panic,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was flight and migration from all the country-side in disorder and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttears, the people having no exact knowledge, but thinking that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had arrived with an army of boundless strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the consuls learned the facts they did not allow Pompey to act according\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his own judgment, experienced as he was in military affairs, but urged\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to traverse Italy and raise troops, as though the city were on the point\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof being captured. The Senate also was alarmed at C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunexpectedly swift advance, for which it was still unprepared, and in its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpanic repented that it had not accepted C\u00e6sar's proposals, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit considered just at last, after fear had turned it from party rage to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounsels of prudence. Many portents and signs in the sky took place. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\trained blood. Sweat issued from the statues of the gods. Lightning struck\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral temples. A mule gave birth to a colt. There were many other prodigies\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich betokened an overturn and change in the form of government for all\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. Prayers were offered up in public as was customary in times of danger,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the people who remembered the evil times of Marius and Sulla, clamored\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat both C\u00e6sar and Pompey ought to lay down their commands as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly means of averting war. Cicero proposed to send messengers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar in order to come to an arrangement. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As the consuls opposed all accommodation Favonius, in ridicule of Pompey for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething he had said a little before, advised him to stamp on the ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his foot and raise armies in that way. \"You can have them,\" replied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey, \"if you will follow me and not consider it such a terrible thing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleave Rome, and Italy also if need be.

The other senators remained undecided a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong time and passed the night together in the senate-house. At daybreak,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, most of them departed and hastened after Pompey. \n\t\t\t\t"},"5":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At Corfinium C\u00e6sar came up with and besieged Lucius Domitius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been sent to be his successor in the command of Gaul but who did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave all of his 4000 men with him. The inhabitants of Corfinium captured him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the gates, as he was trying to escape, and brought him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter received the soldiers of Domitius, who offered themselves to him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith kindness, in order to encourage others to join him, and he allowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomitius to go unharmed wherever he liked, and to take his money with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim. He hoped perhaps that Domitius would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstay with him on account of this beneficence, but he did not prevent him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom joining Pompey. While these transactions were taking place so swiftly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey hastened from Capua to Luceria and thence to Brundusium in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcross the Adriatic to Epirus and complete his preparations for war there. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrote letters to all the provinces and the commanders thereof, to princes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkings, and cities to send aid for carrying on the war with the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible speed, and this they did zealously. Pompey's own army was in Spain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready to move wherever it might be needed. Pompey gave some of the legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\the already had in Italy to the consuls to be moved from Brundusium to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEpirus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The consuls crossed safely to Dyrrachium, which some persons, by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe following error, consider the same as Epidamnus. A barbarian king of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregion, Epidamnus by name, built a city on the sea-coast and named it after\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself. Dyrrachus, the son of his daughter and of Neptune (as is supposed),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadded a dockyard to it which he named Dyrrachium. When the brothers of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDyrrachus made war against him, Hercules, who was returning from Erythea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed an alliance with him for a part of his territory; wherefore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDyrrachians claim Hercules as their founder because he had a share of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland, not that they repudiate Dyrrachus, but because they pride themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Hercules even more as a god. In the battle which took place it is said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Hercules killed Ionius, the son of Dyrrachus, by mistake, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter performing the funeral rites he threw the body into the sea in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it might bear his name. At a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater period the Briges, returning from Phrygia, took possession of the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the surrounding country. They were supplanted by the Taulantii, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIllyrian tribe, who were displaced in their turn by the Liburnians, another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIllyrian tribe, who were in the habit of making piratical expeditions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst their neighbors, with very swift ships. Hence the Romans call swift\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships liburnic\u0153, because these were the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones they came in conflict with. The people who had been expelled from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDyrrachium by the Liburnians procured the aid of the Corcyreans, who then\n\t\t\t\t\t\truled the sea, and drove out the Liburnians. The Corcyreans mingled their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town colonists with them and thus it came to be considered a Greek port; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Corcyreans changed its name, because they considered it unpropitious,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand called it Epidamnus from the town just above it, and Thucydides gives it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat name also. Nevertheless, the former name prevailed finally and it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow called Dyrrachium. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t A portion of Pompey's forces had crossed to Dyrrachium with the consuls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey led the remainder to Brundusium, where he awaited the return of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships that had carried the others over. Here C\u00e6sar advanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him, and he defended himself by walls and dug trenches in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcity until his fleet came back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen he took his departure in the early evening, leaving the bravest of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops on the walls. These also sailed away after nightfall, with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavorable wind. Thus Pompey and his whole army abandoned Italy and passed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover to Epirus. C\u00e6sar, seeing the general drift of public opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward Pompey, was at a loss which way to turn or from what point to begin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe war. As he had apprehensions of Pompey's army in Spain, which was large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand well disciplined by long service (lest while he was pursuing Pompey it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould fall upon his rear), he decided to march to Spain and destroy that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy first. He now divided his forces into five parts, one of which he left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Brundusium, another at Hydrus, and another at Tarentum to guard Italy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother he sent under command of Quintus Valerius to take possession of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrain-producing island of Sardinia, which he did. He sent Asinius Pollio to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, which was then under the command of Cato. When Cato asked him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether he had brought the order of the Senate, or that of the people, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake possession of a government that had been assigned to another, Pollio\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplied, \"The master of Italy has sent me on this business.\" Cato answered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat in order to spare the lives of those under his command he would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake resistance there. He then sailed away to Corcyra and from Corcyra to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar hastened to Rome.

In proof of his kindness to his enemies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the said that he had taken Lucius Domitius prisoner and allowed him to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway unharmed with his money. Nevertheless, he broke the bolts of the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreasury, and when Metellus, one of the tribunes, tried to prevent him from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentering, threatened him with death. He took away money hitherto untouched,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich, they say, had been deposited there long ago, at the time of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGallic invasion, with a public curse upon anybody who should take it out\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept in case of a war with the Gauls. C\u00e6sar said that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjugated the Gauls completely and thus released the commonwealth from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurse. He then placed \u00c6milius Lepidus in charge of the city, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tribune, Mark Antony, in charge of Italy and of the army guarding it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutside of Italy he chose Curio to take command of Sicily in place of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCato, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQuintus Valerius for Sardinia. He sent Gaius Antonius to Illyria and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrusted Cisalpine Gaul to Licinius Crassus. He ordered the building of two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleets with all speed, one in the Adriatic and the other in the Tyrrhenian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea, and appointed Hortensius and Dolabella their admirals while they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill under construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having prevailed so far as to make Italy inaccessible to Pompey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar went to Spain, where he encountered Petreius and Afranius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey's lieutenants, and was worsted by them at first and afterward had an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindecisive engagement with them near the town of Ilerda. He pitched his camp on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome high ground and obtained his supplies by means of a bridge across the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver Sicoris. Suddenly a freshet of melting snow carried away his bridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand cut off a great number of his men on the opposite side. These were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed by the forces of Petreius. C\u00e6sar himself, with the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his army, suffered very severely from the difficulty of the place, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\thunger, from the weather, and from the enemy, his situation being in no wise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from that of a siege. Finally, on the approach of summer, Afranius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Petreius withdrew to the interior of Spain to recruit more soldiers, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar continually anticipated them, blocked their passage, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevented their advance. He also surrounded one of their divisions that had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen sent forward to capture his camp. They raised their shields over their\n\t\t\t\t\t\theads in token of surrender, but C\u00e6sar neither captured nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughtered them, but allowed them to go back to Afranius unharmed, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\this usual manner of winning the favor of his enemies. Whence it came to pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was continual intercourse between the camps and talk of\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciliation among the rank and file. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t To Afranius and some of the other officers it now seemed best to abandon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain to C\u00e6sar, provided they could go unharmed to Pompey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPetreius opposed this and ran through the camp killing those of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's men whom he found holding communication with his own. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven slew with his own hand one of his officers who tried to restrain him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoved by these acts of severity on the part of Petreius, the minds of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers were still more attracted to the clemency of C\u00e6sar. Soon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafterward C\u00e6sar managed to cut off the enemy's access to water,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Petreius was compelled by necessity to come with Afranius to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconference with C\u00e6sar between the two armies. Here it was agreed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they should abandon Spain to C\u00e6sar, and that he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconduct them unharmed to the other side of the river Varus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow them to proceed thence to Pompey. Arrived at this stream,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar called a meeting of all those who were from Rome or Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand addressed them as follows: \" My enemies (for by still using this term I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall make my meaning clearer to you), I did not destroy those of you who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrendered to me when you had been sent to seize my camp, nor the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour army when I had cut you off from water, although Petreius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously slaughtered those of my men who were intercepted on the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the river Sicoris. If there is any gratitude among you for these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavors tell them to all of Pompey's soldiers.\" After speaking thus he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdismissed them uninjured, and he appointed Quintus Cassius governor of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain. So much for the operations of C\u00e6sar. \n\t\t\t\t"},"6":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Attius Varus commanded the Pompeian forces in Africa, and Juba, king of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMauritanian Numidians, was in alliance with him. Curio sailed from Sicily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst them in behalf of C\u00e6sar with two legions, twelve war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvessels, and a number of ships of burden. He landed at Utica and put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight a body of Numidian horse in a small cavalry engagement near that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, and allowed himself to be saluted as Imperator by the soldiers with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir arms still in their hands. This title is an honor conferred upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals by their soldiers, who thus testify that they consider them worthy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be their commanders. In the olden time the generals accepted this honor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly for the greatest exploits. At present I understand that the distinction\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis limited to cases where at least 10,000 of the enemy have been killed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Curio was crossing from Sicily the inhabitants of Africa thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, in emulation of the glory of Scipio, he would establish his quarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnear the camp of the latter, poisoned the water in the neighborhood. Their\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation was fulfilled. Curio encamped there and his army immediately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell sick. When they drank the water their eyesight became dim as in a mist,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sleep with torpor ensued, and after that frequent vomiting and spasms of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole body. For this reason Curio changed his camp to the neighborhood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Utica itself, leading his enfeebled army through an extensive marshy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregion. But when they received the news of C\u00e6sar's victory in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain they took courage and put themselves in order of battle in a narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspace along the seashore. Here a severe battle was fought in which Curio\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost only one man, while Varus lost 600 killed, besides a still larger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber wounded. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Meantime, while Juba was advancing a false report preceded him, that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned back at the river Bagradas, which was not far distant, because his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkingdom had been invaded by his neighbors, and that he had left Saburra, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, with a small force at the river. Curio believed this report and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the third hour of a hot summer day led the greater part of his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Saburra by a sandy road destitute of water; for even if there were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany streams there in winter they were now dried up by the heat of the sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe found the river in possession of Saburra and of the king himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDisappointed in his expectation Curio retreated to some hills, oppressed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfatigue, heat, and thirst. When the enemy beheld him in this condition they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrossed the river prepared for fight. Curio despised the danger and very\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprudently led his enfeebled army down to the plain, where he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded by the Numidian horse. Here for some time he sustained the attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby retiring slowly and drawing his men together into a small space, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing much distressed he retreated again to the hills. Asinius Pollio, at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the trouble, had retreated with a small force to the camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Utica lest Varus should make an attack upon it as soon as he should hear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe news of the disaster at the river. Curio perished fighting bravely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with all his men, not one returning to Utica after Pollio. Such was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe result of the battle at the river Bagradas. Curio's head was cut off and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried to Juba. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the news of this disaster reached the camp at Utica, Flamma, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmiral, fled, fleet and all, not taking a single one of the land forces on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboard, but Pollio rowed out in a small boat to the merchant ships that were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlying at anchor near by and besought them to come to the shore and take the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy on board. Some of them did so by night. The soldiers came aboard in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch crowds that some of the small boats were sunk. Of those who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried out to sea, and who had money with them, many were thrown overboard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the merchants for the sake of the money. So much for those who put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea, but similar calamities, while it was still night, befell those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained on shore. At daybreak they surrendered themselves to Varus, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuba came up and, having collected them under the walls, put them all to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsword, claiming that they were the remainder of his victory, and paying no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention to the remonstrances of even Varus. Thus the two Roman legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat sailed to Africa with Curio were totally destroyed, together with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcavalry, the light-armed troops, and the servants belonging to the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuba, after vaunting his great exploit to Pompey, returned home. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t About this time [Gaius] Antonius was defeated in Illyria by Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlieutenant, Octavius, and another army of C\u00e6sar mutinied at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlacentia, crying out against their officers for prolonging the war and not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaying them the five min\u00e6 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat C\u00e6sar had promised them as a donative while they were still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Brundusium. When C\u00e6sar heard of this he flew from Massilia to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlacentia and coming before the soldiers, who were still in a state of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmutiny, addressed them as follows: \" You know what kind of speed I use in\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything I undertake. This war is not prolonged by us, but by the enemy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho have fled from us. You reaped great advantages from my command in Gaul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand you took an oath to me for the whole of this war and not for a part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly; and now you abandon us in the midst of our labors, you revolt against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour officers, you propose to give orders to those from whom you are bound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto receive orders. Being myself the witness of my liberality to you\n\t\t\t\t\t\theretofore I shall now execute the law of our country by decimating the ninth legion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere this mutiny began.\" Straightway a cry went up from the whole legion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the officers threw themselves at C\u00e6sar's feet in supplication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar yielded little by little and so far remitted the punishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas to designate 120 only (who seemed to have been the leaders of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevolt), and chose twelve of these by lot to be put to death. One of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwelve proved that he was absent when the conspiracy was formed, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar put to death in his stead the centurion who had accused him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After thus quelling the mutiny at Placentia C\u00e6sar proceeded to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome, where the trembling people chose him dictator without any decree of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate and without the intervention of a magistrate. But he, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprecating the office as likely to prove invidious or not desiring it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter holding it only eleven days (as some say) designated himself and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPublius Isauricus as consuls. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed or changed the governors of provinces according to his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpleasure. He assigned Marcus Lepidus to Spain, Aulus Albinius to Sicily,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSextus Peduc\u00e6us to Sardinia, and Decimus Brutus to the newly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquired Gaul. He distributed corn to the suffering people and at their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpetition he allowed the return of all exiles except Milo. When he was asked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto decree an abolition of debts, on the ground that the wars and seditions\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad caused a fall of prices, he refused it, but appointed appraisers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvendible goods which debtors might give to their creditors instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis had been done, about the winter solstice, he sent for his whole army to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendezvous at Brundusium and he himself took his departure in the month of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember, according to the Roman calendar, not waiting for the beginning of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this consulship on the calends of the new year, which was close at hand. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople followed him to the city gates, urging him to come to an arrangement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Pompey, for it was evident that whichever of them should conquer would\n\t\t\t\t\t\twield sovereign power. C\u00e6sar departed on his journey and travelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith all possible speed. \n\t\t\t\t"},"7":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime Pompey was using all diligence to build ships and collect\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional forces of men and money. He captured forty of C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships in the Adriatic and guarded against his crossing. He disciplined his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy and took part in the exercises of both infantry and cavalry, and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforemost in everything, notwithstanding his age. In this way he readily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgained the good-will of his soldiers; and the people flocked to see Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary drills as to a spectacle. C\u00e6sar at that time had ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions of infantry and 10,000 Gallic horse. Pompey had five legions from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly, with which he had crossed the Adriatic, and the cavalry belonging to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem; also the two surviving legions that had served with Crassus in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParthian war and a certain part of those who had made the incursion into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt with Gabinius, making altogether eleven legions of Italian troops and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 7000 horse. He had auxiliaries also from Ionia, Macedonia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeloponnesus, and B\u0153otia, Cretan archers, Thracian slingers, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPontic javelin-throwers. He had also some Gallic horse and others from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGalatia in the east, together with Commageneans sent by Antiochus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCilicians, Cappadocians, some from Lesser Armenia, also Pamphylians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPisidians. Pompey did not intend to use all these for fighting. Some were\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployed in garrison duty, in building fortifications, and in other service\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Italian soldiers, so that none of the latter should be kept away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the battles. Such were Pompey's land forces. He had 600 war-ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperfectly equipped, of which about 100 were manned by Romans and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstood to be much superior to the rest. He also had a great number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransports and ships of burthen. There were numerous naval commanders for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe different divisions, and Marcus Bibulus had the chief command over all. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When all was in readiness Pompey called the senators, the knights, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole army to an assembly and addressed them as follows: \"Fellow-soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Athenians, too, abandoned their city for the sake of liberty when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere fighting against invasion, because they believed that it was not houses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat made a city, but men; and after they had done so they presently\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovered it and made it more renowned than even before. So, too, our own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancestors abandoned the city when the Gauls invaded it, and Camillus hasted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Ardea and recovered it. All men of sound mind think that their country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis wherever they can preserve their liberty. Because we were thus minded we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed hither, not as deserters of our native land, but in order to prepare\n\t\t\t\t\t\tourselves to defend it gloriously against one who has long conspired against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, and, by means of bribe-takers, has at last seized Italy by a sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvasion, and whom you have decreed a public enemy. He now sends governors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take charge of your provinces. He appoints others over the city and still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers throughout Italy. With such audacity has he deprived the people of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own government. If he does these things while the war is still raging\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand while he is apprehensive of the result and when we intend, with a god's\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelp, to bring him to punishment, what cruelty, what violence is he likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto abstain from if he wins the victory? And while he is doing these things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the fatherland certain men, who have been bought with money that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobtained from our province of Gaul, co\u00f6perate with him, choosing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe his slaves instead of his equals. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"I have not failed and I never will fail to fight with you and for you. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive you my services both as soldier and as general. If I have had any\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience in war, if it has been my good fortune to remain unvanquished to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis day, I pray the gods to continue all these blessings in our present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed and that I may become a man of destiny for my country in her perils as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI was in extending her dominion. Surely we may trust in the gods and in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trighteousness of the war, which has for its noble and just object the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefence of our country's constitution. In addition to this we may rely upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe magnitude of the preparations which we behold on land and sea, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall the time growing and will be augmented still more as soon as we come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto action.

Come to your task then with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit worthy of your country, of yourselves, and of me, mindful of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrongs you have received from C\u00e6sar, and ready to obey my orders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromptly.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Pompey had thus spoken the whole army, including the senators and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat many of the nobility who were with him, applauded him vociferously and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttold him to lead them wherever he would. Pompey thought that as the weather\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas bad and the sea boisterous C\u00e6sar would not attempt to cross\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttill the end of winter, but would be occupied in the meantime with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduties as consul. So he ordered his naval officers to keep watch of the sea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then divided his army and sent it into winter quarters in Thessaly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia. So heedlessly did Pompey form his judgment of what was about to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake place. C\u00e6sar, as I have already said, hastened to Brundusium\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the winter solstice, intending to strike terror into his enemies by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking them by surprise. Although he found neither provisions, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparatus, nor his whole army collected at Brundusium, he, nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled those who were present to an assembly and addressed them as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Fellow-soldiers,--you who are joined with me in the greatest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertakings,--neither the winter weather, nor the delay of our comrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor the want of suitable preparation shall check my onset. I consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidity of movement the best substitute for all these things. I think that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe who are first at the rendezvous should leave behind us here our servants,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour pack-animals, and all our apparatus in order that the ships which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\there may take us on board and carry us over at once without the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge. Let us oppose our good fortune to the winter weather, our courage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the smallness of our numbers, and to our want of supplies the abundance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the enemy, which will be ours to take as soon as we touch the land, if we\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealize that nothing is ours unless we conquer. Let us go then and possess\n\t\t\t\t\t\tourselves of their servants, their apparatus, their provisions, while they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare spending the winter under cover. Let us go while Pompey thinks that I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending my time in winter quarters also, or in processions and sacrifices\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappertaining to my consulship. It is needless to tell you that the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpotent thing in war is the unexpected.

For my part I would rather\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow be sailing than talking, so that I may come in Pompey's sight while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthinks me engaged in my official duties at Rome.

It was now the winter solstice and the wind kept him back,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his will, and held him in Brundusium, to his great disappointment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil the first day of the new year. In the meantime two more legions arrived and C\u00e6sar embarked these also and started in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter time on merchant ships, for he had only a few war-ships and these\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere guarding Sardinia and Sicily. The ships were driven by the winds to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeraunian Mountains and C\u00e6sar sent them back immediately to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rest of the army. He then marched by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight against the town of Oricum by a rough and narrow path, with his force\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided in several parts on account of the difficulties of the road, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif his army had been anticipated he might have been easily beaten. With much\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrouble he got his detachments together about daylight and the commander of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe garrison of Oricum, having been forbidden by the townsmen to oppose the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance of a Roman consul, delivered the keys of the place to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and remained with him in a position of honor. Lucretius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMinucius, who were on the other side of Oricum with eighteen war-ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguarding merchant ships loaded with corn for Pompey, sunk the latter to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevent them from falling into C\u00e6sar's hands, and fled to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDyrrachium. From Oricum C\u00e6sar hastened to Apollonia, the inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof which received him. Straberius, the commander of the garrison, abandoned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar assembled his army and congratulated them on the success they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad achieved by their rapid movement in mid-winter, on conquering such a sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout war-ships, on taking Oricum and Apollonia without a fight, and on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapturing the enemy's supplies, as he had predicted, without Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge. \"If we can anticipate him in reaching Dyrrachium, his military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarsenal,\" he added, \"we shall be in possession of all the things they have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected by the labors of a whole summer.\" After speaking thus he led his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers directly toward Dyrrachium over a long road, not stopping day or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight. Pompey, being advised beforehand, marched toward the same place from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia with extreme haste\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso, cutting down trees along the road, in order to obstruct\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's passage, destroying bridges, and setting fire to all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies he met with, considering it of the greatest importance (as it was)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto defend his own arsenal. If either of them saw any dust, or fire, or smoke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a distance they thought it was caused by the other, and they strove like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tathletes in a race. They did not allow themselves time for food or sleep.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll was haste and eagerness mingled with the shouts of guides who carried\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttorches, causing tumult and fear as when hostile armies are ever drawing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearer and nearer to each other. Some of the soldiers from fatigue threw\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway their loads. Others hid themselves in ravines and were left behind,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchanging their fear of the enemy for a moment's rest. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the midst of such vicissitudes on either side Pompey arrived first at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDyrrachium and encamped near it. He sent a fleet and retook Oricum and kept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strictest watch on the sea. C\u00e6sar pitched his camp so that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver Alor ran between himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pompey. By crossing the stream they had occasional cavalry skirmishes\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith each other. The armies did not come to a general engagement, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Pompey was still exercising his new levies and C\u00e6sar waited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the forces left at Brundusium. The latter apprehended that if these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould sail in merchant ships in the spring they would not escape Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes, which would be patrolling the sea, as guard ships, in great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, but if they should cross in winter while the enemy were lying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinside among the islands they might perhaps be unnoticed, or might force\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir way by the strength of the wind and the size of their ships. So he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent orders to them to hasten. As they did not come he decided to cross over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly to that army, because no one else could bring them so easily. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed his intention and sent three servants to the river, a distance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwelve stades, to procure a fast-sailing vessel and a first rate pilot as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a messenger sent by C\u00e6sar. \n\t\t\t\t"},"8":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he rose from supper pretending to be fatigued and told his friends to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain at the table. He put on the clothing of a private person, stepped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a chariot, and drove away to the ship, pretending to be the one sent by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. He gave the rest of his orders through his servants and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained concealed by the darkness of the night and unrecognized. As there\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a severe wind blowing the servants told the pilot to be of good courage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand seize this opportunity to avoid the enemy who were in the neighborhood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe pilot made his way down the river by rowing. When they came toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmouth they found it broken into surf by the wind and the sea. The pilot at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe instigation of the servants put forth all his efforts, but as he could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake no progress he became fatigued and gave it up. Then C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrew off his disguise and called out to him, \" Brave the tempest with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstout heart, you carry C\u00e6sar and C\u00e6sar's fortunes.\" Both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rowers and the pilot were astounded and all took fresh courage and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgained the mouth of the river, but the wind and waves cast the ship high on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bank. As the dawn was near and they feared lest the enemy should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscover them in the daylight, C\u00e6sar, after accusing his evil\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenius for its invidiousness, allowed the ship to return, and it sailed up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river with a strong wind. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of C\u00e6sar's friends were astonished at this act of bravery;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers blamed him, saying that it was a deed becoming a soldier but not a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral. As C\u00e6sar saw that he could not conceal a second attempt\n\t\t\t\t\t\the ordered Postumius to sail to Brundusium in his place and tell Gabinius to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcross over with the army immediately, and if he did not obey, to give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame order to Antony, and if he failed then to give it to Calenus. Another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tletter was written to the whole army in case all three should hesitate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying, \"that every one who was willing to do so should follow Postumius on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshipboard and sail to any place where the wind might carry them, and not to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmind what happened to the ships, because C\u00e6sar did not want ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut men.\" Thus did C\u00e6sar put his trust in fortune rather than in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprudence. Pompey, in order to anticipate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's re\u00ebnforcements, made haste and led his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward prepared for battle. While two of his soldiers were searching in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmidstream for the best place to cross the river, one of C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen attacked and killed them both, whereupon Pompey drew back, as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered this event inauspicious. All of his friends blamed him for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmissing this capital opportunity. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Postumius arrived at Brundusium Gabinius did not obey the order, but led\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were willing to go with him by way of Illyria by forced marches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlmost all of them were destroyed by the Illyrians and C\u00e6sar was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobliged to endure the outrage on account of his preoccupation. Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembarked the remainder of the army and sailed for Apollonia with a favorable\n\t\t\t\t\t\twind. About noon the wind failed and twenty of Pompey's ships, that had put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout to search the sea, discovered and pursued them. There was great fear on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's vessels lest in this calm the warships of the enemy should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tram them with their prows and sink them. They prepared themselves for battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand began to discharge stones and darts, when suddenly the wind sprang up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than before, filled their great sails unexpectedly, and enabled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to complete their voyage without fear. The pursuers were left behind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand they suffered severely from the wind and waves in the narrow sea and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere scattered along a harborless and rocky coast. With difficulty they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured two of C\u00e6sar's ships that ran on a shoal. Antony brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe remainder to the port of Nymph\u00e6um. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now C\u00e6sar had his whole army together and so had Pompey his. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped opposite each other on hills in numerous redoubts. There were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequent collisions around each of these redoubts while they were making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlines of circumvallation and trying to cut off each other's supplies. In one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these fights in front of a redoubt C\u00e6sar's men were worsted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a centurion, of the name of Sc\u00e6va, while performing many deeds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof valor, was wounded in the eye with a dart. He advanced in front of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen beckoning with his hand as though he wished to say something. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilence was obtained he called out to one of Pompey's centurions, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikewise distinguished for bravery, \"Save one of your equals, save your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriend, send somebody to lead me by the hand, for I am wounded.\" Two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers advanced to him thinking that he was a deserter. One of these he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled before the stratagem was discovered and he cut off the shoulder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other. This he did because he despaired of saving himself and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tredoubt. His men, moved by shame at this act of self-devotion, rushed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward and saved the redoubt. Minucius, the commander of the post, also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered severely. It is said that he received 120 missiles on his shield,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas wounded six times, and, like Sc\u00e6va, lost an eye. C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonored them both with many military gifts. A certain man of Dyrrachium\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving offered to betray the town to him, C\u00e6sar went by agreement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a small force by night to the gates at the temple of Artemis. . . . The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame winter Pompey's father-in-law (Scipio) advanced with another army from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria. C\u00e6sar's general, Gaius Calvisius, had an engagement with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in Macedonia, was beaten, and lost a whole legion except 800 men. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As C\u00e6sar could obtain no supplies by sea, on account of Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnaval superiority, his army began to suffer from hunger and was compelled to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake bread from herbs. When deserters brought loaves of this kind to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey, thinking that he would be gladdened by the spectacle, he was not at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall pleased, but said, \"What kind of wild beasts are we fighting with ?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen C\u00e6sar, compelled by necessity, drew his whole army together\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to force Pompey to fight even against his will. The latter occupied\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta number of the redoubts that C\u00e6sar had vacated and remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquiet. C\u00e6sar was greatly vexed at this and ventured upon an\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremely difficult and chimerical task; that is, to carry a line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumvallation around the whole of Pompey's positions from sea to sea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthinking that even if he should fail he would acquire great renown from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldness of the enterprise. The circuit was 1200 stades. So,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat was the work that C\u00e6sar undertook. Pompey built a line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountervallation. Thus they parried each other's efforts. Nevertheless, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought one great battle in which Pompey defeated C\u00e6sar in the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrilliant manner and pursued his men in headlong flight to his camp and took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany of his standards. The eagle (the standard held in highest honor by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans) was saved with difficulty, the bearer having just time to throw it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the palisade to those within. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While this remarkable defeat was in progress C\u00e6sar brought up other\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops from another quarter, but these also fell into a panic even when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeheld Pompey still far distant. Although they were already close to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgates they would neither make a stand, nor enter in good order, nor obey the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands given to them, but all fled pell-mell without shame, without\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders, without reason. C\u00e6sar ran among them and with reproaches\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed them that Pompey was still far distant, yet under his very eye some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrew down their standards and fled, while others bent their gaze upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground in shame and did nothing; so great consternation had befallen them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of the standard bearers, with his standard reversed, dared to thrust the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of it at C\u00e6sar himself, but the attendants of the latter cut\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim down. When the soldiers entered the camp they did not station any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguards. All precautions were neglected and the fortification was left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunprotected, so that it is probable that Pompey might then have captured it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand brought the war to an end by that one engagement had not Labienus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmisled by a god, persuaded him to pursue the fugitives instead. Moreover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey himself hesitated, either because he suspected a stratagem when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw the gates unguarded or because he considered the war already decided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis battle. So he turned against those outside of the camp and made a heavy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter and took twenty-eight standards in the two engagements of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday, but he here missed his second opportunity to give the finishing stroke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the war. It is reported that C\u00e6sar said, \"The war would have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen ended to-day in the enemy's favor if they had had a commander who knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow to make use of a victory.\" \n\t\t\t\t"},"9":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey sent letters to all the kings and cities magnifying his victory, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the expected that C\u00e6sar's army would come over to him directly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconceiving that it was oppressed by hunger and cast down by defeat, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially the officers because apprehensive of punishment for their bad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconduct in the battle. But the latter, as though some god had brought them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto repentance, were ashamed of their fault, and as C\u00e6sar chided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem gently and granted them pardon, they became still more angry with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and by a surprising change demanded that they should be decimated\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the law of their country. When C\u00e6sar did not agree to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis they were still more mortified, and acknowledged that he had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshamefully treated by them. They cried out that he should at least put the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandard bearers to death because they themselves would never have run away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunless the standards had turned in flight first. C\u00e6sar would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsent to this, but he reluctantly punished a few. So great was the zeal\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcited among all by his moderation that they demanded to be led against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy immediately. They urged him vehemently, beseeching and promising to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twipe out their disgrace by a splendid victory. Of their own accord they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisited each other in military order and took an oath by companies, under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe eye of C\u00e6sar himself, that they would not leave the field of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle except as victors. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Wherefore C\u00e6sar's friends urged him to avail himself of the army's\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepentance and eagerness promptly, but he said in the hearing of the host,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would take a better opportunity to lead them against the enemy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the exhorted them to be mindful of their present zeal. He privately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmonished his friends that it was necessary first for the soldiers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecover from the very great alarm of their recent defeat, and for the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lose something of their present high confidence. He confessed also that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had made a mistake in encamping before Dyrrachium where Pompey had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabundance of supplies, whereas he ought to have drawn him to some place\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he would be subject to the same scarcity as themselves. After saying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis he marched directly to Apollonia and from there to Thessaly, advancing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby night in order to conceal his movements. The small town of Gomphi \n\t\t\t\t\t\tto which he came refused to open its gates to him, and he took it by storm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand allowed his army to plunder it. The soldiers, who had suffered much from\n\t\t\t\t\t\thunger, stuffed themselves immoderately and drank wine to excess. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGermans among them were especially ridiculous under the influence of drink.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt seems probable that Pompey might have attacked them then and gained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother victory had he not disdainfully neglected a close pursuit. After\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseven days of rapid marching C\u00e6sar encamped near Pharsalus. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that among the notable calamities of Gomphi the bodies of twenty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvenerable men of the first rank were found lying on the floor in an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapothecary's shop, not wounded, and with goblets near them, as though they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere drunk, and that one of them, like a physician, was seated in a chair\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had dealt out poison to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After C\u00e6sar had withdrawn Pompey called a council of war, at which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfranius advised that they should make use of their naval force in which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were much superior, and being masters of the sea should harass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, who was now wandering and destitute, and that Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself should conduct his infantry with all haste to Italy, which was well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposed toward him and was now free from a hostile army. Having mastered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, together with Gaul and Spain, they could attack C\u00e6sar again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom their own home, the seat of imperial power. Although this was the best\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible advice Pompey disregarded it and allowed himself to be persuaded by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who said that C\u00e6sar's army would presently desert to him on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of hunger, and that there was not much left of it anyway after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory of Dyrrachium. They said it would be disgraceful to abandon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuit of C\u00e6sar when he was in flight, and for the victor to flee\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas though vanquished. Pompey sided with these advisers partly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of regard for the opinions of the eastern nations that were looking on,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly to prevent any harm befalling Lucius Scipio, who was still in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia, but most of all because he thought that he ought to fight while\n\t\t\t\t\t\this army was in high spirits. Accordingly he advanced and pitched his camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite to C\u00e6sar's near Pharsalus, so that they were separated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom each other by a distance of thirty stades. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey's supplies came from every quarter, for the roads, harbors, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongholds had been so provided beforehand that food was brought to him at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall times from the land, and every wind blew it to him from the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, on the other hand, had only what he could find with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty and seize by hard labor. Yet even so nobody deserted him, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall, by a kind of divine fury, longed to come to close quarters with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy. They considered that they, who had been trained in arms for ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, were much superior to the new levies of Pompey in fighting, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor digging ditches and building fortifications and for laborious foraging\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were weaker by reason of their age. Tired as they were they altogether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred to perform some deed of valor rather than perish with hunger in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinaction. Pompey perceived this and he considered it dangerous to risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything on a single battle with disciplined and desperate men, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the amazing luck of C\u00e6sar. It would be easier and safer to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduce them by want as they controlled no fertile territory, and could get\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing by sea, and had no ships for rapid flight. So he decided on the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprudent calculation to protract the war and wear out the enemy by hunger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom day to day. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey was surrounded by a great number of senators, of equal rank with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, by very distinguished knights, and by many kings and princes. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these, by reason of their inexperience in war, others because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo much elated by the victory at Dyrrachium, others because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutnumbered the enemy, and others because they were quite tired of the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand preferred a quick decision rather than a sound one -- all urged him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight, pointing out to him that C\u00e6sar was always drawn up for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle and challenging him. Pompey answered along this very line of argument\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby saying that C\u00e6sar was compelled to do so by his want of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies, and that they had the more reason to remain quiet because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was pushed by necessity. Yet, harassed by the whole army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was unduly puffed up by the victories at Dyrrachium, and by men of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trank who accused him of being fond of power and of delaying purposely in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to prolong his authority over so many men of his own rank -- and for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reason called him derisively king of kings and Agamemnon, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat general also ruled over kings while war lasted -- he allowed himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe moved from his own purpose and gave in to them, being deceived now by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgod that had misled him on other occasions during the whole of this war. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad now become, contrary to his nature, sluggish and dilatory in all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he prepared for battle against his will, to his own hurt and that of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen who had persuaded him to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t That same night three of C\u00e6sar's legions started out to forage; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar himself approved Pompey's dilatory proceedings and had no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tidea that he would change, and accordingly sent them out to procure food.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen he perceived that the enemy was preparing to fight he was delighted at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pressure which he conjectured had been put upon Pompey by his army, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the recalled all of his forces at once and made preparations on his own side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe offered sacrifice at midnight and invoked Mars and his own ancestress,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVenus (for it was believed that from \u00c6neas and his son, Ilus, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescended the Julian race, with a slight change of name), and he vowed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the would build a temple in Rome as a thank-offering to her as the Bringer of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVictory if everything went well. Thereupon a flame from heaven flew through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe air from C\u00e6sar's camp to Pompey's, where it was extinguished.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey's men said that it signified a brilliant victory for them over their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, but C\u00e6sar interpreted it as meaning that he should fall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon and extinguish the fame and power of Pompey. When Pompey was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrificing the same night some of the victims escaped and could not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaught, and a swarm of bees settled on the altar, the type of weakness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tShortly before daylight a panic occurred in his army. He himself went around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand quieted it and then fell into a deep sleep. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When his friends aroused him he said that he had just dreamed that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdedicated a temple in Rome to Venus the Bringer of Victory. His friends and\n\t\t\t\t\t\this whole army when they heard of this were delighted, being in ignorance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's vow, and they went about their work in a reckless and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontemptuous way as though it were already accomplished. Many of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadorned their tents with laurel branches, the insignia of victory, and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves prepared magnificent banquets for them. Some of them began already to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontend with each other for C\u00e6sar's office of Pontifex Maximus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey, being experienced in military affairs, turned away from these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsquabbles with concealed indignation. He remained altogether silent in\n\t\t\t\t\t\thesitancy and dread, as though he were no longer commander but under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand, and as though he were doing everything under compulsion and against\n\t\t\t\t\t\this judgment; such dejection had come over this man of great deeds (who,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil this day, had been most fortunate in every undertaking), either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he had not carried his point when he had decided what was the best\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse but was about to cast the die involving the safety of so many men and\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso involving his own reputation, until now invincible; or because some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresentiment of approaching evil troubled him, presaging his complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownfall that very day from a position of such vast power. After merely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying to his friends that whichever should conquer, that day would be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of great evils to the Romans for all future time, he began to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements for the battle. In this remark some people thought his real\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions escaped him, involuntarily expressed in a moment of fright, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey inferred that if Pompey had been victorious he would not have laid down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe supreme power. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar's army (for since many writers differ I shall follow the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredible Roman authorities, who give the most careful enumeration of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian soldiers, in whom they place most confidence, but do not make much\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the allied forces or record them exactly, regarding them as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeigners and as contributing to them little real assistance) consisted of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 22,000 men and of these about 1000 were cavalry. Pompey had more than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble that number, of whom about 7000 were cavalry. Some of the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrustworthy writers say that 70,000 Italian soldiers were engaged in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle. Others give the smaller number, 60,00000. Still others, grossly\n\t\t\t\t\t\texaggerating, say 400,000. Of the whole number some say Pompey's forces were to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose of C\u00e6sar as one-and-a-half to one, others say that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo parts out of three. So much doubt is there as to the exact truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever that may be, each of them placed his chief reliance on his Italian\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops. In the way of allied forces C\u00e6sar had cavalry from both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, besides some light-armed Greeks, consisting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Dolopians, Acarnanians, and \u00c6tolians. Such were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's allies. Pompey had a great number from all the eastern\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnations, part horse, part foot. From Greece he had Lacedemonians marshalled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby their own kings, and others from Peloponnesus and B\u0153otians with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. The Athenians marched to his aid also, although proclamation had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade on both sides that no harm should be done to them by the soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince they were the priests of the Thesmophor\u00e6. Nevertheless, they wished to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare in the glory of the war because this was a contest for the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides the Greeks almost all the nations that one meets in making the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircuit of the eastern sea sent aid to Pompey: Thracians, Hellespontines,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBithynians, Phrygians, Ionians, Lydians, Pamphylians, Pisidians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPaphlagonians, Cilicians, Syrians, Ph\u0153nicians, Hebrews, and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighbors the Arabs, Cyprians, Rhodians, Cretan slingers, and other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tislanders. Kings and princes were there leading their own troops:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDe\u00efotarus, the tetrarch of Galatia in the East, and Ariarthes, king\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Cappadocia. Taxiles commanded \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THESSALY & SOUTHERN MACEDONIA \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t the Armenians from the hither side of the Euphrates. Those from the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside were led by Megabates, the lieutenant of King Artabazes. Some other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall princes took part with Pompey in the work. It was said that sixty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships from Egypt were contributed to him by the sovereigns of that country,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCleopatra and her brother, who was still a boy. But these did not take part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the battle, nor did any other naval force. They remained idle at Corcyra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey seems to have acted very foolishly in this respect in disregarding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fleet, in which he excelled so greatly that he could have deprived the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy of all the supplies brought to them from abroad, and in risking a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle on land with men who boasted that they were inured to every kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoil and who were ferocious fighters. Although he had been on his guard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst them at Dyrrachium, a certain spell seems to have come over him at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime when it would inure most to C\u00e6sar's advantage. Under this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell also Pompey's army was most nonsensically puffed up, and rendered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsubordinate to its own commander, and hurried into action without previous\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience in war. But this was the ordering of divine Providence to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the imperial power which now embraces everything. \n\t\t\t\t"},"10":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then each of the commanders assembled his soldiers and made an appeal to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Pompey spoke as follows: \"You, my fellow soldiers, are the leaders in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis task rather than the led, for while I was still desirous of wearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar out by hunger you urged on this engagement. Since,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, you are the arbiters of the battle, conduct yourselves like those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho are greatly superior in numbers. Despise the enemy as victors do the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvanquished, as young men do the old, as fresh troops do those who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\twearied with many toils. Fight like those who have the power and the means,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the consciousness of a good cause. We are contending for liberty and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. On our side are the laws and honorable fame, and this great number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof senators and knights, against one man who has seized the government by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trobbery. Go forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, as you have determined to do, with good hope, keeping in vision the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight of the enemy at Dyrrachium, and the great number of their standards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we captured in one day when we defeated them there.\" Such was Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar addressed his men as follows: \"My friends, we have already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tovercome our most formidable enemies, and are now about to encounter not\n\t\t\t\t\t\thunger and want, but men. This day will decide everything. Remember what you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised me at Dyrrachium. Remember how you swore to each other in my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresence that you would never leave the field except as conquerors. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, fellow-soldiers, are the same that we met at the Pillars of Hercules,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same that we drove out of Italy. They are the same who sought to disband\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus without honors, without a triumph, without rewards, after the toils and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstruggles of ten years, after we had finished those great wars, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinnumerable victories, and after we had added 400 nations in Spain, Gaul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Britain to our country's sway. I have not been able to prevail upon them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby offering fair terms, nor to win them by benefits. You know that I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdismissed them unharmed, hoping that we should obtain justice from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecall all these facts to your minds to-day, and if you have had any\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience of me recall also my care for you, my good faith, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerosity of my gifts to you. \n\t\t\t\t\t 74 \"Nor is it difficult for hardy and veteran soldiers to overcome new\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecruits who are without experience in war, and who, moreover, like boys,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspurn the rules of discipline and of obedience to their commander. I learn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was afraid and unwilling to come to an engagement. His star has\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready passed its zenith; he has become slow and hesitating in all his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacts, and no longer commands, but obeys the orders of others. I say these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings of his Italian forces only. As for his allies, do not think about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, pay no attention to them, do not fight with them at all. They are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyrian, Phrygian, and Lydian slaves, always ready for flight or servitude. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow very well, and you will presently see, that Pompey himself will not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassign them any place in his line of battle. Give your attention to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalians only, even though these allies come running around you like dogs\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to frighten you. When you have put the enemy to flight let us spare\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Italians as being our own kindred, but slaughter the allies in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrike terror into the others. Before all else, in order that I may know\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you are mindful of your promise to choose victory or death, throw down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls of your camp as you go out to battle and fill up the ditch, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we may have no place of refuge if we do not conquer, and so that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy may see that we have no camp and know that we are compelled to occupy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheirs.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, after he had thus spoken C\u00e6sar detailed 2000 of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\toldest men to guard the tents. The rest, as they passed out, demolished\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir fortification in the profoundest silence and filled up the ditch with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe debris. When Pompey saw this, although some of his friends thought that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was a preparation for flight, he knew it was an exhibition of daring and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroaned in spirit, that although they had with them famine, the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappropriate cure for such wild beasts, he must now meet these creatures in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand-to-hand contest. But there was no drawing back now, his affairs being\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the razor's edge. Wherefore, leaving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4000 of his Italian troops to guard his camp, Pompey drew up the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the city of Pharsalus and the river Enipeus opposite the place where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was marshalling his forces. Each of them ranged his Italians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin front, divided into three lines with a moderate space between them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaced his cavalry on the wings of each division. Archers and slingers were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmingled among all. Thus were the Italian troops disposed, on which each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommander placed his chief reliance. The allied forces were marshalled by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves rather for show than for use. There was great clamor and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfusion of tongues among Pompey's auxiliaries. Pompey stationed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonians, Peloponnesians, B\u0153otians, and Athenians near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian legions, as he approved of their good order and quiet behavior. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest, as C\u00e6sar had anticipated, he ordered to lie in wait by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribes outside of the line of battle, and when the engagement should become\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclose to surround the enemy, to pursue, to do what damage they could, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplunder C\u00e6sar's camp, which was without defences. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The centre of Pompey's formation was commanded by his father-in-law, Scipio,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe left wing by Domitius Ahenobarbus, and the right by Lentulus. Afranius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pompey guarded the camp. On C\u00e6sar's side the commanders were P.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla, Antony, and Cn. Domitius. C\u00e6sar took a convenient place in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tenth legion, as was his custom. When the enemy saw this they\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferred, to face that legion, the best of their horse, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurround it if they could, by their superiority of numbers. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar perceived this movement he placed 3000 of his bravest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot-soldiers in ambush and ordered them, when they should see the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to flank him, to rise, dart forward, and thrust their spears directly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the faces of the men because, as they were fresh and inexperienced and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill in the bloom of youth, they could not endure injury to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaces. Thus they laid their plans against each other,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand each commander passed through the ranks of his own troops, attending to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat was needful, exhorting his men to courage, and giving them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatchword, which on C\u00e6sar's side was \"Venus the Victorious,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Pompey's \"Hercules the Invincible.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When all was in readiness on both sides they waited for some time in profound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilence, hesitating, looking steadfastly at each other, each expecting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother to begin the battle. They were stricken with sorrow for the great\n\t\t\t\t\t\thost, for never before had such large Roman armies confronted the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger together. They had pity for the valor of these men (the elite of both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparties), especially because they saw Romans embattled against Romans. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe danger came nearer, the ambition that had inflamed and blinded them was\n\t\t\t\t\t\textinguished, and gave place to fear. Reason purged the mad passion for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglory, estimated the peril, and exposed the cause of the war, showing how\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo men contending with each other for supremacy had put themselves in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition where the one who should be vanquished could no longer hold even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe humblest place, and how so great a number of the nobility were incurring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same risk on their account. The leaders reflected also that they, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad lately been friends and relatives by marriage, and had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated with each other in many ways to gain rank and power, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow drawn the sword for mutual slaughter and were leading to the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpiety those serving under them, men of the same city, of the same tribe,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblood relations, and in some cases brothers against brothers. Even these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances were not wanting in this battle; because many unexpected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings must happen when thousands of the same nation come together in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclash of arms. Reflecting on these things each of them was seized with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunavailing repentance, and since this day was to decide for each whether he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be the highest or the lowest of the human race, they hesitated to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegin the fight. It is said that both of them shed tears. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were waiting and looking at each other the day was advancing. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Italian troops stood motionless in their places, but when Pompey saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat his allied forces were falling into confusion by reason of the delay he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared lest the disorder should spread from them before the beginning of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle. So he gave the signal first and C\u00e6sar re\u00ebchoed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. Straightway the trumpets, of which there were many distributed among so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat a host, aroused the soldiers with their inspiring blasts, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandard-bearers and officers put themselves in motion and exhorted their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen. The latter advanced confidently to the encounter, but with stolidity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand absolute silence, like men who had had experience in many similar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagements. And now, as they came nearer together, there was first a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdischarge of arrows and stones. Then as the cavalry were a little in advance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the infantry they charged each other. Those of Pompey prevailed and began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto flank the tenth legion. C\u00e6sar then gave the signal to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcohorts in ambush and these, starting up suddenly, advanced to meet the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcavalry, and with spears elevated aimed at the faces of the riders. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter could not endure the enemy's savagery, nor the blows on their mouths\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand eyes, but fled in disorder. Thereupon C\u00e6sar's men, who had just now been afraid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof being surrounded, fell upon the flank of Pompey's infantry which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdenuded of its cavalry supports. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Pompey learned this he ordered his infantry not to advance farther, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto break the line of formation, and not to hurl the javelin, but to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir spears to a rest and ward off the onset of the enemy. Some persons\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraise this order of Pompey as the best in a case where one is attacked in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflank, but C\u00e6sar criticises it in his letters. He says that the blows are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered with more force, and that the spirits of the men are raised, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\trunning, while those who stand still lose courage by reason of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmobility and become excellent targets for those charging against them. So,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the says, it proved in this case, for the tenth legion, with C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, surrounded Pompey's left wing, now deprived of cavalry, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassailed it with javelins in flank, where it stood immovable; until,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinally, the assailants threw it into disorder, routed it, and this was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of the victory. In the rest of the field killing and wounding of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall kinds were going on, but no cry came from the scene of carnage, no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamentation from the wounded or the dying, only sighs and groans from those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were falling honorably in their tracks. The allies, who were looking at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe battle as at a game, were astonished at the discipline of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombatants. So dumfounded were they that they did not dare attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's tents, although they were guarded only by a few old men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNor did they accomplish anything else, but stood in a kind of stupor. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As Pompey's left wing began to give way his men even still retired step by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstep and in perfect order, but the allies who had not been in the fight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfled with headlong speed, shouting, \"we are vanquished,\" dashed upon their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town tents and fortifications as though they had been the enemy's, and pulled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown and plundered whatever they could carry away in their flight. Now the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of Pompey's legions, perceiving the disaster to the left wing, retired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowly at first, in good order, and still resisting as well as they could;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut when the enemy, flushed with victory, pressed upon them they turned in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight. Then, in order that they might not rally, and that this might be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the whole war and not of one battle merely, C\u00e6sar, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatest prudence, sent heralds everywhere among the ranks to order the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictors to spare their own countrymen and to smite only the auxiliaries. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\theralds drew near to the retreating enemy and told them to stand still\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout fear. As this proclamation was passed from man to man they halted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the phrase \"stand without fear\" began to be passed as a sort of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatchword among Pompey's soldiers; for, being Italians, they were clad in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same style as C\u00e6sar's men and spoke the same language.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, the latter passed by them and fell upon the auxiliaries, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not able to resist, and made a very great slaughter among them. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Pompey saw the retreat of his men he became dazed and retired slowly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this camp, and when he reached his tent he sat down speechless, resembling Ajax, the son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTelamon, who, they say, suffered in like manner in the midst of his enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Troy, being deprived of his senses by a god. Very few of the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to the camp, for C\u00e6sar's proclamation caused them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain unharmed, and as their enemies had passed beyond them they dispersed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin groups. As the day was declining C\u00e6sar ran hither and thither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong his troops and besought them to continue their exertions till they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould capture Pompey's \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t JULIUS C\u00c6SAR AS IMPERATOR \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the Palace of the Conservators, Rome \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t camp, telling them that if they allowed the enemy to rally they would be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictors for only a single day, whereas if they should take the enemy's camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would finish the war with this one blow. He stretched out his hands to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and took the lead in person. Although they were weary in body, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twords and example of their commander lightened their spirits. Their success\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso far, and the hope of capturing the enemy's camp and the contents thereof,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcited them; for in the midst of hope and prosperity men feel fatigue\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleast. So they fell upon the camp and assaulted it with the utmost disdain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the defenders. When Pompey learned this he started up from his strange\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilence, exclaiming, \"What! in our very camp?\" Having spoken thus he changed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this clothing, mounted a horse, and fled with four friends, and did not draw\n\t\t\t\t\t\trein until he reached Larissa early the next morning. So C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\testablished himself in Pompey's camp as he had promised to do when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparing for the battle, and ate Pompey's supper, and the whole army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeasted at the enemy's expense. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The losses of Italians on each side -- for there was no report of the losses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof auxiliaries, either because of their multitude or because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespised -- were as follows: in C\u00e6sar's army. thirty centurions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 200 legionaries, or, as some authorities have it, 1200; on Pompey's side ten senators, among whom was Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomitius, the same who had been sent to succeed C\u00e6sar himself in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul, and about forty distinguished knights. Some exaggerating writers put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe loss in the remainder of his forces at 25,000, but Asinius Pollio, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas one of C\u00e6sar's officers in this battle, records the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead Pompeians found as 6000. Such was the result of the famous battle of Pharsalus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar himself carries off the palm for first and second place by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon consent, and with him the tenth legion. The third place is taken by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe centurion Crastinus, whom C\u00e6sar asked at the beginning of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle what result he anticipated, and who responded proudly, \"We shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquer, O C\u00e6sar, and you will thank me either living or dead.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe whole army testifies that he darted through the ranks like one possessed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand did many brilliant deeds. When sought for he was found among the dead,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand C\u00e6sar bestowed military honors on his body and buried it, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\terected a special tomb for him near the common burial-place of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tothers. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"11":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t From Larissa Pompey continued his flight to the sea where he embarked in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall boat, and meeting a ship by chance he sailed to Mitylene. There he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined his wife, Cornelia, and they embarked with four triremes which had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome to him from Rhodes and Tyre. He decided not to sail for Corcyra and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, where he had other large military and naval forces as yet untouched,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut intended to push on eastward to the king of the Parthians, expecting to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceive every assistance from him. He concealed his intention until he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrived at Cilicia, where he revealed it hesitatingly to his friends; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey advised him to beware of the Parthian, against whom Crassus had lately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tled an expedition, and who was puffed up by his victory over the latter, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially not to put in the power of these barbarians the beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornelia, who had formerly been the wife of Crassus. Then he made a second proposal respecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt and Juba. The latter they despised as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot sufficiently distinguished, but they all agreed about going to Egypt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was near and was a great kingdom, still prosperous and abounding in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships, provisions, and money. Its sovereigns, although children, were allied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pompey by their father's friendship. For these reasons he sailed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cleopatra, who had previously reigned with her brother, had been lately\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpelled from Egypt and was collecting an army in Syria. Ptolemy, her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother, was at Mount Casius in Egypt, lying in wait for her invasion, and, as Providence would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave it, the wind carried Pompey thither. Seeing a large army on the shore\n\t\t\t\t\t\the stopped his ship, judging that the king was there, which was the fact. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\the sent messengers to tell of his arrival and to speak of his father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendship. The king was then about thirteen years of age and was under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttutelage of Achillas, who commanded his army, and the eunuch Pothinus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad charge of his treasury. These took counsel together concerning Pompey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was present also Theodotus, a rhetorician of Samos, the boy's tutor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho offered the infamous advice that they should lay a trap for Pompey and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkill him in order to curry favor with C\u00e6sar. His opinion prevailed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo they sent a miserable skiff to bring him, pretending that the sea was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshallow and not adapted to large ships. Some of the king's attendants came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the skiff, among them a Roman, named Sempronius, who was then serving in the king's army and had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformerly served under Pompey himself. He gave his hand to Pompey in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tking's name and directed him to take passage in the boat to the young man as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a friend. At the same time the whole army was marshalled along the shore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas if to do honor to Pompey, and the king was plainly seen in the midst of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem wearing a purple robe. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompey's suspicions were aroused by all that he observed -- the marshalling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the army, the meanness of the skiff, and the fact that the king himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not come to meet him nor send any of his high dignitaries. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the entered the skiff, repeating to himself these lines of Sophocles,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Whoever resorts to a tyrant becomes his slave, even if he were free when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent.\" While rowing to the shore all were silent, and this made him still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore suspicious. Finally, either recognizing Sempronius as a Roman soldier\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had served under him or guessing that he was such because he alone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained standing (for, according to military discipline, a soldier does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsit in the presence of his commander), he turned to him and said, \"Do I not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow you, comrade? \" The other nodded and, as Pompey turned away, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately gave him the first stab and the others followed his example.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey's wife and friends who saw this at a distance cried out and, lifting\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir hands to heaven, invoked the gods, the avengers of violated faith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen they sailed away in all haste as from an enemy's country. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The servants of Pothinus cut off Pompey's head and kept it for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, in expectation of a large reward, but he visited condign\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment on them for their nefarious deed. The remainder of the body was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburied by somebody on the shore, and a small monument was erected over it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton which somebody else wrote this inscription: -- \n\t\t\t\t\t \"What a pitiful tomb is here for one who had temples in abundance.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t In the course of time the monument was wholly covered with sand, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbronze images that had been erected to Pompey by his partisans at a later\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod near Mount Casius had been degraded and removed to the secret recess\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the temple, but in my time they were sought for and found by the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\temperor Hadrian, while making a journey thither, who cleared away the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trubbish from the monument and made it again conspicuous, and placed Pompey's\n\t\t\t\t\t\timages in their proper places. Such was the end of Pompey, who had carried\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the greatest wars and had made the greatest additions to the empire of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Romans, and had acquired by that means the title of Great. He had never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen defeated before, but had remained unvanquished and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortunate from his youth till now. From his twenty-third to his fifty-eighth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear he had not ceased to exercise royal power, but on account of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjealousy of C\u00e6sar he had seemed to rule in the interest of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Lucius Scipio, Pompey's father-in-law, and the other notables who had escaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the battle of Pharsalus, more prudent than Pompey, proceeded to Corcyra\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand joined Cato, who had been left there with another army and 300 triremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe leaders apportioned the fleet among themselves, and Cassius sailed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPharnaces in Pontus to induce him to take up arms against C\u00e6sar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio and Cato embarked for Africa, relying on Varus and his army and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tally, Juba, king of Numidia. The elder son of Pompey, together with Labienus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Scapula, each with his own part of the army, hastened to Spain and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving detached it from C\u00e6sar, collected a new army of Spaniards,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeltiberians, and slaves, and made formidable preparations for war. So great\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the forces still remaining which Pompey had prepared, and which Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself over-looked and ran away from in his insanity. Cato had been chosen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommander of the forces in Africa, but he declined the appointment since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were consulars present who outranked him, he having held only the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6torship in Rome. So Lucius Scipio was made the commander and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected and drilled a large army there. Thus two armies of considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude were brought together against C\u00e6sar, one in Africa and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other in Spain. \n\t\t\t\t"},"12":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar remained two days at Pharsalus after the victory, offering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice and giving his army a respite from fighting. Then he set free his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThessalian allies and granted pardon to the suppliant Athenians, and said to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, \" How often will the glory of your ancestors save you from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tself-destruction?\" On the third day he marched eastward, having learned that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey had fled thither, and for want of triremes he essayed to cross the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHellespont in skiffs. Here Cassius came upon him in mid-stream, with a part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his fleet, as he was hastening to Pharnaces. Although he might have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmastered these small boats with his numerous triremes he was panic-stricken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby C\u00e6sar's astounding success, which was then heralded with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsternation everywhere, and he thought that C\u00e6sar had sailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposely against him. So he extended his hands in entreaty from his trireme\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward the skiff, begged pardon, and surrendered his fleet. So great was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower of C\u00e6sar's prestige. I can see no other reason myself, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan I think of any other instance where fortune was more propitious in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying emergency than when Cassius, a most valiant man, with seventy\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes, fell in with C\u00e6sar when he was unprepared, but did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tventure to come to blows with him. And yet he who thus disgracefully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrendered to C\u00e6sar, through fear alone, when the latter was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrossing the straits, afterward murdered him in Rome when he was at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\theight of his power; by which fact it is evident that the panic which then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseized Cassius was due to the fortune by which C\u00e6sar was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuplifted. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Being thus unexpectedly saved, C\u00e6sar passed the Hellespont and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgranted pardon to the Ionians, the \u00c6olians, and the other peoples\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho inhabit the great peninsula called by the common name of Lower Asia, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho sent ambassadors to him to ask it. Learning that Pompey had gone to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt he sailed for Rhodes. He did not wait there for his army, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming forward by detachments, but embarked with those whom he had on board\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe triremes of Cassius and the Rhodians. Letting nobody know whither he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintended to go he set sail toward evening, telling the other pilots to steer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the torch of his own ship by night and by his signal in the daytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter they had proceeded a long way from the land he ordered his pilot to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteer for Alexandria. After a three days' sail he arrived there. He was\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived by the king's guardians, the king himself being still at Mount\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCasius. At first, on account of the smallness of his forces, he pretended to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake his ease, receiving visitors in a friendly way, traversing the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmiring its beauty, and listening to the lectures of the philosophers while\n\t\t\t\t\t\the stood among the crowd. Thus he gained the good-will and esteem of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexandrians as one who had no designs against them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When his soldiers arrived by sea he punished Pothinus and Achillas with death\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor their crime against Pompey. (Theodotus escaped and was afterward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrucified by Cassius, who found him wandering in Asia. ) The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexandrians thereupon rose in tumult, and the king's army marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and various battles took place around the palace and on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighboring shores. In one of these C\u00e6sar escaped by leaping into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea and swimming a long distance in deep water. The Alexandrians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured his cloak and hung it up as a trophy. He fought the last battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the king on the banks of the Nile, in which he won a decisive victory. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumed nine months in this strife, at the end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he established Cleopatra on the throne of Egypt in place of her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother. He ascended the Nile with 400 ships, exploring the country in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany with Cleopatra and enjoying himself with her in other ways. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetails of these events are related more particularly in my Egyptian\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistory. C\u00e6sar could not bear to look at the head of Pompey when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was brought to him, but ordered that it be buried, and set apart for it a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall plot of ground near the city which was dedicated to Nemesis, but in my\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, while the Roman emperor Trajan was exterminating the Jewish race in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt, it was devastated by them in the exigencies of the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After C\u00e6sar had performed these exploits in Alexandria he hastened\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby way of Syria against Pharnaces. The latter had Already accomplished many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his aims, had seized some of the Roman countries, had fought a battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith C\u00e6sar's lieutenant, Domitius, and won a very brilliant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory over him. Being much elated by this affair he had subjugated the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity of Amisus in Pontus, which adhered to the Roman interest, sold their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants into slavery, and made all their boys eunuchs. On the approach\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof C\u00e6sar he became alarmed and repented of his deeds, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was within 200 stades he sent ambassadors to him to treat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor peace. They bore a golden crown and foolishly offered him the daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Pharnaces in marriage. When C\u00e6sar learned what they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing he moved forward with his army, walking in advance and chatting\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the ambassadors until he arrived at the camp of Pharnaces, when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely said, \"Why should I not take instant vengeance on this parricide?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen he sprang upon his horse and at the first shout put Pharnaces to flight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand killed a large number of the enemy, although he had with him only about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1000 of his own cavalry who had accompanied him in the advance. Here it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that he exclaimed, \"O fortunate Pompey, who wast considered and named\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Great for warring against such men as these in the time of Mithridates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe father of this man.\" Of this battle he wrote to Rome the words, \"I came,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI saw, I conquered.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After this, Pharnaces was glad to escape to the kingdom which Pompey had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned to him on the Bosporus. As C\u00e6sar had no time to waste on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall matters while such great wars were still unfinished elsewhere, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to the province of Asia and while passing through it transacted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic business in the cities, which were oppressed by the farmers of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevenue, as I have shown in my Asiatic history. Learning that a sedition had broken out in Rome and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, his master of horse, had occupied the forum with soldiers, he laid\n\t\t\t\t\t\taside everything else and hastened to the city. When he arrived there the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsedition had been quieted, but another one sprang up against himself in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy because the promises made to them after the battle of Pharsalus had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen kept, and because they had been held in service beyond the term fixed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby law. They demanded that they should be dismissed to their homes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had made them certain indefinite promises at Pharsalus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers equally indefinite after the war in Africa should be finished. Now he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent them a promise of 1000 drachmas more to each man. They answered him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they did not want any more promises but all cash down. Sallustius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrispus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been sent to them on this business, had a narrow escape. He would have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen killed if he had not fled. When C\u00e6sar learned of this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed the legion, with which Antony had been guarding the city, around\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own house and the city gates, as he apprehended attempts at plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen, notwithstanding all his friends were alarmed and cautioned him against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fury of the soldiers, he went boldly among them while they were still\n\t\t\t\t\t\triotous in the Campus Martius, without sending word beforehand, and showed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself on the platform. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers ran together tumultuously without arms, and, as was their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustom, saluted their commander who had suddenly appeared among them. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\the bade them tell what they wanted they were so surprised that they did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tventure to speak openly of the donative in his presence, but they adopted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe more moderate course of demanding their discharge from the service,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thoping that, since he needed soldiers for the unfinished wars, he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeak about the donative himself. But, contrary to the expectation of all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the replied without hesitation, \" I discharge you.\" Then, to their still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater astonishment, and while the silence was most profound, he added,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"And I will give you all that I have promised when I have my triumph with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers.\" At this expression, as unexpected as it was kind to them, shame\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately took possession of all, and reflection, together with jealousy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the thought of their abandoning their commander in the midst of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat wars and of others joining in the triumph instead of themselves, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their losing the gains of the war in Africa, which were expected to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat, and becoming enemies of C\u00e6sar himself as well as of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite party. Moved by these fears they remained still more silent and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembarrassed, hoping that C\u00e6sar would yield and change his mind on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of his immediate necessity. But he remained silent also, until his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends urged him to say something more to them and not leave his old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomrades of so many campaigns with a short and austere word. Then he began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto speak, addressing them first as \"citizens,\" not \"fellow-soliders,\" which\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplied that they were already discharged from the army and were private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividuals. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t They could endure it no longer, but cried out that they repented of what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad done, and besought him to keep them in his service. But C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned away and was leaving the platform when they shouted with greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\teagerness and urged him to stay and punish them for their misdeeds. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelayed a while longer, not going away and not turning back, but pretending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be undecided. At length he came back and said that he would not punish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany of them, but that he was grieved that even the tenth legion, to which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad always given the first place of honor, should join in such a riot. \"And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis legion alone,\" he continued, \"I will discharge from the service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, when I return from Africa I will give them all that I have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised. And when the wars are ended I will give lands to all, not as Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid by taking it from the present holders and colonizing the takers among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe losers, and making them everlasting enemies to each other, but I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive the public land, and my own, and will purchase what may be needful.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was clapping of hands and joyful acclaim on all sides, but the tenth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegion was plunged in grief because to them alone C\u00e6sar appeared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinexorable. They begged him to choose a portion of their number by lot and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput them to death. But C\u00e6sar, seeing that there was no need of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulating them any further when they had repented so bitterly, became\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciled to all, and departed straightway for the war in Africa. \n\t\t\t\t"},"13":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t He crossed from Rhegium to Messana and went to Lilyb\u00e6um. Here, learning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Cato was guarding the enemy's magazines with a fleet and a part of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland forces at Utica, and that he had with him 300 men who had for a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime constituted their council of war and were called the Senate, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe commander, L. Scipio, and the flower of the army were at Adrumetum, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed against \n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter. He arrived at a time when Scipio had gone away to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet Juba, and he drew up his forces for battle near Scipio's very camp in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to come to an engagement with the enemy at a time when their commander\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas absent. Labienus and Petreius, Scipio's lieutenants, attacked him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeated him badly, and pursued him in a haughty and disdainful manner until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabienus' horse was wounded in the belly and threw him, and his attendants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried him off. Petreius, thinking that he had made a thorough test of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy and that he could conquer whenever he liked, drew off his forces,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying to those around him, \"Let us not deprive our general, Scipio, of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory.\" In one part of the day's work did C\u00e6sar's luck show\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself, in that the victorious enemy seems to have abandoned the field at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very moment of success. It is said that in the flight C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdashed up to his whole line and turned it around and seizing one of those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried the principal standards (the eagles) dragged him to the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, Petreius retired and C\u00e6sar was glad to do the same. Such\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the result of C\u00e6sar's first battle in Africa. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Not long afterward it was reported that Scipio himself was advancing with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teight legions of foot, 20,000 horse (of which most were Africans), and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge number of light-armed troops, and thirty elephants; together with King\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuba, who had some 30,000 foot-soldiers in addition, raised for this war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 20,000 Numidian cavalry, besides a large number of spearmen and sixty\n\t\t\t\t\t\telephants. C\u00e6sar's army began to be alarmed and a tumult broke out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong them on account of the disaster they had already experienced and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe reputation of the forces advancing against them, and especially of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumbers and bravery of the Numidian cavalry. War with elephants, to which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were unaccustomed, also frightened them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut Bocchus, another Mauritanian prince, seized Cirta, which was the capital\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Juba's kingdom. When this news reached Juba he started for home at once\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his army, leaving thirty of his elephants only with Scipio. Thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's men plucked up courage to such a degree that the fifth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegion begged to be pitted against the elephants, and it overcame them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaliantly. From that day to the present this legion has borne the figure of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan elephant on its standards. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The battle was long, severe, and doubtful in all parts of the field until\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward evening, when victory declared itself on the side of C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho went straight on and captured Scipio's camp and did not desist, even in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe night, from reaping the fruits of his victory until he had made a clean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsweep. The enemy scattered in small bodies\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever they could. Scipio himself with Afranius, abandoning everything,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfled by sea with twelve open ships. And thus was this army also, composed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearly 80,000 men who had been under long training and were inspired with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thope and courage by the previous battle, in the second engagement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely annihilated. And now C\u00e6sar's fame began to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcelebrated as of a man of invincible fortune, and those who were vanquished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby him attributed nothing to his merit, but ascribed everything, including\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own blunders, to C\u00e6sar's luck. And it seems that the result\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this war also was due to the bad generalship of the commanders who, as in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThessaly, neglected their opportunity to wear out C\u00e6sar by delay\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil his supplies were exhausted, in this foreign land, and in like manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfailed to reap the fruits of their first victory by pushing it sharply to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As these facts became known at Utica some three days later, and as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was marching right against that place, a general flight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan. Cato did not detain anybody. He gave ships to all the nobility who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked for them, but himself adhered firmly to his post. When the inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Utica promised to intercede for him before doing so for themselves, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered with a smile that he did not need any intercessors with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, and that C\u00e6sar knew it very well. Then he placed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this seal on all the public property and gave the accounts of each kind to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe magistrates of Utica. Toward evening he bathed and dined. He ate in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsitting posture, as had been his custom since Pompey's death. He changed his habits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin no respect. He partook of the dinner, neither more nor less than usual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe conversed with the others present concerning those who had sailed away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand inquired whether the wind was favorable and whether they would make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient distance before C\u00e6sar should arrive the next morning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNor did he change any of his habits when he retired to rest, except that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembraced his son rather more affectionately than usual. As he did not find\n\t\t\t\t\t\this sword in its accustomed place by his couch, he exclaimed that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen betrayed by his servants to the enemy. \"What weapon shall I use if I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked in the night ?\" he said. When they besought him to do no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolence to himself but to go to sleep without his sword, he replied still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore plausibly, \"Could I not strangle myself with my clothing if I wished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto, or knock my brains out against the wall, or throw myself headlong to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground, or destroy myself by holding my breath?\" Much more he said to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame purport until he persuaded them to bring back his sword. When it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen put in its place he called for Plato's treatise on the soul and began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto read. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When he had read the book through and when he thought that those who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed at the doors were asleep, he stabbed himself under the breast. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintestines protruded and the attendants heard a groan and rushed in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhysicians replaced his bowels, which were still uninjured, in his body, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter sewing up the wound put a bandage around it. When Cato came to himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\the dissembled again. Although he blamed himself for the insufficiency of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twound, he expressed thanks to those who had saved him and said that he only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded sleep. The attendants then retired, taking the sword with them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosed the door, thinking that he had become quiet. When Cato thought that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were asleep, he tore off the bandage with his hands without making any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoise, opened the suture of the wound, enlarged it with his nails like a\n\t\t\t\t\t\twild beast, plunged his fingers into his stomach, and tore out his entrails\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil he died, being then about fifty years of age. He was considered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost steadfast of all men in upholding any opinion that he had once espoused\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in adhering to justice, rectitude, and morality, not as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustom merely, but rather from high-souled considerations. He had married\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcia, the daughter of Philippus, when she was a virgin. He was extremely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfond of her and had had children by her. Nevertheless, he gave her to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHortensius, one of his friends, -- who desired to have children but was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarried to a barren wife, -- until she bore a child to him also, when Cato\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook her back to his own house as though he had merely loaned her. Such a man was Cato. The Uticans gave him a magnificent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuneral. C\u00e6sar said that Cato had envied him the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity for a deed of honor, but when Cicero pronounced an encomium\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton him which he styled the Cato, C\u00e6sar wrote an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer to it which he called the Anti-Cato. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Juba and Petreius, in view of the circumstances, perceiving no chance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight or safety, slew each other with swords at a banquet. C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade Juba's kingdom tributary to the Romans and appointed Sallustius Crispus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits governor. He pardoned the Uticans and the son of Cato. He captured the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Pompey together with her two children in Utica and sent them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafe to young Pompey. Of the 300 he put to death all that he found. Lucius Scipio, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral-in-chief, was overtaken by a storm, and met a hostile fleet and bore\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself bravely until he was overpowered, when he stabbed himself and leaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the sea. This was the end of C\u00e6sar's war in Africa. \n\t\t\t\t"},"14":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When C\u00e6sar returned to Rome he had four triumphs together: one for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this Gallic wars, in which he had added many great nations to the Roman sway\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand subdued others that had revolted; one for the Pontic war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPharnaces; one for the war in Africa against the African allies of L.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScipio, in which the historian Juba (the son of King Juba), then an infant,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas led a captive. Between the Gallic and the Pontic triumphs he introduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta kind of Egyptian triumph, in which he led some captives\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken in the naval engagement on the Nile. Although he took care not to inscribe any Roman names\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his triumph (as it would have been unseemly in his eyes and base and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinauspicious in those of the Roman people to triumph over fellow-citizens),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet all these misfortunes were represented in the processions and the men\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso by various images and pictures, all except Pompey, the only one whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not venture to exhibit, since the latter was still greatly regretted by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall. The people, although restrained by fear, groaned over their domestic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tills, especially when they saw the picture of Lucius Scipio, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral-in-chief, wounded in the breast by his own hand, casting himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the sea, and Petreius committing self-destruction at the banquet, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCato torn open by himself like a wild beast. They applauded the death of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAchillas and Pothinus, and laughed at the flight of Pharnaces. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said that money to the amount of 60,500 talents [of silver] was borne\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the procession and 2822 crowns of gold weighing 20,414 pounds, from which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twealth C\u00e6sar made apportionments immediately after the triumph,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaying the army all that he had promised and more. Each soldier received\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5000 Attic drachmas, each centurion double, and each tribune of infantry and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6fect of cavalry fourfold that sum. To each plebeian citizen\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso was given an Attic mina. He gave also various spectacles with horses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand music, a combat of foot-soldiers, 1000 on each side, and a cavalry fight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 200 on each side. There was also another combat of horse and foot\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether. There was a combat of elephants, twenty against twenty, and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnaval engagement of 4000 oarsmen, where 1000 fighting men contended on each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside. He erected a temple to Venus, his ancestress, as he had vowed to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he was about to begin the battle of Pharsalus, and he laid out ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the temple which he intended to be a forum for the Roman people, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor buying and selling, but a meeting-place for the transaction of public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness, like the public squares of the Persians, where the people assemble\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto seek justice or to learn the laws. He placed a beautiful image of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCleopatra by the side of the goddess, which stands there to this day. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaused an enumeration of the people to be made, and it is said that it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound to be only one-half of the number existing before this war. To such a degree had the rivalry of these two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen reduced the city. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar, now in his fourth consulship, marched against young Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Spain. This was all that was left of the civil war, but it was not to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespised, for such of the nobility as had escaped from Africa had assembled\n\t\t\t\t\t\there. The army was composed of soldiers from Pharsalus and Africa itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had come hither with their leaders, and of Spaniards and Celtiberians, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong and warlike race. There was a great number of emancipated slaves also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Pompeius' camp. All had been under discipline four years and were ready\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fight with desperation. Pompeius was misled by this fact and did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostpone the battle, but engaged C\u00e6sar straightway on his arrival,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the older ones, who had learned by experience at Pharsalus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, advised him to wear C\u00e6sar out by delay and reduce him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant, as he was in a hostile country. C\u00e6sar made the journey from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome in twenty-seven days, coming with a heavily-laden army by a very long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t route. Fear fell upon his soldiers as never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, in consequence of the reports received of the numbers, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscipline, and the desperate valor of the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For this reason C\u00e6sar himself also was ready to move slowly until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius approached him at a certain place where he was reconnoitering and\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccused him of cowardice. C\u00e6sar could not endure this reproach. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrew up his forces for battle near Corduba and then, too, gave Venus for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this watchword. Pompeius, on the other hand, gave Piety for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this. When battle was joined fear seized upon C\u00e6sar's army and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thesitation was joined to fear. C\u00e6sar, lifting his hands toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\theaven, implored all the gods that his many glorious deeds be not stained by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis single disaster. He ran up and encourged his soldiers. He took his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelmet off his head and shamed them to their faces and exhorted them. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey abated nothing of their fear he seized a shield from a soldier and said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the officers around him, \"This shall be the end of my life and of your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary service.\" Then he sprang forward in advance of his line of battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward the enemy so far that he was only ten feet distant from them. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 missiles were aimed at him, some of which he dodged while others were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaught on his shield. Then each of the tribunes ran toward him and took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition by his side, and the whole army rushed forward and fought the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire day, advancing and retreating by turns until, toward evening,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar with difficulty won the victory. It was reported that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that he had often fought for victory, but that this time he had fought\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven for existence. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After a great slaughter the Pompeians fled to Corduba, and C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to prevent the fugitives from preparing for another battle, ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta siege of that place. The soldiers, wearied with toil, piled the bodies and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarms of the slain together, fastened them to the earth with spears, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped behind this kind of a wall. On the following day the city was\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken. Scapula, one of the Pompeian leaders, erected a funeral pile on which\n\t\t\t\t\t\the consumed himself. The heads of Varus, Labienus, and other distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen were brought to C\u00e6sar. Pompeius himself fled from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscene of his defeat with 150 horsemen toward Carteia, where he had a fleet,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand entered the dockyard secretly as a private individual borne in a litter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen he saw that the men here despaired of their safety he feared lest he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be delivered up, and took to flight again. While going on board a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall boat his foot was caught by a rope, and a man who attempted to cut the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trope with his sword cut the sole of his foot instead. So he sailed to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain place for medical treatment. Being pursued thither he fled by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trough and thorny road that aggravated his wound, until fagged out he took a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseat under a tree. Here his pursuers came upon him and he was cut down while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefending himself bravely. His head was brought to C\u00e6sar who gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders for its burial. Thus this war also, contrary to expectation, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought to an end in one battle. A younger brother of this Pompeius, also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnamed Pompeius but called by his first name, Sextus, collected those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescaped from this fight; but as yet he kept moving about in concealment and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlived by robbery. \n\t\t\t\t"},"15":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having ended the civil wars C\u00e6sar hastened to Rome, honored and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared as no one had ever been before. All kinds of honors were devised for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this gratification without stint, even such as were superhuman -- sacrifices,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgames, statues in all the temples and public places, by every tribe, by all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe provinces, and by the kings in alliance with Rome. His likeness was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpainted in various forms, in some cases crowned with oak as the savior of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this country, by which crown the citizens were accustomed formerly to reward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose to whom they owed their safety. He was proclaimed the Father of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCountry and chosen dictator for life and consul for ten years, and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson was declared sacred and inviolable. It was decreed that he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransact business on a throne of ivory and gold; that he should perform his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacerdotal functions always in triumphal costume; that each year the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould celebrate the days on which he had won his victories; that every five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears the priests and Vestal virgins should offer up public prayers for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety; and that the magistrates immediately upon their inauguration should\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake an oath not to oppose any of C\u00e6sar's decrees. In honor of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t gens the name of the month Quintilis was changed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly. Many temples were decreed to him as to a god, and one was dedicated in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon to him and the goddess Clemency, who were represented as clasping\n\t\t\t\t\t\thands. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus while they feared his power they besought his clemency. There were some\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho proposed to give him the title of king, but when he learned of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose he forbade it with threats, saying that it was an inauspicious name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby reason of the curse of their ancestors. He dismissed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6torian cohorts that had served as his bodyguard during the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twars, and showed himself with the ordinary public attendance only. To him in this state and while he was transacting business\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin front of the rostra, the Senate, preceded by the consuls, each one in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\trobes of office, brought the decree awarding him the honors aforesaid. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\textended his hand to them, but did not rise when they approached nor while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey remained there, which afforded his slanderers a pretext for accusing\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim of wishing to be greeted as a king. He accepted all the honors conferred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon him except the ten-year consulship. As consuls for the ensuing year he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignated himself and Antony, his master of horse, and he appointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, who was then governor of Spain, but was administering it by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends, master of horse in place of Antony. C\u00e6sar also recalled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exiles, except those who were banished for some very grave offence. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpardoned his enemies and forthwith advanced many of those who had fought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him to the yearly magistracies, or to the command of provinces and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies. Therefore the wearied people especially hoped that he would restore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe republic to them as Sulla did after he had grasped the same power. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this they were disappointed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Some person among those who wished to spread the report of his desire to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tking placed a crown of laurel on his statue, bound with a white fillet. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunes, Marullus and C\u00e6setius, sought out this person and put\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in prison, pretending to gratify C\u00e6sar in this way, as he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatened any who should talk about making him king. C\u00e6sar was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell satisfied with their action. Some others who met him at the city gates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas he was returning from some place greeted him as king, and when the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroaned, he said with happy readiness to those who had thus saluted him, \"I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tam no king, I am C\u00e6sar,\" as though they had mistaken his name. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattendants of Marullus found out which man began the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouting and ordered the officers to bring him to trial before his tribunal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was at last vexed and accused the faction of Marullus before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate of conspiring to make him odious by artfully accusing him of\n\t\t\t\t\t\taiming at royalty. He added that they were deserving of death, but that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be sufficient if they were deprived of their office and expelled from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate. Thus he confirmed the suspicion that he desired the title, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was privy to the attempts to confer it upon him, and that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyranny was already complete; for the cause of their punishment was their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tzeal against the title of king, and, moreover, the office of tribune was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacred and inviolable according to law and the ancient oath. By not waiting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the expiration of their office he sharpened the public indignation. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When C\u00e6sar perceived this he repented, and, reflecting that this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the first severe and arbitrary act that he had done without military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority and in time of peace, it is said that he ordered his friends to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotect him, since he had given his enemies the handle they were seeking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him. But when they asked him if he would bring together again his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpanish cohorts as a body-guard, he said, \"There is nothing more unlucky\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan perpetual watching; that is the part of one who is always afraid.\" Nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the attempts to claim royal honors for him brought to an end even thus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor, while he was in the forum looking at the games of the Lupercal, seated\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton his golden chair before the rostra, Antony, his colleague in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship, who was running naked and anointed, as was the priests' custom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat that festival, sprang upon the rostra and put a diadem on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this head. At this sight some few clapped their hands, but the greater number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroaned, and C\u00e6sar threw off the diadem. Antony again put it on\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim and again C\u00e6sar threw it off. While they were thus contending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people remained silent, being in suspense to see how it would end. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw that C\u00e6sar prevailed they shouted for joy, and at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame time applauded him because he did not accept it. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t And now C\u00e6sar, either renouncing his hope, or tired out, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twishing to avoid the plot and accusation, or giving up the city to certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his enemies, or to cure his bodily ailment of epilepsy and convulsions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich came upon him suddenly and especially when he was inactive, conceived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe idea of a long campaign against the Get\u00e6 and the Parthians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Get\u00e6, a hardy, warlike, and neigh-boring nation, were to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked first. The Parthians were to be punished for their perfidy toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrassus. He sent across the Adriatic in advance sixteen legions of foot and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10,000 horse. And now another rumor gained currency that the Sibylline books\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad predicted that the Parthians would never submit to the Romans until the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter should be commanded by a king. For this reason some people ventured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto say that C\u00e6sar ought to be called dictator and emperor of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, as he was in fact, or whatever other name they might prefer to that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof king, and that he ought to be distinctly named king of the nations that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere subject to the Romans. C\u00e6sar declined this also, and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twholly engaged in hastening his departure from the city in which he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to such envy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Four days before his intended departure he was slain by his enemies in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenate-house, either from jealousy of his fortune and power, now grown to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenormous proportions, or, as they themselves alleged, from a desire to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestore the republic of their fathers; for they well knew that if he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquer those nations he would be a king without a doubt. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut I think that they took, as a pretext for their own design, this plan for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan additional title, which really made no difference to them except in name,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor in fact a dictator is exactly the same as a king. Chief among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspirators were two men, Marcus Brutus, surnamed C\u00e6pio (son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Brutus who was put to death during the Sullan revolution), who had sided\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith C\u00e6sar after the disaster of Pharsalus, and Gaius Cassius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone who had surrendered his triremes to C\u00e6sar in the Hellespont,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth having been of Pompey's party. Among the conspirators also was Decimus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus Albinus, one of C\u00e6sar's dearest friends. All of them had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen held in honor and trust by C\u00e6sar at all times. He had\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployed them in the largest affairs. When he went to the war in Africa he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave them the command of armies, putting Decimus Brutus in charge of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTransalpine, and Marcus Brutus of Cisalpine, Gaul. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus and Cassius, who had been designated as pr\u00e6tors at the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, had a controversy with each other as to which of them should be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity pr\u00e6tor, this being the place of highest honor, either because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were really ambitious of the distinction or as a pretence so that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight not seem to have a common understanding with each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, who was chosen umpire between them, is reported to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid to his friends that justice seemed to be on the side of Cassius, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he must nevertheless favor Brutus. He exhibited the same affection and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreference for this man in all things. It was even thought that Brutus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\this son, as C\u00e6sar was the lover of his mother, Servilia (Cato's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsister) at the time of his birth, for which reason,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he won the victory at Pharsalus, it is said that he gave an immediate\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to his officers to save Brutus by all means. Whether Brutus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tungrateful, or ignorant of his mother's fault, or disbelieved it, or was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tashamed of it; whether he was such an ardent lover of liberty that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred his country to everything, or whether it was because he was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescendant of that Brutus of the olden time who expelled the kings, he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\taroused and shamed to this deed principally by people who secretly affixed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the statues of the elder Brutus and also to the tribunal of Brutus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself such writings as these, \"Brutus, are you corrupted by bribes?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Brutus, are you dead?\" or \"would that you were still alive!\" or, \"your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposterity is unworthy of you,\" or, \"you are not the descendant of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus.\" These and many like incentives fired the young man to a deed like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of his own ancestor. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While the talk about the kingship was going on, and just before there was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe a meeting of the Senate, Cassius met Brutus, and, seizing him by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, said, \"What shall we do in the senate-house if C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflatterers propose a decree making him king?\" Brutus replied that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be there. Then Cassius asked him further, \"What if we are summoned there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas pr\u00e6tors, what shall we do then, my good Brutus? \" \"I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefend my country to the death,\" he replied. Cassius embraced him, saying, \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhich of the nobility will you allow to share your thought? Do you think\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat artisans and shopkeepers have written those clandestine messages on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour tribunal, or rather the noblest Romans, those who ask from the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tors games, horse-races, and combats of wild beasts, but from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou liberty, as a boon worthy of your ancestry?\" Thus did they disclose to\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other what they had been privately thinking about for a long time. Each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them tested those of their own friends, and of C\u00e6sar's also,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom they considered the most courageous of either faction. Of their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends they inveigled two brothers, C\u00e6silius and Bucolianus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesides these Rubrius Ruga, Quintus Ligarius, Marcus Spurius, Servilius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCasca, Servius Galba, Sextius Naso, and Pontius Aquila. These were of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town faction. Of C\u00e6sar's friends they secured Decimus Brutus, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have already mentioned, also Gaius Casca, Trebonius, Tillius Cimber, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMinucius Basillus. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When they thought that they had a sufficient number, and that it would not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\twise to divulge the plot to any more, they pledged each other without oaths\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor sacrifices, yet no one changed his mind or betrayed the secret. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsought a time and place. Time was pressing because C\u00e6sar was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepart on his campaign four days hence and would thereupon have a body-guard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof soldiers. They chose the Senate as the place, believing that, even though\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe senators did not know of it beforehand, they would join heartily when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw the deed. It was said that this happened in the case of Romulus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he changed from a king to a tyrant. They thought that this deed, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one of old, taking place in open Senate, would seem to be performed not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby private plotters, but in behalf of the country, and that, being in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic interest, there would be no danger from C\u00e6sar's army. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same time they thought the honor would be theirs because the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not be ignorant that they took the lead. For these reasons they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunanimously chose the Senate as the place, but they were not agreed as to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mode. Some thought that Antony ought to be killed also because he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul with C\u00e6sar, and was his most powerful friend, and the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof most repute with the army; but Brutus said that they would win the glory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tyrannicide from the death of C\u00e6sar alone, because that would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe the killing of a king. If they should kill his friends also, the deed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be imputed to private enmity and to the Pompeian faction. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The day before the meeting of the Senate C\u00e6sar went to sup with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, his master of horse, taking Decimus Brutus Albinus with him to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrinking-bout. While they were in their cups the conversation turned on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe question, \"What is the best kind of death for a man?\" Various opinions\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere given, but C\u00e6sar alone expressed the preference for a sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. In this way he foretold his own end, and conversed about what was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen on the morrow. After the banquet a certain bodily faintness came over\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the night, and his wife, Calpurnia, had a dream, in which she saw him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreaming with blood, for which reason she tried to prevent him from going\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout in the morning. When he offered sacrifice there were many unfavorable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns. He was about to send Antony to dismiss the Senate when Decimus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas with him, persuaded him, in order not to incur the charge of disregard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Senate, to go there and dismiss it himself. Accordingly he was borne\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthither in a litter. Games were going on in Pompey's theatre, and the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas about to assemble in one of the adjoining buildings, as was the custom\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the games were taking place. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius were early at the portico in front of the theatre, very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalmly engaging in public business as pr\u00e6tors with those seeking\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir services. When they heard of the bad omens at C\u00e6sar's house\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that the Senate was to be dismissed, they were greatly disconcerted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile they were in this state of mind a certain person took Casca by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand and said, \"You kept the secret from me, although I am your friend, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus has told me all.\" Casca was suddenly conscience-stricken and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshuddered, but his friend, smiling, continued, \"Where shall you get the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney to stand for the \u00e6dileship?\" Then Casca recovered himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Brutus and Cassius were conferring and talking together, Popillius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tL\u00e6na, one of the senators, drew them aside and said that he joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem in his prayers for what they had in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmind, and he urged them to make haste. They were confounded, but remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilent from terror. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While C\u00e6sar was being borne to the Senate one of his intimates, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad learned of the conspiracy, ran to his house to tell what he knew. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\the arrived there and found only Calpurnia he merely said that he wanted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeak to C\u00e6sar about urgent business, and then waited for him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome back from the Senate, because he did not know all the particulars of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe affair. Meantime Artemidorus, whose hospitality C\u00e6sar had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoyed at Cnidus, ran to the Senate and found him already murdered. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttablet informing him of the conspiracy was put into C\u00e6sar's hand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby another person while he was sacrificing in front of the curia, but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent in immediately and it was found in his hand after his death. Directly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter he stepped out of the litter Popillius L\u00e6na, who a little\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore had joined his prayers with the party of Cassius, accosted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and engaged him aside in earnest conversation. The sight of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis proceeding and especially the length of the conversation struck terror\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the hearts of the conspirators, and they made signs to each other that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would kill themselves rather than be captured. As the conversation was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprolonged they saw that L\u00e6na did not seem to be revealing anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto C\u00e6sar, but rather to be urging some petition. They recovered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and when they saw him return thanks to C\u00e6sar after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation they took new courage. It was the custom of the magistrates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen about to enter the Senate, to take the auspices at the entrance. Here\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain C\u00e6sar's first victim was without a heart, or, as some say,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the entrails was wanting. A soothsayer said that this was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsign of death. C\u00e6sar, laughing, said that the same thing had\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappened to him when he was beginning his campaign against Pompeius in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain. The soothsayer replied that he had been in very great danger then and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat now the omen was still more entitled to credence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo C\u00e6sar ordered him to sacrifice again. None of the victims were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore propitious; but being ashamed to keep the Senate waiting, and being\n\t\t\t\t\t\turged by his enemies in the guise of friends, he went in disregarding the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tomens. For it was fated that C\u00e6sar should meet his doom. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The conspirators had left Trebonius, one of their number, to engage Antony in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation at the door. The others, with concealed daggers, stood around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar like friends as he sat in his chair. Then one of them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTillius Cimber, came up in front of him and petitioned him for the recall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this brother, who had been banished. When C\u00e6sar answered that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter must be deferred, Cimber seized hold of his purple robe as though\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill urging his petition, and pulled it away so as to expose his neck,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texclaiming, \"Friends, what are you waiting for?\" Then first Casca, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding over C\u00e6sar's head, drove his dagger at his throat, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmissed his aim and wounded him in the breast. C\u00e6sar snatched his\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoga from Cimber, seized Casca's hand, sprang from his chair, turned around,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand hurled Casca with great violence. While he was in this position another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone stabbed him with a dagger in the side, which was exposed by his turning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius wounded him in the face, Brutus smote him in the thigh, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBucolianus between the shoulder-blades. With rage and outcries\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar turned now upon one and now upon another like a wild animal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut after receiving the wound from Brutus he despaired and, veiling himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his robe, he fell in a decent position at the foot of Pompey's statue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey continued their attack after he had fallen until he had received\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty-three wounds. Several of them while thrusting with their swords\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounded each other. \n\t\t\t\t"},"16":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the murderers had perpetrated their crime, in a sacred place, on one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose person was sacred and inviolable, there was an\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediate flight from the curia and throughout the whole city. Some senators\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere wounded in the tumult and others killed. Many other citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangers were murdered also, not designedly, but as such things happen in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic commotions, by the mistakes of \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t JULIUS C\u00c6SAR AS PONTIFEX MAXIMUS \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the Vatican Museum, Rome \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t those into whose hands they fell. Gladiators, who had been armed early in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmorning for that day's spectacles, ran out of the theatre into the balcony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Senate. The theatre itself was emptied in haste and panic-terror, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe markets were plundered. All citizens closed their front doors and put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves in a posture of defence on their roofs. Antony fortified his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouse, apprehending that the conspiracy was against him as well as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. Lepidus, the master of horse, being in the forum at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, learned what had been done and ran to the island in the river where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a legion of soldiers, which he transferred to the plain in order to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin greater readiness to execute Antony's orders; for he yielded to Antony as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta closer friend of C\u00e6sar and also as consul. While pondering over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe matter they were strongly moved to avenge the death of C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut they feared lest the Senate should espouse the side of the murderers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso they concluded to await events. There had been no military guard around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, for he did not like guards except the usual attendants of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe magistracy. Many civilian officers and a large crowd of citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangers, of slaves and freedmen, had accompanied him from his house to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, but had fled en masse, all except three slaves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho placed the body in a litter and, with uneven step (being an uneven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber), bore him homeward who, a little before, had been master of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearth and sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The murderers wished to make a speech in the Senate, but as nobody remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere they wrapped their togas around their left arms to serve as shields,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, with swords still reeking with blood, ran, crying out that they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain a king and tyrant. One of them bore a cap on the end of a spear as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsymbol of freedom and exhorted the people to restore the government of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfathers and recall the memory of the elder Brutus and of those who took the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toath together against the ancient kings. With them ran some with drawn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswords who had not participated in the deed, but wanted to share the glory,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong whom were Lentulus Spinther, Favonius, Aquinus, Dolabella, Murcus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatiscus. These did not share the glory, but they suffered punishment with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe guilty. As the people did not flock to them they were disconcerted and\n\t\t\t\t\t\talarmed. Although the Senate had at first fled through ignorance and alarm,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had confidence in it nevertheless as being their own relatives and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends, and oppressed equally with themselves by the tyranny. They had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehensions of the plebeians and of C\u00e6sar's soldiers, many of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom were then present in the city, some lately dismissed from the service\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to whom lands had been allotted; others who had been already settled,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had come in to serve as an escort for C\u00e6sar on his departure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the city. The assassins had fears of Lepidus, too, and of the army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder him in the city, and also of Antony in his character as consul, lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\the should consult the people alone, instead of the Senate, and bring some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearful punishment upon them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this frame of mind they hastened up to the Capitol with their gladiators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere they took counsel and decided to bribe the populace, hoping that if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome would begin to praise the deed others would join in from love of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliberty and longing for the republic. They thought that the Roman people\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still exactly the same as they had heard that they were at the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the elder Brutus expelled the kings. They did not perceive that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere counting on two incompatible things, namely, that people could be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlovers of liberty and bribe-takers at the same time. The latter class were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch easier to find of the two, because the government had been corrupt for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta long time. The plebeians were now much mixed with foreign blood, freedmen\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad equal rights of citizenship with them, and slaves were dressed in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame fashion as their masters. Except in the case of the senatorial rank the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame costume was common to slaves and to free citizens. Moreover the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribution of corn to the poor, which took place in Rome only, drew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthither the lazy, the beggars, the vagrants of all Italy. The multitude of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdischarged soldiers no longer returned one by one to their native places as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformerly, fearing that some of them might be accused of having engaged in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiniquitous wars, but were sent in groups to unjust allotments of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlands and houses belonging to others. These were now encamped in temples and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacred enclosures under one standard, and one person appointed to lead them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto their colony, and as they had already sold their own be longings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparatory to their departure they were in readiness to be bought for any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t From so many men of this kind a considerable crowd was drawn speedily and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout difficulty to the party of Cassius in the forum. These, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbought, did not dare to praise the murder, because they feared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's reputation and doubted what course the rest of the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight take. So they shouted for peace as being for the public advantage, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith one accord recommended this policy to the magistrates, intending by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis device to secure the safety of the murderers; for there could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe no peace without amnesty to them. While they were thus engaged the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tor Cinna, a relative of C\u00e6sar by marriage, made his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearance, advanced unexpectedly into the middle of the forum, laid aside\n\t\t\t\t\t\this pr\u00e6torian robe, as if disdaining the gift of a tyrant, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled C\u00e6sar a tyrant and his murderers tyrannicides. He extolled\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir deed as exactly like that of their ancestors, and ordered that the men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves should be called from the Capitol as benefactors and rewarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith public honors. So spake Cinna, but when the hirelings saw that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunbought portion of the crowd did not agree with them they did not call for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe men in the Capitol, nor did they do anything else but continually demand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t But after Dolabella, a young man of noble family who had been chosen by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar as consul for the remainder of his own year when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to leave the city, and who had put on the consular garb and taken the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother insignia of the office, came forward next and railed against the man\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had advanced him to this dignity and pretended to have been privy to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy against him, and that his hand alone was unwillingly absent --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome say that he even proposed a decree that this day should be consecrated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the birthday of the republic -- then the hirelings took new courage,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeing that they had both a pr\u00e6tor and a consul on their side, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemanded that Cassius and his friends be summoned from the Capitol. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere delighted with Dolabella and thought that now they had a young\n\t\t\t\t\t\toptimate, who was also consul, to oppose against Antony. Only Cassius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Brutus came down, the latter with his hand still bleeding from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twound he had received when he and Cassius were dealing blows at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. When they reached the forum neither of them said anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich betokened humility. On the contrary they praised each other as for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething confessedly admirable. They considered the city fortunate and bore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecial testimony to the merits of Decimus Brutus because he had furnished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem gladiators at a critical moment. They exhorted the people to be like\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir ancestors, who had expelled the kings, although the latter were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texercising the government not by violence like C\u00e6sar, but had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen according to law. They advised the recall of Sextus Pompey (the son\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Pompey the Great, the defender of the republic against C\u00e6sar),\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was still warring against C\u00e6sar's lieutenants in Spain. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso recommended that the tribunes, C\u00e6setius and Marullus, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen deposed by C\u00e6sar, should be recalled from exile. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After they had thus spoken Cassius and Brutus returned directly to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, because they had not yet entire confidence in the present posture\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof affairs. Having first enabled their friends and relatives to come to them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the temple, they chose from among them messengers to treat on their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehalf with Lepidus and Antony for conciliation and the preservation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliberty, and for warding off the evils that would befall the country if they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not come to an agreement. This the messengers asked, not extolling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deed that had been done, however, for they did not dare to do this in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe presence of C\u00e6sar's friends. They asked that it be tolerated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow that it was done, out of pity for the perpetrators (who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactuated, not by hatred toward C\u00e6sar, but by love of country), and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of compassion for the city exhausted by long-continued civil strife, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich a new sedition might deprive of the good men still remaining.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\" If enmity were entertained against certain persons,\" they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, \"it would be an act of impiety to gratify it in a time of public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger. It would be far preferable to sink private animosity in the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweal, or, if anybody were irreconcilable, at least to postpone his private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrievances for the present.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony and Lepidus wished to avenge C\u00e6sar, as I have already said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither on the score of friendship, or of the oaths they had sworn, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they were aiming at the supreme power themselves and thought that\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir course would be easier if so many men of such rank were put out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway at once. But they feared the friends and relatives of these men and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleaning of the rest of the Senate toward them, and especially they feared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus Brutus, who had been chosen by C\u00e6sar governor of Cisalpine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul, which had a large army. So they decided to watch a future opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to try if possible to draw over to themselves the army of Decimus, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas already disheartened by its protracted labors. Having come to this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision, Antony replied to the messengers, \"We shall do nothing from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate enmity, yet in consequence of the crime and of the oaths we have all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsworn to C\u00e6sar, that we would either protect his person or avenge\n\t\t\t\t\t\this death, a solemn regard for our oath requires us to drive out the guilty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to live with a smaller number of innocent men rather than that all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be liable to the divine curse. Yet for our own part, although this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to us the proper course, we will consider the matter with you in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate and we will agree to whatever may be decided in common to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropitious for the city.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus did Antony make a safe answer. The messengers returned their thanks and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent away full of hope, for they had entire confidence that the Senate would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcooperate with them. Antony ordered the magistrates to have the city watched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby night, stationing guards at intervals as in the daytime, and he had fires\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlighted throughout the city. By this means the friends of the murderers were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled to traverse the city the whole night, going to the houses of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators and beseeching them in behalf of these men and of the republic. On\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, the leaders of the colonized soldiers ran about uttering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreats lest they should fail to hold the lands set apart, either already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned or proclaimed to them. And now the more honest citizens began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecover courage when they learned how small was the number of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspirators, and when they remembered C\u00e6sar's merits they became\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch divided in opinion. That same night C\u00e6sar's money and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficial papers were transferred to Antony's house, either because Calpurnia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought that they would be safer there or because Antony ordered it. \n\t\t\t\t"},"17":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While these things were taking place Antony, by means of a notice sent around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby night, called the Senate to meet before daybreak at the temple of Tellus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was very near his own house, because he did not dare to go to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenate-house situated just below the Capitol, where the gladiators were\n\t\t\t\t\t\taiding the conspirators, nor did he wish to disturb the city by bringing in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army. Lepidus, however, did that. As daylight was approaching the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators assembled at the temple of Tellus, including the pr\u00e6tor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna, clothed again in the robe of office which he had cast off the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious day as the gift of a tyrant. Some of the unbribed people and some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof C\u00e6sar's veterans, when they saw him, were indignant that he,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough a relative of C\u00e6sar, should have been the first to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslander him in a public speech, threw stones at him, pursued him, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had taken refuge in a house brought fagots and were about to set it on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfire when Lepidus came up with his soldiers and stopped them. This was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst decided expression of opinion in favor of C\u00e6sar. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\thirelings, and the murderers themselves, were alarmed by it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the Senate only a small number were free from sympathy with the act of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolence and indignant at the murder. Most of them sought to aid the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers in various ways. They proposed first to invite them to be present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder a pledge of safety and sit in council with them, thus changing them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom criminals to judges. Antony did not oppose this because he knew they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not come; and they did not come. Then, in order to test the feeling of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate, some of them extolled the deed openly and without disguise,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled the men tyrannicides, and proposed that they should be rewarded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOthers were opposed to giving rewards, saying that the men did not want them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had not done the deed for the sake of reward, but thought that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould merely be thanked as public benefactors. Still others were opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthanking them and thought that it would be sufficient to grant them\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpunity. Such were the devices to which they resorted, and were trying to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscover which of these courses the Senate would be inclined to accept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst, hoping that after a little that body would be more easily led on by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to the other measures. The honester portion revolted at the murder as\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpious, but out of respect for the great families of the murderers would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot oppose the granting of impunity, yet they were indignant at the proposal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto honor them as public benefactors. Others argued that if impunity were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgranted it would not be fitting to refuse the most ample means of safety.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen one speaker said that honoring them would be dishonoring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, it was answered that it was not permissible to prefer the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests of the dead to those of the living. Another having said plainly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one of two things must be decided beforehand -- either that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was a tyrant or that his murderers were to be pardoned as an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tact of clemency -- the others [C\u00e6sar's enemies] seized upon this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimple proposition and asked that an opportunity be given them of expressing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves by vote concerning the character of C\u00e6sar, under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolemn pledge that, if they voluntarily should give their unbiased judgment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe penalty of the oath should not befall them for having previously voted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's decrees under compulsion -- never willingly and never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil they were in fear for their own lives, after the killing of Pompey and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof numberless others besides Pompey. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony, who had been looking on and waiting, saw that sufficient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterial for discussion had been introduced which was not open to dispute,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the resolved to balk their scheme by exciting fear and anxiety for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves. Seeing a great number of these senators themselves who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignated by C\u00e6sar for city magistracies, priestly offices, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe command of provinces and armies (for, as he was going on a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpedition, he had appointed them for five years), Antony proclaimed silence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas consul and said: \"Those who are asking for a vote on the character of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar ought to consider in the first place that all the things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone and decreed under his government and while he was the chosen ruler of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe state remain in full force. If it is decided that he usurped the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment by violence, his body should be cast out unburied and all his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacts annulled. These acts, to speak briefly, embrace the whole earth and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea, and most of them will stand whether we like them or not, as I shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresently show. Those things which alone belong to us to decide, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey concern us alone, I will propose to you first, so that you may gain a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconception of the more difficult questions from a consideration of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasier ones. Almost all of us have held office under C\u00e6sar; or do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso still, having been chosen thereto by him; or will do so soon, having been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignated in advance by him; for, as you know, he had disposed of the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffices, the yearly magistracies, and the command of provinces and armies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor five years. If you are willing to resign these offices (for this is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentirely in your power), I will put that question to you first and then I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill take up the remaining ones.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having lighted this kind of a firebrand among them, not in reference to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, but to themselves, Antony relapsed into silence. They rose\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately en masse, and with loud clamor protested\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst new elections or submitting their claims to the people. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred to keep a firm hold on what they possessed. Some were opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew elections because they were not of lawful age, or for some other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunavowed reason, and among these was the consul Dolabella himself, who could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot legally stand for an election to that office as he was only twenty-five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears old. Although he had pretended yesterday that he had a share in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy, a sudden change came over him, and now he reviled the majority\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor seeking to confer honor on murderers and dishonoring their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates under the pretext of securing the safety of the former. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged Dolabella himself and the other magistrates to believe that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould obtain for them the same positions from the people's gratitude without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany change of officers, but simply by the more legal method of election in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace of monarchical appointment, and that it would be an additional honor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them to hold the same places under the monarchy and the republic. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese speakers were still talking some of the pr\u00e6tors, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tensnare the opposing faction, laid aside their robes of office as if they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere about to exchange them for a more legal title to their places, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon with the others; but the others did not fall into the trap. They knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these men could not control the future election. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While affairs were proceeding thus, Antony and Lepidus went out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, having been called for by a crowd that had been assembling for some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. When they were perceived in an elevated place, and the shouters had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen with difficulty silenced, one of their number, either of his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolition or because he was prompted, called out, \"Have a care lest you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffer a like fate.\" Antony loosened his tunic and showed him a coat-of-mail\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinside, thus exciting the beholders, as though it were impossible even for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls to be safe without arms. Some cried out that the deed must be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenged, but a greater number demanded peace. To those who called for peace\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony said, \"That is what we are striving for, that it may come and be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpermanent, but it is hard to get security for it when so many oaths and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolemnities were of no avail in the case of C\u00e6sar.\" Then, turning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto those who demanded vengeance, he praised them as more observant of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobligations of oaths and religion, and added, \"I myself would join you and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be the first to call for vengeance if I were not the consul, who must\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcare for what is called expedient rather than for what is just. So these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who are inside tell us. So C\u00e6sar himself perhaps thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen, for the good of the country, he spared those citizens whom he captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin war, and was slain by them.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony had in this way worked upon both parties by turns, those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted to have vengeance on the murderers asked Lepidus to execute it. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus was about to speak those who were standing at a distance asked him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto go down to the forum where all could hear him equally well. So he went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly there, thinking that the crowd was now changing its mind, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had taken his place on the rostra he groaned and wept in plain sight for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome time. Then recovering himself, he said, \"Yesterday I stood with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar here, where now I am com- pelled to ask what you wish me to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo about his murder.\" Many cried out \"Avenge C\u00e6sar.\" The hirelings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouted on the other side, \"Peace for the republic.\" To the latter he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplied, \"Agreed, but what kind of a peace do you mean? By what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\t\toaths shall it be confirmed? We all swore the national oaths to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and we have trampled on them -- we who are considered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost distinguished of the oath-takers.\" Then, turning to those who called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor vengeance, he said, \"C\u00e6sar, that truly sacred and revered man,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas gone from us, but we hesitate to deprive the republic of those who still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain. Our conscript fathers,\" he added, \"are considering these matters,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand this is the opinion of most of them.\" They shouted again, \"Avenge him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourself.\" \"I would like to,\" he replied, \"and it is right that I should do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit even alone, but it is not fitting that you and I should wish to do it\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone, or alone set ourselves up against them.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Lepidus was employing such devices the hirelings, who knew that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambitious, praised him and offered him C\u00e6sar's place as pontifex\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximus. He was delighted. \"Mention this to me later,\" he said, \"if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider me worthy of it,\" whereupon the mercenaries, encouraged by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffer of the priesthood, insisted still more strongly on peace. \"Although it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis contrary to religion and law,\" he said, \"I will do what you wish.\" So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying he returned to the Senate, where Dolabella had consumed all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervening time in unseemly talk about his own office. Antony, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaiting to see what the people would do, looked at Dolabella with derision,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the two were at variance with each other. After enjoying the spectacle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficiently and perceiving that the people would not do anything rashly, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided, under compulsion, to extend protection to the murderers (concealing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe necessity, however, and pretending to act in this way as a matter of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatest favor), and at the same time to have C\u00e6sar's acts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratified and his plans carried into effect by common agreement. Accordingly\n\t\t\t\t\t\the commanded silence again and spoke as follows:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Fellow-citizens, while you have been considering the case of the offenders I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave not joined in the debate. When you called for a vote on C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of on them, I had brought forward, until this moment, only one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's acts. This one threw you into these many present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontroversies, and not without reason, for if we resign our offices we shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfess that we (so many and of such high rank as we are) came by them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundeservedly. Consider the matters that cannot be easily controlled by us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReckon them up by cities and provinces, by kings and princes. Almost all of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese, from the rising to the setting sun, C\u00e6sar either subdued\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor us by force and arms, or organized by his laws, or confirmed in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallegiance by his favors and kindness. Which of these powers do you think\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill consent to be deprived of what they have received, unless you mean to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfill the world with new wars -- you who propose to spare these wretches for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of your exhausted country? But, omitting the more distant dangers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand apprehensions, we have others not only near at hand, but even of our own\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold throughout Italy itself,-- men who are here after receiving the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards of victory, many of them with arms in their hands and in the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganization in which they fought, men assigned to colonies by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar (many thousands of whom are still in the city), -- what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink you they will do if they are deprived of what they have received, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpect to receive, in town and country? The past night showed you a sample.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey were coursing the streets with threats against you who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplicating in behalf of the murderers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Think you that C\u00e6sar's fellow-soldiers will allow his body to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdragged through the streets, dishonored, and cast away unburied -- for our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaws prescribe such treatment for tyrants? Will they consider the rewards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have received for their victories in Gaul and Britain secure, when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho gave them is treated with contumely? What will the Roman people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves do? What the Italians? What ill-will of gods and men will attend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou if you put ignominy upon one who advanced your dominion to shores of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tocean hitherto unknown? Will not such fickleness on our part be held in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater reprobation and condemnation if we vote to confer honor on those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave slain a consul in the senate-house, an inviolable man in a sacred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, in full senate, under the eyes of the gods, and if we dishonor one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom even our enemies honor for his bravery ? I warn you to abstain from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese proceedings as being sacrilegious in themselves and not in our power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI move that all the acts and intentions of C\u00e6sar be ratified and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the authors of the crime be by no means applauded (for that would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither pious, nor just, nor consistent with the ratification of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's acts). Let them be spared, if you please, as an act of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclemency only, for the sake of their families and friends, if the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill accept it in this sense in behalf of the murderers and acknowledge it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the light of a favor.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony had said these things with intense feeling and impetuosity, all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe others remaining silent and agreeing, the following decree was passed:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"There shall be no prosecution for the murder of C\u00e6sar, but all of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this acts and decrees are confirmed, because this policy is deemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous to the commonwealth.\" The friends of the murderers insisted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat those last words should be added for their security, implying that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's acts were confirmed as a measure of utility and not of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjustice; and in this matter Antony yielded to them. When this decree had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen voted the leaders of the colonists who were present asked for another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tact special to themselves, in addition to the general one, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirm their colonies. Antony did not oppose this, but rather intimidated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate to pass it. So this was adopted, and another like it concerning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe colonists who had been already sent out. The Senate was thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdismissed, and a number of senators collected around Lucius Piso, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had made the custodian of his will and urged him not to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake the will public, and not to give the body a public funeral, lest some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew disturbance should arise therefrom. As he would not yield they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatened him with a public prosecution for defrauding the people of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan amount of wealth which ought to go into the public treasury; thus giving\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew signs that they were suspicious of a tyranny. \n\t\t\t\t"},"18":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then Piso called out with a loud voice and demanded that the consuls should\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconvene the senators, who were still present, which was done, and then he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid: \"These men who talk of having killed a tyrant are already so many\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrants over us in place of one. They forbid the burying of a Pontifex\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaximus and they threaten me when I produce his will. Moreover, they intend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto confiscate his property as that of a tyrant. They have ratified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's acts as regards themselves, but they annul those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelate to him. It is no longer Brutus or Cassius who do this, but those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstigated them to the murder. Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this burial you are the masters. Of his will I am, and never will I betray\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat has been intrusted to me unless somebody kills me also.\" This speech\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcited clamor and indignation on all sides, and especially among those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thoped that they should obtain something from the will. It was decreed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe will should be read in public and that C\u00e6sar should have a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic funeral. Thereupon the Senate adjourned. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Brutus and Cassius learned what had been done they sent messengers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe plebeians, whom they invited to come up to them at the Capitol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPresently a large number came together and Brutus addressed them as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\" Here, citizens, we meet you, we who yesterday met together with you in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum. We have come hither, not as taking refuge in a sanctuary (for we have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone nothing wrong), nor in a citadel (for as regards our own affairs we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrust ourselves to you), but the sudden and unexpected attack made upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna compelled us to do so. I know that our enemies accuse us of perjury\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand say that we render a lasting peace difficult. What we have to reply to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese accusations we will say in your presence, citizens, with whose help we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall do what remains to be done for the restoration of democratic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. After Gaius C\u00e6sar advanced from Gaul with hostile arms\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his country, and Pompey, the most popular man among you, suffered as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the did, and after him a great number of other good citizens, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven into Africa and Spain, had perished, C\u00e6sar was naturally\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehensive, although his power was firmly intrenched, and we granted him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamnesty at his request and confirmed it by oath. If he had required us to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswear not only to condone the past, but to be willing slaves for the future,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat would our present accusers have done? For my part I think that, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, they would have chosen to die many times rather than take an oath of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary servitude. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"If C\u00e6sar did no more against your liberty then are we perjured.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut if he restored to you neither the magistracies of the city nor those of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe provinces, neither the command of armies, the priestly offices, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership of colonies, nor any other posts of honor; if he neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulted the Senate about anything nor asked the authority of the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut if C\u00e6sar's command was all in all; if he was not even ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsatiated with our misfortunes as Sulla was (for Sulla, when he had destroyed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this enemies restored to you the government of the commonwealth, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, as he was going away for another long military expedition,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated by his appointments your elections for five years), what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom was this in which not a ray of hope could be any longer discerned?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat shall I say of the defenders of the people, C\u00e6setius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarullus?

If this were all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you had done you would perhaps be ashamed to ask reward for such\n\t\t\t\t\t\texploits, but since neither envy, nor time, nor the forgetfulness of men can\n\t\t\t\t\t\textinguish the glory of your deeds in Gaul and Britain, you shall have the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards due to them, such as the people gave to those who served in the army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof old, yet not by taking land from your unoffending fellow-citizens, nor by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdividing other people's property with new-comers, nor by considering it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproper to requite your services by means of acts of injustice. When our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancestors overcame their enemies they did not take from them all their land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey shared it with them and colonized a portion of it with Roman soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were to serve as guards over the vanquished. If the conquered territory\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not sufficient for the colonies, they added some of the public domain or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbought other land with the public money. In this way the people colonized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou without harm to anybody. But Sulla and C\u00e6sar, who invaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir country like a foreign land and needed guards and garrisons against\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own country, did not dismiss you to your homes, nor buy land for you,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor divide among you the property of citizens which they confiscated, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid they make compensation for the relief of those who were despoiled,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough those who despoiled them had plenty of money from the treasury and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplenty from confiscated estates. They took, by the law of war, -- nay, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe practice of robbery, -- from Italians who had committed no offence, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad done no wrong, their land and houses, tombs and temples, which we do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake away even from foreign enemies, except a mere tenth of their produce by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway of tax. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"They divided among you the property of your own people, the very ones who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent you with C\u00e6sar to the Gallic war, and who offered up their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprayers at your festival of victory. They colonized you in that way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollectively, under your standards and in your military organization, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you could neither enjoy peace nor be free from fear of those whom you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplaced. The man who is driven out and deprived of his goods will always\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe watching his opportunity to ensnare you. This was the very thing that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrants sought to accomplish, -- not to provide you with land, which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould have obtained for you elsewhere; but that you, because always beset by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlurking enemies, might be the firm bulwark of a government that was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitting wrongs in common with you. A common interest between tyrants and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir satellites grows out of common crimes and common fears. And this, ye\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgods, they call colonization, in which are common the lamentations of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkindred people and the expulsion of innocent men from their homes. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposely made you enemies to your countrymen for their own advantage. We,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe defenders of the republic, to whom our opponents say they grant safety\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of pity, confirm this very same land to you and will confirm it forever;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to this promise we call to witness the god of this temple. You have and shall keep what you have received. None of us\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill take it from you, neither Brutus, nor Cassius, nor any of us who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincurred danger for your freedom. The one thing wanting in this business we\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill supply -- a reconciliation with your fellow-countrymen most agreeable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them now, as they hear that we shall at once pay them out of the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney the price of this land of which they have been deprived; so that not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly shall your colony be secure, but it shall not even be exposed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Brutus was still speaking in this sort, and after the assembly was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolved, his discourse was approved by all as being entirely just. He and\n\t\t\t\t\t\this associates were admired as men of intrepidity, and as peculiarly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends of the people. The latter were favorably inclined toward them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to co\u00f6perate with them on the following day. At daybreak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls called the people to an assembly and communicated to them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecisions of the Senate, and Cicero pronounced a long encomium on the decree\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof amnesty. The people were delighted with it and invited Cassius and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends to come down from the Capitol. The latter asked that hostages be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent to them in the meantime, and, accordingly, the sons of Antony and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus were sent. When Brutus and his associates made their appearance they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere received with shouts of applause, and when the consuls desired to say\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething the people would not allow them to do so, but demanded that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould first shake hands with these men and make peace with them, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone. The minds of the consuls were much disturbed by fear and envy lest the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspirators should get the upper hand of them in other political\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatters. \n\t\t\t\t"},"19":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t C\u00e6sar's will was now produced and the people ordered that it be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tread at once. In it Octavius, the grandson of his sister, was adopted by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. His gardens were given to the people as a place of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecreation, and to every Roman still living in the city he gave seventy-five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttic drachmas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe people were again stirred to anger when they saw the will of this lover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his country, whom they had before heard accused of tyranny. Most of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid it seem pitiful to them that Decimus Brutus, one of the murderers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould have been named by him for adoption in the second degree; for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary for the Romans to name alternate heirs in case of the failure of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first. Whereupon there was still greater disturbance among the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho considered it shocking and sacrilegious that Decimus should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspired against C\u00e6sar when he had been adopted as his son. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPiso brought C\u00e6sar's body into the forum a countless multitude ran\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with arms to guard it, and with acclamations and magnificent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplay placed it on the rostra. Wailing and lamentation were renewed for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong time, the armed men clashed their shields, and gradually they began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepent themselves of the amnesty. Antony, seeing how things were going, did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot abandon his purpose, but, having been chosen to deliver the funeral\n\t\t\t\t\t\toration, as a consul for a consul, a friend for a friend, a relative for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelative (for he was related to C\u00e6sar on his mother's side),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresumed his artful design and spoke as follows:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It is not fitting, citizens, that the funeral oration of so great a man\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be pronounced by me alone, but rather by his whole country. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrees which all of us, in equal admiration of his merit, voted to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was alive -- the Senate and the people acting together -- I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tread, so that I may voice your sentiments rather than my own.\" Then he began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto read with a severe and gloomy countenance, pronouncing each sentence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinctly and dwelling especially on those decrees which declared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar to be superhuman, sacred, and inviolable, and which named\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim the father of his country, or the benefactor, or the chieftain without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeer. With each decree Antony turned his face and his hand toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's corpse, illustrating his discourse by his action, and at\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach appellation he added some brief remark full of grief and indignation;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas, for example, where the decree spoke of C\u00e6sar as the father of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this country he added that this was a testimonial of his clemency; and again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he was made sacred and inviolable and everybody else was to be held\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunharmed who should find refuge with him,-- \"Nobody,\" said Antony, \"who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound refuge with him was harmed, but he, whom you declared sacred and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinviolable, was killed, although he did not extort these honors from you as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tyrant, and did not even ask for them. Most servile are we if we give such\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors to the unworthy who do not ask for them. But you, faithful citizens,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvindicate us from this charge of servility by paying such honors as you now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpay to the dead.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony resumed his reading and recited the oaths by which all were pledged to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard C\u00e6sar and C\u00e6sar's body with all their strength,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand all were devoted to perdition who should not avenge him against any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy. Here, lifting up his voice and extending his hand toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, he exclaimed, \"Jupiter, guardian of this city, and ye other gods, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstand ready to avenge him as I have sworn and vowed, but since those who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof equal rank with me have considered the decree of amnesty beneficial, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpray that it may prove so.\" A commotion arose among the senators in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of this exclamation, which seemed to have special reference to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. So Antony quieted them again and recanted, saying, \"It seems to me,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizens, that this deed is not the work of human beings, but of some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevil spirit. It becomes us to consider the present rather than the past,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the greatest danger approaches, if it is not already here, lest we be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrawn into our former civil commotions and lose whatever remains of noble\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirth in the city. Let us then conduct this sacred one to the abode of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblest, chanting our accustomed hymn of lamentation for him.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having spoken thus,, he gathered up his garments like one inspired, girded\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself so that he might have the free use of his hands, took his position\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin front of the bier as in a play, bending down to it and rising again, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsang first as to a celestial deity. In order to testify to C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgodlike origin, he raised his hands to heaven and with rapid speech recited\n\t\t\t\t\t\this wars, his battles, his victories, the nations he had brought under his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry's sway, and the spoils he had sent home, extolling each exploit as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmiraculous, and all the time exclaiming, \"Thou alone hast come forth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunvanquished from all the battles thou hast fought. Thou alone hast avenged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthy country of the out-rage put upon it 300 years ago, bringing to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknees those savage tribes, the only ones that ever broke into and burned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity of Rome.\" Many other things Antony said in a kind of divine frenzy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen lowered his voice from its high pitch to a sorrowful tone, and mourned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wept as for a friend who had suffered unjustly, and prayed that his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife might be given in exchange for C\u00e6sar's. Carried away by\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme passion he uncovered the body of C\u00e6sar, lifted his robe on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe point of a spear and shook it aloft, pierced with dagger-thrusts and red\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the dictator's blood. Whereupon the people, like a chorus, mourned with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the most lugubrious manner, and from sorrow became again filled with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanger. After the discourse other lamentations were chanted with funeral\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmusic according to the national custom, by the people in chorus, to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead; and his deeds and his sad fate were again recited. Somewhere from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmidst of these lamentations C\u00e6sar himself was supposed to speak,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecounting the benefits he had conferred on his enemies by name, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaking of the murderers themselves, exclaiming, as it were, \" Oh that I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould have spared these men to slay me!\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe people could endure it no longer. It seemed to them monstrous that all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe murderers who, with the single exception of Decimus Brutus, had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade prisoners while belonging to the faction of Pompey, and who, instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing punished, had been advanced by C\u00e6sar to the magistracies of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome and to the command of provinces and armies, should have conspired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him; and that Decimus should have been deemed by him worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadoption as his son. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were in this temper and were already near to violence, somebody\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised above the bier an image of C\u00e6sar himself made of wax. The body\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself, as it lay on its back on the couch, could not be seen. The image was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned round and round by a mechanical device, showing the twenty-three\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounds in all parts of the body and on the face, which gave him a shocking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearance. The people could no longer bear the pitiful sight presented to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. They groaned, and, girding themselves, they burned the senate-chamber\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere C\u00e6sar was slain, and ran hither and thither searching for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe murderers, who had fled some time previously. They were so mad with rage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand grief that like wild beasts they tore in pieces the tribune Cinna on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of his similarity of name to the praetor Cinna who had made a speech\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst C\u00e6sar, not waiting to hear any explanation about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimhilarity of name, so that no part of him was ever found for burial. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried fire to the houses of the other murderers, but the domestics\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaliantly fought them off and the neighbors besought them to desist. So the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople abstained from the use of fire, but they threatened to come back with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarms on the following day. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The murderers fled from the city secretly. The people returned to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's bier and bore it as a consecrated thing to the Capitol in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to bury it in the temple and place it among the gods. Being prevented\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom doing so by the priests, they placed it again in the forum where in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tolden time stood the palace of the kings of Rome. There they collected\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether sticks of wood and benches, of which there were many in the forum,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand anything else they could find of that sort, for a funeral pile, throwing\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton it the adornments of the procession, some of which were very costly. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them cast their own crowns upon it and many military gifts. Then they set\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfire to it, and the entire people remained by the funeral pile throughout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe night. There an altar was first erected, but now there stands the temple of C\u00e6sar himself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas he was deemed worthy of divine honors; for Octavius, his son by adoption,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho took the name of C\u00e6sar, and, following in the footsteps of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter in political matters, greatly strengthened the government founded by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, and which remains to this day, decreed divine honors to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather. From this example the Romans now pay like honors to each emperor at\n\t\t\t\t\t\this death if he has not reigned in a tyrannical manner or made himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\todious, although at first they could not bear to call them kings while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliving. \n\t\t\t\t"},"20":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So died Gaius C\u00e6sar on the so-called Ides of March, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrespond nearly with the middle of the Greek month Anthesterion, which day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soothsayer predicted that he should not survive. C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjokingly said to him early in the morning, \"Well, the Ides have come,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter, nothing daunted, answered, \"But they are not past.\" Despising\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch prophecies, uttered with so much confidence by the soothsayer, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother prodigies that I have previously mentioned, C\u00e6sar went on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this way and was killed, being fifty-six years of age. He was a man most fortunate in all things, superhuman,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof grand designs, and fit to be compared with Alexander. Both were men of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest ambition, both were most skilled in the art of war, most rapid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin executing their decisions, most reckless of danger, least sparing of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, and relying as much on audacity and luck as on military skill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander made a long journey through the desert in the hot season to visit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oracle of Ammon and crossed the Gulf of Pamphylia against a head sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessfully. A god restrained the waves for him until he had passed over,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sent him rain on his journey by land. In India he ventured upon an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunknown sea. Once he was the first to ascend the scaling ladders and leaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the wall among his enemies alone, and in this condition received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirteen wounds. Yet he was never defeated, and he finished almost every war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin one or two battles. He conquered many barbarians in Europe and made\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself master of Greece, a people hard to control, fond of freedom, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboasted that they had never obeyed anybody before him, except Philip for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle while under the guise of his leadership in war. He overran almost the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole of Asia. To sum up Alexander's fortune and power in a word, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquired as much of the earth as he saw, and died while he was devising\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans to capture the rest. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Adriatic Sea yielded to C\u00e6sar, becoming navigable and quiet in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmid-winter. He also crossed the western ocean to Britain, which had never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen attempted before, and he ordered his pilots to break their ships in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpieces by running them on the rocks of the British coast. He was exposed to the violence of another tempest\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen alone in a small boat by night, and he ordered the pilot to spread his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsails and to keep in mind C\u00e6sar's fortune rather than the waves of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea. He often dashed against the enemy single-handed when all others\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere afraid. He fought thirty pitched battles in Gaul alone, where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquered forty nations so formidable to the Romans previously that in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw which exempted priests and old men from military enrolment an exception\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas made of a Gallic war, in case of which priests and old men were required\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto serve in the army. Once in the course of the Alexandrian war, when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft alone on a bridge in extreme peril, he threw off his purple garment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleaped into the sea, and, being sought by the enemy, swam under water a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance, coming to the surface only at intervals to take breath, until he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame near a friendly ship, when he made himself known by raising his hands,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was saved. In these civil wars, in which he engaged either through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehension, as he says, or ambition, he was brought in conflict with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst generals of the age and with many large armies, not now of barbarians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut of Romans in the highest state of efficiency and good fortune, and, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander, he overcame them all by one or two engagements with each. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces were not, like Alexander's, always victorious, for they were defeated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Gauls most disastrously under the command of his lieutenants, Cotta\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Titurius; and in Spain Petreius and Afranius shut them up like an army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged. At Dyrrachium and in Africa they were put to flight, and in Spain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were terrified by young Pompey. But C\u00e6sar himself was always\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundaunted and was victorious at the end of every war. He grasped, partly by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce, partly by good-will, the Roman power which ruled the earth and sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the setting sun to the river Euphrates, and held it much more firmly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand strongly than Sulla had done, and he showed himself to be a king in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspite of opposition, even though he did not accept the title. And, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander, he expired while planning new wars. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Their armies were equally zealous and devoted to both, and in battles they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought with the greatest ferocity, but were often disobedient and mutinous\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton account of the severity of their tasks. Yet they mourned and longed for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir commanders when they were dead, and paid them divine honors. Both were\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-formed and handsome in person, and both were descended from Jupiter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander through \u00c6acus and Hercules, C\u00e6sar through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnchises and Venus. Both were as prompt to fight their adversaries as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere ready to make peace and grant pardon to the vanquished, and after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpardon to confer benefits; for they desired only to conquer. Thus far let\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe parallel hold good, although they did not both start toward empire from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same footing; Alexander from the monarchy founded by Philip,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar from a private station, well born and illustrious indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut very short of money. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Both of them despised the prodigies relating to themselves, but they did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal harshly with the sooth-sayers who predicted their death; for more than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce the very same prodigies confronted both, pointing to the same end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTwice in the case of each the victims were without a liver, and the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime it indicated a doubtful danger. It happened to Alexander when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the Oxydrac\u00e6 and while he was leading his Macedonians in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscaling the enemy's wall. The ladder broke, leaving him alone on the top.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking counsel of his courage, he leaped inside the town against his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, and was struck severely in the breast and on the neck by a very\n\t\t\t\t\t\theavy club, so that he fell down, and was rescued with difficulty by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonians, who broke down the gates in their alarm for him. It happened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar in Spain while his army was in great fear of young Pompey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand hesitated to join battle. C\u00e6sar dashed in advance of all into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe space between the armies, and received 200 darts on his shield until his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, moved by shame and fear for his safety, rushed forward and rescued\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. Thus in the case of each the first victims without livers presaged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger of death; the second presaged death itself. As Peithagoras, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayer, was inspecting the entrails, he told Apollodorus, who was in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of Alexander and Hephestion, not to be afraid of them, because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould both be out of the way very soon. Hephestion died immediately, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus, being apprehensive lest some conspiracy might exist against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander, communicated the prophecy to him. Alexander smiled, and asked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeithagoras himself what the prodigy meant. When the latter replied that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant fatality, he smiled again. Nevertheless, he commended Apollodorus for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this good-will and the soothsayer for his freedom of speech. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As C\u00e6sar was entering the Senate for the last time, as I have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshortly before related, the same omens were observed, but he said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjestingly, that the same thing had happened to him in Spain. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayer replied that he was in danger then too, and that the omen was now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore deadly, he yielded somewhat to the warning and sacrificed again, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to do so until he became vexed with the priests for delaying him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand went in and was killed. The same kind of thing happened to Alexander. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was returning from India to Babylon with his army, and was nearing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter place, the Chaldeans urged him to postpone his entrance for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent. He replied with the iambic verse, \"He who guesses right is the best\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprophet.\" Again, the Chaldeans urged him not to march his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the city while looking toward the setting sun, but to go around and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenter facing the east. It is said that he yielded to this suggestion and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted to go around, but being bothered by a lake and marshy ground, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarded this second prophecy also, and entered the city looking toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe west. Not long after entering he went down the Euphrates in a boat to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Pallacotta, which takes its water from the Euphrates and carries\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit away in marshes and ponds and thus hinders the irrigation and navigation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Assyrian country. While he was considering how he should dyke this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstream and while he was sailing out to it for this purpose, it is said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the jeered at the Chaldeans because he had gone into Babylon and sailed out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it safely. But scarcely had he returned back to it when he died.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar jeered at the prophecies in like manner, for the soothsayer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpredicted the day of his death, saying that he should not survive the Ides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof March, and when the day came C\u00e6sar mocked him saying, \"The Ides\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave come \"; and the same day he died. Thus both alike made light of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprophecies concerning themselves, and were not angry at the soothsayers who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuttered them, yet they became the inevitable victims of the prophecies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Both were students of the science and arts of their own country, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreece, and of foreign nations. As to those of India, Alexander interrogated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Brahmins who seem to be the astronomers and learned men of that country,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the Magi among the Persians. C\u00e6sar likewise interrogated the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptians while he was there restoring Cleopatra to the throne, by which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans he made many improvements among the peaceful arts for the Romans. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged the calendar, which was still in disorder by reason of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintercalary months till then in use, for the Romans reckoned the year by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoon. C\u00e6sar changed it to the sun's course, as the Egyptians\n\t\t\t\t\t\treckoned it. It happened in his case\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat not one of the conspirators against him escaped, but all were brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto condign punishment by his adopted son, just as the murderers of Philip\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere by Alexander. How they were punished the succeeding books will show. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t MARK ANTONY \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the Vatican Museum, Rome \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"}},"2":{"0":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Senate blamed Antony for his funeral oration over C\u00e6sar, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich, chiefly, the people were incited to disregard the decree of amnesty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlately passed, and to scour the city in order to fire the houses of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers. But he changed it from bad to good feeling toward himself by one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital stroke of policy. There was a certain pseudo-Marius in Rome named\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmatius. He pretended to be a grandson of Marius, and for this reason was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopular with the masses. Being, according to this pretence, a relative of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, he was pained beyond measure by the latter's death, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\terected an altar on the site of his funeral pyre. He collected a band of\n\t\t\t\t\t\treckless men and made himself a perpetual terror to the murderers. Some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese had fled from the city, and those who had accepted the command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces from C\u00e6sar himself had gone away to take charge of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame, Decimus Brutus to Cisalpine Gaul, Trebonius to Asia adjoining Ionia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Tillius Cimber to Bithynia. Cassius and Marcus Brutus, who were the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecial favorites of the Senate, had been chosen by C\u00e6sar as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernors for the following year, the former of Syria, and the latter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia. Being still city pr\u00e6tors, they remained there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily, and in their official capacity they conciliated the colonists\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby various decrees, and among others by one enabling them to sell their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallotments, the law hitherto forbidding the alienation of the land till the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of twenty years. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t It was said that Amatius was only waiting an opportunity to entrap Brutus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius. On the rumor of this plot, Antony, using his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsular authority, arrested Amatius and boldly put him to death without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial. The senators were astonished at this deed as an act of violence and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to law, but they enjoyed it exceedingly because they thought that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe situation of Brutus and Cassius would never be safe without such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldness. The followers of Amatius, and the plebeians generally, missing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmatius and feeling indignation at the deed, and especially because it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen done by Antony, whom the people had honored, determined that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be scorned in that way. With shouts they took possession of the forum,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texclaiming against Antony and called on the magistrates, in place of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmatius, to dedicate the altar and to offer the first sacrifices on it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. Having been driven out of the forum by soldiers sent by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, they became still more indignant, and vociferated more loudly, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of them showed places where C\u00e6sar's statues had been torn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom their pedestals. One man told them that he could show a shop where the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatues had been broken up. The others followed, and having witnessed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact, they set fire to the place. Finally, Antony sent more soldiers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of those who resisted were killed, others were captured, and of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slaves were crucified and the freemen thrown over the Tarpeian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So this tumult was quieted. The extreme fondness of the plebeians for Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas turned into extreme hatred. The Senate was delighted, because it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that Brutus and his associates could not rest secure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\totherwise. Antony also moved that Sextus Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(the son of Pompey the Great, who was still much beloved by all) should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecalled from Spain, where he was still at war with C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlieutenants, and that he should be paid 50,000,000 of Attic drachmas out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic treasury for his father's confiscated property and be appointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommander of the sea, as his father had been, with charge of all the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships, wherever situated, which were needed for immediate service. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tastonished Senate accepted each of these decrees with alacrity and applauded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony the whole day; for nobody, in their estimation, was more devoted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe republic than the elder Pompey, and hence nobody was more regretted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius and Brutus, who were of Pompey's faction, and the ones most honored\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby all at that time, thought that they would be entirely safe. They thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat what they had done would be confirmed, and the republic be at last\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestored, and their party successful. Wherefore Cicero praised Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinually, and the Senate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperceiving that the plebeians were making plots against him on its account,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed him a guard for his personal safety, chosen by himself from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveterans who were sojourning in the city. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony, either because he had done everything for this very purpose, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseizing the happy chance as very useful to him, enlisted his guard and kept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadding to it till it amounted to 6000 men. They were not common soldiers. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought that he should easily get the latter for his service otherwise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese were composed wholly of centurions, as being fit for command, and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong experience in war, and his own acquaintances through service under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. He appointed tribunes over them, chosen from their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber and adorned with military decoration, and these he held in honor and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade sharers of his public councils. The Senate began to be suspicious of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe number of his guards, and of his care in choosing them, and advised him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reduce them to a moderate number so as to avoid invidious remarks. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to do so as soon as the disorder among the plebeians should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquieted. It had been decreed that all the things done by C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand all that he intended to do, should be ratified. The memoranda of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's intentions were in Antony's possession, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's secretary, Faberius, was obedient to him in every way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince C\u00e6sar himself, on the point of his departure, had placed all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpetitions of this kind in Antony's discretion. Antony made many additions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to secure the favor of many persons. He made gifts to cities, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinces, and to his own guards, and although all were advised that these\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere C\u00e6sar's memoranda, yet the recipients knew that the favor was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to Antony. In the same way he enrolled many new names in the list of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators and did many other things to please the Senate, in order that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight not bear him ill-will in reference to his guards. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Antony was busy with these matters, Brutus and Cassius, seeing nobody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong either the plebeians or the veterans inclined to be at peace with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, and considering that any other person might lay plots against them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike that of Amatius, became distrustful of the fickleness of Antony, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow had an army under his command. Seeing that the republic was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed by deeds, they suspected Antony for that reason also. They reposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost confidence in Decimus Brutus, who had three legions near by. They sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly to Trebonius in Asia and to Tillius in Bithynia, asking them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect money quietly and to prepare an army. They were anxious to enter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon the government of the provinces assigned to them by C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut as the time for doing so had not yet come, they thought that it would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindecorous for them to leave their service as city pr\u00e6tors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfinished, and that they should incur the suspicion of an undue longing for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower over the provinces. They preferred, nevertheless, to spend the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of their year as private citizens somewhere, as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity, rather than serve as praetors in the city where they were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafe, and were not held in honor corresponding to the benefits they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconferred upon their country. Being in this state of mind, and the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholding the same opinion as themselves, the latter gave them charge of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply of corn for the city from all parts of the world until the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould arrive for them to take command of their provinces. This was done in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder that Brutus and Cassius might not at any time seem to have fled. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat was the anxiety and regard for them that the Senate cared for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother murderers chiefly on their account. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After Brutus and Cassius had left the city, Antony, being in possession of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething like monarchical power, cast about for the government of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince and an army for himself. He desired that of Syria most of all, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was not ignorant of the fact that he was under suspicion and that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be more so if he should ask for it; for the Senate had secretly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged Dolabella, the other consul, to oppose Antony, as the former had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways been at variance with the latter. Antony, knowing that this young\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella was himself ambitious, persuaded him to solicit the province of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria and the army enlisted against the Parthians, in place of Cassius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ask it, not from the Senate, which had not the power to grant it, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the people by a law. Dolabella was delighted, and immediately brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward the law. The Senate accused him of nullifying the decrees of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. He replied that C\u00e6sar had not assigned the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the Parthians to anybody, and that Cassius, who had been assigned to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe command of Syria, had himself been the first to alter the decrees of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar by authorizing colonists to sell their allotments before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpiration of the legal period of twenty years. He said also that it would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe an indignity to himself if he, being Dolabella, were not chosen for Syria instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius. The Senate then persuaded one of the tribunes, named Asprenas, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalsify the signs in the sky during the comitia, expecting that Antony, who was both consul and augur,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was supposed to be still at variance with Dolabella, would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perate with him. But when the voting came on, and Asprenas said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the signs in the sky were unfavorable, as it was not his business to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattend to this, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE YOUNG OCTAVIUS \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Vatican Museum (Duruy) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Antony, angry at his lying, ordered that the tribes should go on with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoting on the subject of Dolabella. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus Dolabella became governor of Syria and general of the war against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParthians and of the forces enlisted for that purpose by C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with those that had gone in advance to Macedonia. Then it became\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknown for the first time that Antony was co\u00f6perating with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella. After this business had been transacted by the people, Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolicited the province of Macedonia from the Senate, well knowing that after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria had been given to Dolabella, they would be ashamed to deny Macedonia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto himself, especially as it was a province without an army. They gave it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim unwillingly, at the same time wondering why Antony should let Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave the army, but glad nevertheless that the latter had it rather than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer. They themselves took the opportunity to ask of Antony other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces for Brutus and Cassius. They assigned to them Cyrenaica and Crete;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor, as some say, both of these to Cassius and Bithynia to Brutus. Such was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe state of affairs at Rome. \n\t\t\t\t"},"1":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius, the son of the daughter of C\u00e6sar's sister, had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed master of C\u00e6sar's horse for one year, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar at times made this a yearly office, passing it around among\n\t\t\t\t\t\this friends. Being still a young man, he had been sent by C\u00e6sar to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollonia on the Adriatic to be educated and trained in the art of war, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he might accompany C\u00e6sar on his expeditions. Troops of horse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Macedonia were sent to him by turns for the purpose of drill, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain army officers visited him frequently as a relative of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. As he received all with kindness, an acquaintance and good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeeling grew up by means of them between himself and the army. At the end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta six months' sojourn in Apollonia, it was announced to him one evening that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had been killed in the senate-house by those who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdearest to him, and were then the most powerful ones under him. As the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the story was untold he was overcome by fear, not knowing whether the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeed had been committed by the Senate as a whole or was confined to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediate actors; nor whether they had already been punished by the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor would be, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether the people were pleased with what had been done. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thereupon his Roman friends advised him to take refuge with the army in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia to insure his personal safety, and that when he should learn that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe murder was only a private transaction he should take courage and avenge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar of his enemies; and there were high officers who promised to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotect him if he would come. But his mother and his stepfather, Philippus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrote to him from Rome not to be too confident and not to attempt anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\trash, but to bear in mind what C\u00e6sar, after conquering every\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, had suffered at the hands of his closest friends; that it would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafer under present circumstances to choose a private life and hasten to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem at Rome, but with caution. Octavius yielded to them because he did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow what had happened after C\u00e6sar's death. He took leave of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy officers and crossed the Adriatic, not to Brundusium (for as he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade no test of the army at that place he avoided all risk), but to another\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttown not far from it and out of the direct route, named Lupi\u00e6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere he took lodgings and remained for a while. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When more accurate information about the murder and the public grief had\n\t\t\t\t\t\treached him, together with copies of C\u00e6sar's will and the decrees\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Senate, his relatives still cautioned him to beware of the enemies of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, as he was the latter's adopted son and heir. They even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvised him to renounce the adoption, together with the inheritance. But he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought that to do so, and not to avenge C\u00e6sar, would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisgraceful. So he went to Brundusium, first sending in advance to see that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnone of the murderers had laid any trap for him. When the army there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced to meet him, and received him as C\u00e6sar's son, he took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourage, offered sacrifice, and immediately assumed the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar; for it is customary among the Romans for the adopted son to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the name of the adoptive father. He not only assumed it, but he changed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own name and his patronymic completely, calling himself C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe son of C\u00e6sar, instead of Octavius the son of Octavius, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to do so ever after. Directly multitudes of men from all sides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflocked to him as C\u00e6sar's son, some from friendship to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, others his freedmen and slaves, and with them other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers, who were either engaged in conveying supplies and money to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy in Macedonia, or bringing other money and tribute from other countries\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Brundusium. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Encouraged by the numbers who were joining him, and by the glory of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, and by the good-will of all toward himself, he journeyed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome with a notable crowd which, like a torrent, grew larger and larger each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday. Although he was safe from any open attacks by reason of the multitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding him, he was all the more on his guard against secret ones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause almost all of those accompanying him were new acquaintances. Some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe towns were not altogether favorable to him, but C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveterans, who had been distributed in colonies, flocked from their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsettlements to greet the young man. They bewailed C\u00e6sar, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcursed Antony for not proceeding against the monstrous crime, and said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would avenge it if anybody would lead them. Octavius praised them, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostponed the matter for the present and sent them away. When he had arrived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Tarracina, about 400 stades from Rome, he received news that Cassius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus had been deprived of Syria and Macedonia by the consuls, and had\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived the smaller provinces of Cyrenaica and Crete by way of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompensation; that certain exiles had returned; that Sextus Pompey had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecalled; that some new members had been added to the Senate in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith C\u00e6sar's memoranda, and that many other things were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thappening. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When he arrived at the city his mother and Philippus and the others who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterested in him were anxious about the estrangement of the Senate from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, and the decree that his murderers should not be punished,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the contempt shown him by Antony, who was then all-powerful, and had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither gone to meet C\u00e6sar's son when he was coming nor sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody to him. Octavius quieted their fears, saying that he would call on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, as the younger man on the older and the private citizen on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul, and that he would show proper respect for the Senate. As for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecree, he said that it had been passed because nobody had prosecuted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers; whenever anybody should have courage to prosecute, the people and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate would lend their aid to him as one enforcing the law, the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould do so for the justice of his cause, and perhaps Antony himself would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelp. If he (Octavius) should reject the inheritance and the adoption, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be false to C\u00e6sar and would wrong the people who had a share\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the will. As he was finishing his remarks he burst out that he ought not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly to incur danger, but even to die, after he had been preferred before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall others in this way by C\u00e6sar, if he would show himself worthy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof one who had himself braved every danger. Then turning to his mother, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepeated the words of Achilles to Thetis, which were then fresh in his mind:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-- \"Then quickly let me die since fate denied That I should aid my\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfriend against the foes That slew him.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Iliad, xviii. 98, Bryant's translation. \n\t\t\t\t\t After saying this he added that these words of Achilles, and especially the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeed that followed, had of all things given him immortal renown; and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvoked C\u00e6sar not as a friend, but a father; not as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-soldier, but a commander-in-chief; not as one who had fallen by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw of war, but as the victim of sacrilegious murder in the senate-house. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thereupon his mother's anxiety was changed to joy, and she embraced him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only one worthy of C\u00e6sar. She checked his speaking and urged\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to prosecute his designs with the favor of fortune. She advised him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, to use art and patience rather than open boldness. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproved of this policy and promised to adopt it in action, and forthwith\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent around to his friends the same evening, asking them to come to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum early in the morning and bring a crowd with them. There presenting\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself to Gaius Antonius, the brother of Antony, who was the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tor, he said that he accepted the adoption of C\u00e6sar;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it is a Roman custom that adoptions are confirmed by witnesses before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pr\u00e6tors. When the public scribes had taken down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclaration, Octavius went from the forum straightway to Antony. The latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas in the gardens that C\u00e6sar had given to him, that had formerly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen Pompey's. As Octavius was kept waiting at the vestibule for some time,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the interpreted the fact as a sign of Antony's displeasure. When he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmitted there were greetings and mutual questionings proper to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasion. When the time came to speak of the business in hand, Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid: -- \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Father Antony (for the benefits that C\u00e6sar conferred upon you and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour gratitude toward him warrant me in giving you that title), for some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe things that you have done since his death I praise you and owe you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks; for others I blame you. I shall speak freely of what my sorrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprompts me to speak. When C\u00e6sar was killed you were not present,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the murderers detained you at the door; otherwise you would have saved\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim or incurred the danger of sharing the same fate with him. If the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have befallen you, then it is well that you were not present. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain senators proposed rewards to the murderers as tyrannicides you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly opposed them. For this I give you hearty thanks, although you knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they intended to kill you also; not, as I think,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause you were likely to avenge C\u00e6sar, but, as they themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay, lest you should be his successor in the tyranny. At the same time they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade it clear that they were not tyrant-killers, but murderers, by taking refuge in the Capitol, either as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguilty suppliants in a temple or as enemies in a fortress. How then could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have obtained amnesty and impunity for their crime unless some portion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Senate and people had been corrupted by them? Yet you, as consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tought to have seen what would be for the interest of the majority, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tand if you had wished to avenge such a monstrous crime, or to reclaim the\n\t\t\t\t\t\terring, your office would have enabled you to do either. But you sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostages from your own family to the murderers at the Capitol for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurity. Let us suppose that those who had been corrupted forced you to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis also, yet when C\u00e6sar's will had been read, and you had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered your righteous funeral oration, and the people, in lively\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremembrance of C\u00e6sar, had carried firebrands to the houses of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers, but spared them for the sake of their neighbors, agreeing to come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback armed the next day, why did you not co\u00f6perate with them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlead them with fire or arms? Or why did you not bring them to trial, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial was necessary for men seen in the act of murder -- you,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's friend; you, the consul; you, Antony? \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The pseudo-Marius was put to death by your order in the plenitude of your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority, but you connived at the escape of the murderers, some of whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave passed on to the provinces which they nefariously hold as gifts at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thands of him whom they slew. These things were no sooner done than you and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella, the consuls, proceeded, very properly, to strip them and possess\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourselves of Syria and Macedonia. I should have owed you thanks for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso, had you not immediately voted them Cyrenaica ana Crete; had you not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred these fugitives for governorships, where they can always defend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves against me, and had you not tolerated Decimus Brutus in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand of Hither Gaul, although he, like the rest, was one of my father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslayers. It may be said that these were decrees of the Senate. But you put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vote and you presided over the Senate -- you who ought most of all to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave opposed them on your own account. To grant amnesty to the murderers was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely to insure their personal safety as a matter of favor, but to vote\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem provinces and rewards forthwith was to insult C\u00e6sar and annul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour own opinion. Grief has compelled me to speak these words, against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trules of decorum perhaps, considering my youth and the respect I owe you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey have been spoken, however, to the firmest friend of C\u00e6sar, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone who was invested by him with the greatest honor and power, and who would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been adopted by him no doubt if he had known that you would accept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinship with the family of \u00c6neas in exchange for that of Hercules;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this created doubt in his mind when he was thinking strongly of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignating you as his successor. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"For the future, Antony, I conjure you by the gods who preside over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, and by C\u00e6sar himself, to change somewhat the measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have been adopted, for you can change them if you wish to; if not, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou will hereafter aid and cooperate with me in punishing the murderers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the help of the people and of those who are still my father's faithful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends. If you still have regard for the conspirators and the Senate, do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be hard on us. So much for that. You know about my private affairs and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe expense I must incur for the legacy which my father directed to be given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the people, and the haste involved in it lest I may seem churlish by\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason of delay, and lest those who have been assigned to colonies be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompelled to remain in the city and waste their time on my account. Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's movables, that were brought immediately after the murder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom his house to yours as a safer place, I beg you to take keepsakes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything else by way of ornament and whatever you like to retain from us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut in order that I may pay the legacy to the people, please give me the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgold coin that C\u00e6sar had collected for his intended wars. That\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill suffice for the distribution to 300,000 men now. For the rest of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenses I may perhaps borrow from you, if I may be so bold, or from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic treasury on your security, if you will give it, and I will offer my\n\t\t\t\t\t\town property for sale at once.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Octavius was speaking in this fashion Antony was astonished at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom of speech and his boldness, which seemed much beyond the bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropriety and of his years. He was offended by the words because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanting in the respect due to him, and still more by the demand for money,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, accordingly, he replied in the severe terms following: \"Young man, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar left you the government, together with the inheritance and\n\t\t\t\t\t\this name, it is proper for you to ask and for me to give the reasons for my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic acts. But if the Roman people never surrendered the government to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody to dispose of in succession, not even when they had kings, whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpelled and swore never to have any more (this was the very charge that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers brought against your father, saying that they killed him because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was no longer leading but reigning), then there is no need of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswering you as to my public acts. For the same reason I release you from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany indebtedness to me in the way of gratitude for those acts. They were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed not as a favor to you, but to the people, except in one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular, which was of the greatest importance to C\u00e6sar and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourself. For if, to secure my own safety and to shield myself from enmity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI had allowed honors to be voted to the murderers as tyrannicides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar would have been declared a tyrant, to whom neither glory,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor any kind of honor, nor confirmation of his acts would have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible; who could make no valid will, have no son, nor any burial of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody, even as a private citizen. The laws provide that the bodies of tyrants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall be cast out unburied, their memory stigmatized, and their property\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfiscated. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Apprehending all of these consequences, I entered the lists for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, for his immortal honor, and his public funeral, not without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger, not without incurring hatred to myself, contending against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thot-headed, blood-thirsty men, who, as you know, had already conspired to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkill me; and against the Senate, which was displeased with your father on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of his usurped authority. But I willingly chose to incur these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdangers and to suffer anything rather than allow C\u00e6sar to remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunburied and dishonored -- the most valiant man of his time, the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortunate in every respect, and the one to whom the highest honors were due\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom me.

If any were brought before other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates, Octavius was worsted through Antony's influence, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed by the public records that the purchases had been made by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfather, and that the last\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecree of the Senate had confirmed all of C\u00e6sar's acts. Great\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrongs were done him in these judgments, and the losses in consequence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthereof were going on without end, until Pedius and Pinarius, who had a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain portion of the inheritance under C\u00e6sar's will, complained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Antony, both for themselves and for Octavius, that they were suffering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinjustice in violation of the Senate's decree. They thought that he ought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannul only the things done in derogation of C\u00e6sar, and to ratify\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall that had been done by him. Antony acknowledged that his course was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperhaps somewhat contrary to the agreements voted. The decrees also, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, had been recorded in a sense different from the understanding at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. While hastily passing a mere decree of amnesty, it had been registered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat whatever had been previously determined on should stand unrepealed, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor its own sake, not because it was satisfactory in all respects, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather to promote good order and to quiet the people, who had been thrown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto tumult by these events. It would be more just, he added, to observe the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit than the letter of the decree, and not to make an unseemly opposition\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto so many men who had lost their own and their ancestors' property in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcivil convulsions, and to do this in favor of a young man who had received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan amount of other people's wealth disproportionate to a private station and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeyond his hopes, and who was not making good use of his fortune, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\temploying it in the rashest adventures. He would take care of them (Pedius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pinarius) after their portion should have been separated from that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. This was the answer made by Antony to Pedius and Pinarius. So they\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook their portion immediately, in order not to lose their own share by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlawsuits, and they did this not so much on their own account as on that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, for they were going to bestow the whole of it upon him soon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafterward. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The games were now approaching, which Gaius Antonius, the brother of Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas about to give in behalf of Brutus, the pr\u00e6tor, as he attended\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso to the other duties of the pr\u00e6torship which devolved on him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the latter's absence. Lavish expense was incurred in the preparations for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, in the hope that the people, gratified by the spectacle, would recall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius. Octavius, on the other hand, intrigued against this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscheme, distributing the money derived from the sale of his property among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head men of the tribes by turns, to be divided by them among the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomers. He went around to the places where his property was on sale and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered the auctioneers to announce the lowest possible price for\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything, both on account of the uncertainty and danger of the lawsuits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill pending, and on account of his own zeal for the people, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of which brought him both popularity and sympathy as one undeserving of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch treatment. When, in addition to what he had received as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's heir, he offered for sale his own property derived from\n\t\t\t\t\t\this father Octavius, and whatever he had from other sources, and all that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelonged to his mother and to Philippus, and the shares of Pedius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPinarius which he begged from them, in order to make the distribution to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople (because in consequence of the litigation C\u00e6sar's property\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not sufficient even for this purpose), then the people considered it no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger the gift of the elder C\u00e6sar, but of the younger one, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey commiserated him deeply and praised him both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor what he endured and for what he aspired to be. It was evident that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not long tolerate the wrong that Antony was doing him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t They showed their feelings clearly while Brutus' games were in progress,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlavish as these were. Although a certain number, who had been hired for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose, shouted that Brutus and Cassius should be recalled, and the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe spectators were thus wrought up to a feeling of pity for them, crowds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tran in and stopped the games until the demand for their recall ceased. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius learned that Octavius had frustrated what they had hoped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto obtain from the games, they decided to go to Syria and Macedonia, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been theirs before these provinces were voted to Dolabella and Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to seize them by force. When their intentions became known, Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastened to Syria, taking the province of Asia in his way in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect money there. Antony, thinking that he should soon need troops for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own purposes, conceived the idea of transferring to himself the army in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia, which was composed of the very best material and was of large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize (it consisted of six legions, besides a great number of archers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlight-armed troops, much cavalry, and a corresponding amount of apparatus of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall kinds), although it properly belonged to Dolabella, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrusted with Syria and the war against the Parthians, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was about to use these forces against the Parthians. Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanted it especially because it was close at hand, and, by crossing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic, could be thrown at once into Italy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Presently a rumor was noised about that the Get\u00e6, learning of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's death, had made an incursion into Macedonia and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\travaging it. Antony asked the Senate to give him an army in order to punish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, saying that this army had been prepared by C\u00e6sar to be used\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the Get\u00e6 before marching against the Parthians, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything was now quiet on the Parthian frontier. The Senate distrusted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trumor, and sent messengers to make inquiry. Antony, in order to dissipate\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir fear and suspicion, proposed a decree that it should not be lawful for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody, for any cause whatever, to vote for a dictatorship, or to accept it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif offered. If anybody should disregard any of these provisions, he might be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled with impunity by anybody who should meet him. Having deceived the Senate chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby this means, and having agreed with the friends of Dolabella to give him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone legion, he was chosen absolute commander of the forces in Macedonia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving obtained what he desired, he sent his brother Gaius with haste to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunicate the decree of the Senate to the army. Those who had been sent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinquire into the rumor came back and reported that they had seen no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet\u00e6 in Macedonia, but they added, either truthfully, or because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were instructed to do so by Antony, that it was feared that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake an incursion into Macedonia if the army were withdrawn. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While these things were taking place at Rome, Cassius and Brutus were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollecting troops and money, and Trebonius, who was governor of the province\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Asia, was fortifying his towns for them. When Dolabella arrived,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrebonius would not admit him to Pergamus or Smyrna, but allowed him, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul, to occupy a market-place outside the walls. When the latter attacked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls with fury, but accomplished nothing, Trebonius said that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe admitted to Ephesus. Dolabella started for Ephesus forthwith, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrebonius sent a force to follow him at a certain distance. While these were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserving Dolabella's march, they were overtaken by night, and, having no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfarther suspicions, returned to Smyrna, leaving a few of their number to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollow him. Dolabella laid an ambush for this small number, captured and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled them, and went back the same night to Smyrna. Finding it unguarded,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the took it by escalade. Trebonius, who was captured in bed, told his captors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lead the way to Dolabella, saying that he was willing to follow them. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the centurions answered him facetiously, \"Go where you please, but you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust leave your head behind, for we are ordered to bring your head, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourself.\" With these words the centurion immediately cut off his head, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly in the morning Dolabella ordered it to be displayed on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tor's chair where Trebonius was accustomed to transact public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness. Since Trebonius had participated in the murder of C\u00e6sar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby detaining Antony in conversation at the door of the senate-house while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe others killed him, the soldiers and camp-followers fell upon the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this body with fury and treated it with every kind of indignity. They rolled\n\t\t\t\t\t\this head from one to another in sport along the city pavements like a ball\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttill it was completely crushed. This was the first of the murderers who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisited with such punishment. \n\t\t\t\t"},"3":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony conceived the idea of bringing his army from Macedonia to Italy; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in want of any other pretext for this step he asked the Senate to let\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim exchange the province of Macedonia for that of Cisalpine Gaul, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder the command of Decimus Brutus Albinus. He remembered that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had marched from the latter province when he overthrew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey and he thought that he should appear to be transferring his army to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul and not to Italy. The Senate, which looked upon Cisalpine Gaul as its\n\t\t\t\t\t\town fortress, was angry, and now for the first time perceived the stratagem\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand repented having given him Macedonia. The principal members sent word\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivately to Decimus to keep a strong hold on his province, and to raise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional troops and money lest he should be overpowered by Antony, so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid they fear and hate the latter. Antony then bethought him to ask the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, instead of the Senate, for this province by a law, in the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner that C\u00e6sar had obtained it at a former time and Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad recently obtained Syria. In order to intimidate the Senate he ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\this brother, Gaius, to bring his army across the Adriatic to Brundusium; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter proceeded to do as he was directed. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This was the time for the games that the \u00e6dile Critonius was about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto exhibit, and Octavius made preparations to display his father's gilded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrone and crown, which the Senate had voted should be placed in front for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim at all games. When Critonius said that he could not allow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar to be honored in this way at games given at his expense,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius brought him before Antony as consul. Antony said he would refer the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter to the Senate. Octavius was vexed and said, \"Refer it; I will place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe throne there as long as the decree is in force.\" Antony was angry and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprohibited it. He prohibited it still more unreasonably in the next games\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven by Octavius himself, which had been instituted by his father in honor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Venus Genetrix when he dedicated a temple to her in a forum, together\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the forum itself. It was evident that universal hatred of Antony had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready grown out of this affair, since he seemed to be moved not so much by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta feeling of rivalry toward the younger C\u00e6sar as by an ungrateful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose to insult the memory of the elder one. Octavius himself, with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowd of people like a body-guard, moved about among the plebeians and those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had received benefits from his father, or had served under him in war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstirring their anger and beseeching them not to despise him, the victim of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso many and so great outrages, nor willingly desert him, but to defend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, their commander and benefactor, dishonored by Antony; to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefend him for their own sakes, because they would never be secure in what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had received from C\u00e6sar unless the decrees passed in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonor should remain in full force. He exclaimed against Antony everywhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthroughout the city, and especially from the high places that he came to,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying, \" O Antony, do not be angry with C\u00e6sar on my account. Do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot insult one who has been the greatest benefactor to you. Heap indignities\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton me to your heart's content. Cease plundering his property until the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegacy to the citizens is paid; then take all the rest. However poor I may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe, my father's glory, if that remains, and the distribution to the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you will allow it to be made, will be all-sufficient for me.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Henceforth there were open and repeated outcries against Antony on all sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter indulged in severer threats against Octavius, and when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame known the people were still more incensed against him. The tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Antony's guard, who had served under the elder C\u00e6sar, and who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere then in the highest favor with Antony, urged him to refrain from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsult, both on their account and on his own, as he had served under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and had obtained his present good fortune at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's hands. Antony, recognizing the truth of these words, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeeling a sense of shame before those who uttered them and needing some help\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Octavius himself, with the people, to procure the exchange of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, agreed with what they said and swore that what he had done had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen quite contrary to his intention, but that he had been compelled to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange his purpose because the young man was inordinately puffed up, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill a youth and showing no respect for his elders and no honor for those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin authority. Although for his own benefit the young man still needed\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproof, yet in deference to their remonstrances he would restrain his anger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand return to his former disposition and intention if Octavius, also, would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurb his presumption. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The tribunes were delighted with this reply and they brought Antony and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius together, who, after some mutual chiding, formed an alliance. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw concerning Cisalpine Gaul was proposed at once to the great dismay of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe senators. They intended, if Antony should first bring the law before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, to reject it, and if he should bring it before the popular assembly\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout consulting them, to have the tribunes of the people veto it. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere some who advised that this province be made free altogether, so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas it dreaded on account of its nearness. Antony, on the other hand,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccused them of intrusting it to Decimus because he had been one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's murderers and of having no confidence in himself because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had not joined in killing the man who had subdued the province and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought it to its knees -- throwing out these insinuations openly against all of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this opponents, as persons who rejoiced over the assassination. When the day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the comitia came the Senate desired that the votes should be taken by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturies, but the Antonians, who had enclosed the forum with a rope during\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe night, demanded that the votes be taken by tribes according to a plan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had agreed upon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the plebeians were incensed against Antony they nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated with him for the sake of Octavius, who stood alongside\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rope and begged them to do so. He did this in order that Decimus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been one of his father's murderers, might not have the government of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince so convenient, and of the army belonging to it, and, moreover, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgratify Antony, who was now in league with him. He expected also to get some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance from Antony in return. The tribunes had been corrupted with money\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Antony and remained silent. So the law was passed and Antony now with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplausible reason brought his army across the Adriatic. \n\t\t\t\t"},"4":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t One of the tribunes of the people having died Octavius favored the election\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Flaminius as his successor. The people thought that he was ambitious of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis office for himself, but that he refrained from being a candidate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he was under age, and, accordingly, they proposed to cast their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvotes for him for tribune. The Senate begrudged him this increase of power,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearing lest, as tribune, he should bring the murderers of his father before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe popular assembly for trial. Antony, in disregard of his recent alliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Octavius, either to curry favor with the Senate, or to appease its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissatisfaction with the law respecting Cisalpine Gaul, or for private\n\t\t\t\t\t\treasons, gave public notice, as consul, that Octavius should not solicit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvotes contrary to law; and that if he should do so he (Antony) would use\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery means in his power against him. As this edict was an act of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingratitude toward Octavius, and was insulting both to him and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, the latter were extremely angry and took steps to defeat Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\twishes in the election, so that he became alarmed and annulled the comitia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying that the remaining number of tribunes was sufficient. Octavius, thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat last openly attacked, sent numerous agents to the towns colonized by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather to tell how he had been treated and to learn the state of feeling in\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach. He also sent certain persons in the guise of traders into Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp to mingle with the soldiers, to work upon the boldest of them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly distribute handbills among the rank and file. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Octavius was doing this the military tribunes again sought an audience\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Antony and addressed him thus: We, O Antony, and the others who served\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith you under C\u00e6sar, established his rule and continued to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaintain it from day to day as its faithful supporters. We know how his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers hate and conspire against us and how the Senate favors them. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the people drove them out we took fresh courage seeing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's acts were not altogether without friends, were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforgotten, were not unappreciated. For our future security we put our trust\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin you, the friend of C\u00e6sar, after him the most experienced of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a commander, our present leader, and the one most fit to be such. Our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies are starting up afresh. They have boldly seized Syria and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia and are raising\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney and troops against us. The Senate is stirring up Decimus Brutus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst you. Yet you are wasting your powers of mind in a disagreement with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe young C\u00e6sar. We naturally fear lest there be added to the war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich has not yet broken out but is imminent, dissensions among you, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall accomplish all that our enemies desire against us. We beseech you to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider these things for the sake of piety toward C\u00e6sar and care\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor us, who have never given you cause for complaint, and for your own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest even more than ours. Help Octavius as much as you can, or at all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents as much as may be needful, to punish the murderers. Then you will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoy your power without anxiety and will provide security for us, who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow apprehensive both for ourselves and for you.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t To the tribunes who had thus spoken Antony made the following reply: \"What\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendship and zeal I had for C\u00e6sar while he lived, what dangers I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbraved in his service, you, who have been my fellow-soldiers and the sharers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin those events, know full well. What favors he showed me, what honors he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinually bestowed upon me, it does not become me to say. The murderers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo, were acquainted with these facts. They conspired to kill me with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar because they knew that if I were living they could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompass their designs. Whoever dissuaded them from that purpose did so not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom regard for my safety, but to preserve the appearance of tyrannicide, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they might not seem to be killing a number of persons as enemies, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly one as a despot. Who, then, will believe that I have no care for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, who was my benefactor, that I prefer his enemies, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI willingly condone his murder at the hands of those who conspired against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme also, as the young C\u00e6sar imagines? Whence came their amnesty,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhence their preferment? For he wishes to charge these things upon me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of the Senate. Learn from me how they came about. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \" When C\u00e6sar was suddenly slain in the senate-house fear fell upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme most of all by reason of my friendship for him and my ignorance of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacts, as I knew not the particulars of the conspiracy nor against whom it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas designed. The people were terror-stricken. The murderers with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiators took possession of the Capitol and shut themselves up in it. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate was on their side, just as it now is more openly, and was about to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvote rewards to them as tyrannicides. If C\u00e6sar were declared a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrant then might we all have perished as the friends of a tyrant. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmidst of such confusion, anxiety, and fear, when it would not have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurprising if I had been at a loss what to do, you will find, if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\texamine, that where courage was needed I was boldest and where artifice was\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired I was most crafty. The first thing to be done, because it embraced\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything else, was to prevent the voting of rewards to the conspirators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis I accomplished against the strong opposition of the Senate and of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers, with unfailing courage and in the face of danger, because I then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that we of C\u00e6sar's party could be safe only in case\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar were not declared a tyrant. But when I saw our enemies, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate itself, plunged in the same fear (lest, if C\u00e6sar were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot decreed a tyrant, they themselves should be convicted of murder), and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking their fight, for this reason, I yielded and granted amnesty instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof rewards to the murderers, in order to gain what I wanted in exchange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat did I want and how important was it? That C\u00e6sar's name should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be blotted out was the dearest wish of all to me, that his property\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not be confiscated, that the adoption on which this young man prides\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself should not be annulled, that the will should not be declared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvalid, that his body should have a royal funeral, that the immortal honors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously decreed to him should be fulfilled, that all his acts should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed, and that his son, and we his friends, both generals and soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould remain in perfect safety and enjoy a life of honor instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tignominy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \" Think you that I asked few or small things from the Senate in exchange for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amnesty, or that the Senate would have made these concessions without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amnesty? If this exchange had been made in all sincerity it would have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen a fair bargain to actually spare the murderers for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's immortal glory and our complete security, but in fact I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid it not with that intention, but in order to gain time. Accordingly, as soon as I had obtained what I wanted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the Senate, and the murderers were freed from anxiety, I took fresh\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourage and undermined the amnesty, not by votes, not by decrees (for that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas impossible), but by working on the people imperceptibly. I brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's body into the forum under pretence of burial, I laid bare\n\t\t\t\t\t\this wounds, I showed the number of them and his clothing all bloody and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslashed by the knives. In public speech I dwelt on his bravery and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices to the common people in pathetic terms, weeping for him as slain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand invoking him as a god. These acts and words of mine stirred up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, kindled a fire in spite of the amnesty, sent them against the houses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof our enemies, and drove the murderers from the city. How much the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas thwarted and grieved by this was presently shown when they blamed me for\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting the people and sent the murderers away to take command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, Brutus and Cassius to Syria and Macedonia, which were provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith great armies, telling them to hasten before the appointed time, under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretence of looking after the corn supply. And now another and still greater fear took possession of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme (as I had no military force of my own anywhere), lest we should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed without arms to the assaults of so many armed men. I suspected my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague also because he was always at variance with me. He had pretended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be in the conspiracy against C\u00e6sar and he had proposed that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday of the murder should be celebrated as the birthday of the republic. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \" While I was at a loss what to do, desiring to disarm our enemies and to arm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tourselves instead, I put Amatius to death and recalled Sextus Pompeius in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to entrap the Senate again and bring it over to my side. But as even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen I had no confidence in it I persuaded Dolabella to ask for the province\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Syria, not from the Senate, but from the people by a law, and I favored\n\t\t\t\t\t\this petition so that he should become an enemy instead of a friend of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers, and so that the senators should be ashamed to refuse me Macedonia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafterwards. Still, the Senate would not have assigned Macedonia to me, even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter Dolabella had been provided for, by reason of the army belonging to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, if I had not previously transferred the army to Dolabella, as the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the Parthians fell to the lot of the one governing Syria. But they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not have taken Macedonia and Syria away from Brutus and Cassius unless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother provinces had been obtained for them to ensure their safety. When it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame necessary to make them a recompense, look at the quid pro\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquo that was given to them -- Cyrene and Crete, devoid of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops, provinces which even our enemies despise as not sufficient for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety; and they are now trying to seize by force those that were taken from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Thus in fact was the army transferred from our enemies to Dolabella by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tartifice, by stratagem, by exchange; for when there was no way to gain our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend openly by arms we had necessarily to have recourse to the laws. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"After these events our enemies had raised another army and it became needful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor me to have the one in Macedonia; but I was in want of a pretext. A rumor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgained currency that the Get\u00e6 were ravaging Macedonia. This was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisbelieved, and while messengers were sent to make inquiry I brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward the decree about the dictatorship, providing that it should not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlawful to speak of it, to vote for it, or to accept it if offered. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators were particularly taken with this proposal and they gave me the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy. Then for the first time I considered myself on an equality with my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, not merely with the open ones [as Octavius thinks], but with the more numerous and powerful ones who still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoose to remain secret. When I had accomplished these plans there remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the murderers on my flank, Decimus Brutus, who governed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconveniently placed province with a large army, whom I, knowing him to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbolder than the rest, have deprived of Cisalpine Gaul, by promising, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to keep up appearances with the Senate, to give him in exchange\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia, when it has lost its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy. The Senate was indignant, for it now perceived the stratagem, and you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow what kind of letters, and how many, they are writing to Decimus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow they are inciting my successors in the consulship. I decided to take a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbolder course and ask the people for this province by a law, instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasking the Senate, and I brought my army from Macedonia to Brundusium so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I might use it in emergencies. And, with the help of the gods, we will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse it as may be needful. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Thus have we changed from the great fear that formerly beset us to a state\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof entire safety for ourselves, where we can boldly face our foes. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese facts became known the multitude showed their zeal against our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. You see how the latter regret the decrees that have been passed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat a fight they are making to deprive me of the Gallic province which has\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready been given to me.

Nevertheless they urged him to come to an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement with Octavius; and as both yielded they formed a new alliance in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Capitol. Not long afterward Antony announced to his friends that some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this body-guard had been tampered with by Octavius, who had formed a plot\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him. This he said either as a slander, or because he believed it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe true, or because he had heard of the emissaries of Octavius in his camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand thought they were actually plotting against his life. When this story\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas noised about there was a general tumult forthwith and great indignation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor there were few who had sufficient penetration to see that it was for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest of Octavius that Antony, even though he were unjust to him, should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive, because he (Antony) was a terror to the murderers. If he were dead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would quite fearlessly dare anything, especially as they had the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport of the Senate. The more intelligent knew this, but the greater part,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeing what Octavius suffered daily from the indignities and the losses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflicted on him, considered the accusation not incredible, yet held it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe impious and intolerable that a conspiracy should be formed against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's life while he was consul. Octavius ran with mad fury to those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld this opinion of him, exclaiming that it was Antony that had conspired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him to alienate from him the friendship of the people, which was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly thing left to him. He ran to Antony's door and repeated the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings, calling the gods to witness, taking all kinds of oaths, and inviting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony to a judicial investigation. As nobody came forward he said, \"I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccept your friends as judges.\" With these words he attempted to enter the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouse. Being prevented from doing so he again cried out and railed at Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand vented his wrath against the doorkeepers who restrained him from having\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta dispute with Antony. Then he went away and called the people to witness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat if anything should happen to him his death would be due to Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplots. As these words were spoken with deep feeling the multitude underwent\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta change, and a kind of penitence took the place of their former opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were some who still doubted, and hesitated to put faith in either of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Some accused them both of making false pretences, believing that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad come to an agreement in the temple, and that these were plots devised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst their enemies. Still others thought that this was a device of Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto increase his body-guard. or to alienate the veterans from Octavius. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Presently news was brought to Octavius by his secret emissaries that the army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Brundusium and the colonized soldiers were incensed against Antony for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneglecting to avenge the murder of C\u00e6sar, and that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist him (Octavius) to do so if they could. For this reason Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparted to Brundusium. As Octavius feared lest Antony, returning with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, should catch him unprotected he went to Campania with money to enlist\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe veterans who had been colonized in those towns by his father. He first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought over those of Calatia and next those of Casilinum, two towns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated on either side of Capua, giving 500 drachmas to each man. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected about 10,000 men, not fully armed and not mustered in regular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcohorts, but serving merely as a body-guard under one banner The citizens of Rome\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere alarmed at the approach of Antony with an army, and when they learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Octavius was advancing with another one some were doubly alarmed, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers were well pleased, believing that they could make use of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Antony. Still others, who had seen them reconciled to each other in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Capitol, considered these transactions a game of false pretences by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Antony was to have the supreme power and Octavius was to wreak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvengeance on the murderers in return therefor. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this time of consternation Canutius, a tribune of the people and enemy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, and hence friendly to Octavius, went to meet the latter. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned his intentions Canutius addressed the people, saying that Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas advancing with real hostility to Antony and that those who were afraid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Antony was aiming at tyranny should side with Octavius as they had no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother army at present. After speaking thus he brought in Octavius, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped before the city at the temple of Mars, fifteen stades distant. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter arrived he proceeded to the temple of Castor and Pollux, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\this soldiers surrounded carrying concealed daggers. Canutius addressed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople first, speaking against Antony. Octavius also reminded them of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather and of what he had himself suffered at the hands of Antony, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of which he had enlisted this army as a guard for himself. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared himself the obedient servant of his country in all things, and said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was ready to confront Antony in the present emergency. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After he had thus spoken and the assembly had been dissolved, the soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking the opposite view (that they had come to support the alliance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and Octavius or as a mere guard for the latter and to punish the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers), were vexed at the declaration of war against Antony, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen their general and was now consul. Some of them asked leave to return\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome in order to arm themselves, saying that they could not perform their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduty with other arms than their own. Others spoke out the truth. As things\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad turned out contrary to his expectation, Octavius was at a loss what to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo. Hoping, however, to retain them by persuasion rather than by force he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyielded to their requests, and sent some of them to get their arms and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers simply to their homes. Concealing his disappointment he praised all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the assembled multitude, gave them new presents, and said that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\treward them still more generously, for he made use of them for emergencies\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather as the friends of his father than as soldiers. After he had spoken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words, from 10,000 he influenced 1000 only to remain with him, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperhaps 3000, for accounts differ as to the number. The rest then took their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparture, but presently they remembered the toils of agriculture and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgains of military service, the words of Octavius, his compliance with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\twishes, and the favors they had received and hoped still to receive from\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. And so, like the fickle multitude, they repented, and seizing upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir former pretext for the sake of appearances, they armed themselves and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent back to him. Octavius had already proceeded with new supplies of money\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Ravenna and the neighboring parts, enlisting new forces continually and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsending them all to Arretium. \n\t\t\t\t"},"6":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime four of the five Macedonian legions had joined Antony at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium. They blamed him because he had not proceeded against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers of C\u00e6sar. They conducted him without applause to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplatform, implying that they required explanations on this subject first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony was angry at their silence. He did not keep his temper, but charged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem with ingratitude in that they had expressed no thanks for being\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferred from the Parthian expedition to Italy. He blamed them because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had not arrested and delivered to him the emissaries of a rash boy (for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso he called Octavius) who had been sent among them to stir up discord. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\the would find them out, he said. He would lead the army to the province\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted to him, the fair Gallic country, and would give 100 drachmas to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman present. They laughed at his parsimony, and when he became angry they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroke out in tumult and went away. Antony rose and departed, saying, \"You\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall learn to obey orders.\" Then he required the military tribunes to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore him the fomenters of the sedition (for it is customary in Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies to keep at all times a record of the character of each man). From\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese he chose by lot a certain number according to military law, and he put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto death not every tenth man, but a smaller number, thinking to strike\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterror into the rest by means of the few.

Antony tried to find these emissaries\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby means of rewards to informers and threats against those who abetted them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut as he caught no one he became angry, believing that the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed them. When the news came of what Octavius was doing among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonized veterans and at Rome, he became alarmed, and going before the army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain he said that he was sorry for what he had been compelled by military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscipline to do to a few instead of the much larger number who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishable by law, and that they must know very well that Antony was neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcruel nor stingy.

The 100 drachmas which I have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered to be given you is not my donative, for that would be unworthy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fortune of Antony, but rather the salutation of our first meeting than a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfull reward, but it is necessary to obey the laws of our country, and of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, in this affair as in all others.\" When he had thus spoken he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not as yet add anything to the donative, that it might not seem that as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral he had yielded anything to the army. Whether moved by penitence or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby fear they took what was given them. Antony, being still angry at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutbreak, or from some other suspicion, changed their tribunes. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder he treated well because he had need of their services, and he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem forward by detachments along the sea-coast toward Ariminum. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony chose from the whole number a pr\u00e6torian cohort of the men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were best in body and character and marched to Rome, intending to push\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton thence toward Ariminum. He entered the city in a haughty manner leaving\n\t\t\t\t\t\this squadron of horse encamped outside the walls. But the troops that\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccompanied him were girded as for war, and they mounted guard over his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouse at night under arms, and he gave them a countersign and relieved them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregularly, just as in a camp. He convoked the Senate in order to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplaint of the acts of Octavius, and just as he was entering it he learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the so-called Martian legion, one of the four on the road, had gone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover to Octavius. While he was waiting at the entrance cogitating over this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnews it was announced to him that another legion, called the Fourth, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed the example of the Martian and espoused the side of Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDisconcerted as he was he entered the senate-house, pretending that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvened them about other matters, said a few words, and immediately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparted to the city gates, and thence to the town of Alba, in order to persuade the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserters to come back to him. They shot arrows at him from the walls, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the retreated. To the other legions he forwarded 500 drachmas per man. With\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers he had with him he marched to Tibur, taking the apparatus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary to those who are going to war; for war was now certain, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus Brutus had refused to give up Cisalpine Gaul. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Antony was at Tibur nearly all the Senate, and the greater part of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights, and the most influential plebeians, came there to do him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thonor. These persons, arriving while he was swearing into\n\t\t\t\t\t\this service the soldiers present and also the discharged veterans who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflocked in (of whom there was a goodly number), voluntarily joined in taking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oath that they would not fail in friendship and fidelity to Antony; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one would have been at a loss to know who were the men who, a little\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, had decried Antony at Octavius' public meeting. With this brilliant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsend-off Antony started for Ariminum, which lies on the border of Cisalpine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul. His army, exclusive of the new levies, consisted of three legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummoned from Macedonia (for the remainder had now arrived). There were also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome discharged veterans, old men, who appeared nevertheless to be worth\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwice as much as the new levies. Thus Antony had four legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-disciplined troops, and the helpers who usually accompanied them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesides his body-guard and the new levies. Lepidus in Spain with four\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, Asinius Pollio with two, and Plancus in Transalpine Gaul with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree, seemed likely to espouse the side of Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius had two legions equally efficient, which had deserted from Antony to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, also one legion of new levies and two of discharged veterans, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplete in numbers or in arms, but filled up with new recruits. He brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem all to Alba and there communicated with the Senate, which congratulated\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in such a way that now one would have been at a loss to know who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who had lately ranged themselves with Antony; but it regretted that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe legions had not come over to the Senate itself instead of to him. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraised them and Octavius nevertheless, and said that it would vote them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhatever was needful as soon as the new magistrates should enter upon their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduties. It was plain that the Senate would use these forces against Antony;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut having no army of its own anywhere, and being unable to levy one without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, it adjourned all business until the new consuls should come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers of Octavius furnished him lictors provided with fasces and urged\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to assume the title of propr\u00e6tor, carrying on war and leading\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, since they were always marshalled under magistrates. He thanked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem for the honor, but referred the matter to the Senate. When they wanted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto go before the Senate en masse he prevented them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not even allow them to send messengers, believing that the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould vote these things to him voluntarily; \"and would do this all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore,\" he said, \"if they know of your zeal and my hesitation.\" They were\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciled to this course with difficulty. The leading officers complained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he disdained them, and he explained to them that the Senate was moved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot so much by good-will toward him as by fear of Antony and the want of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy; \"and that will be the case,\" he continued, \"until we humble Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand until the murderers, who are friends and relatives of the senators,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect a military force for them. Knowing these facts I falsely pretend to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe serving them. Let us not be the first to expose this false pretence. If\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe usurp the office they will accuse us of arrogance and violence, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif we are modest they will probably give it of their own accord, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlest I accept it from you.\" After he had thus spoken he witnessed some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary exercises of the two legions that had deserted from Antony, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tranged themselves opposite each other and gave a complete representation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta battle, except only the killing. Octavius was delighted with the spectacle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was pleased to make this a pretext for distributing 500 drachmas more to\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach man, and he promised that in case of war he would give them 5000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrachmas each if they were victorious. Thus, by means of lavish gifts, did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius bind these mercenaries to himself. Such was the course of events in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly. \n\t\t\t\t"},"7":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Cisalpine Gaul Antony ordered Decimus Brutus to withdraw to Macedonia in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobedience to the decree of the Roman people, and for his own good. Decimus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin reply, sent him the letters that had been furnished him by the Senate, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch as to say that he cared no more for the command of the people than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony did for that of the Senate. Antony then fixed a day for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompliance, after which he should treat him as an enemy. Decimus advised him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fix a later day lest he (Antony) should too soon make himself an enemy to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate. Although Antony could have easily overcome him, as he was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the open country, he decided to proceed first against the cities. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\topened their gates to him. Decimus, fearing lest none of them should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\topened to him, fabricated letters from the Senate calling him to Rome with\n\t\t\t\t\t\this army and retired towards Italy, welcomed by all as he passed along,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil he arrived at the wealthy city of Mutina. Here he closed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgates and possessed himself of the property of the inhabitants for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport of his army. He slaughtered and salted all the cattle he could find\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere in anticipation of a long siege, and he awaited Antony. His army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsisted of a large number of gladiators and three legions of infantry, one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof which was composed of new recruits as yet inexperienced. The other two\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad served under him before and were entirely trustworthy. Antony advanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him with fury, drew a line of circumvallation around Mutina, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid siege to Decimus. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Rome, at the beginning of the new year, the consuls, Hirtius and Pansa,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvened the Senate on the subject of Antony immediately after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifices had been performed and in the very temple.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero and his friends urged that Antony be now declared a public enemy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince he had seized Cisalpine Gaul with an armed force against the will of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate and made of it a point of attack on the republic, and had brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto Italy an army given to him to operate against the Thracians. They spoke\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso of his seeking the supreme power as C\u00e6sar's successor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he publicly surrounded himself in the city with such a large body of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmed centurions, and converted his house into a fortress with arms and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountersigns, and had borne himself more haughtily in other respects than\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas befitting a yearly magistrate. Lucius Piso, who had charge of Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests in his absence, a man among the most illustrious in Rome, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers who sided with him on his own account, or on Antony's, or because of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own opinion, contended that Antony ought to have a trial, that it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot the custom of their ancestors to condemn a man unheard, that it was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecent to declare a man an enemy to-day who was a consul yesterday, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially one whom Cicero himself as well as the rest had so often lavishly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraised. The Senate, which was about equally divided in opinion, remained in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsession till night. Early the next morning it reassembled to consider the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame question and then the party of Cicero was in the majority and Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have been voted a public enemy had not the tribune Salvius adjourned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sitting to the following day; for among the magistrates the one who has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe veto power always prevails. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ciceronians heaped gross reproaches and insults on Salvius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, and sallied out among the plebeians to excite them against him and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummoned him to answer before them. He set forth to obey the summons\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundismayed until he was restrained by the Senate, which feared lest he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould change the people around by recalling Antony to their memory; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators well knew that they were condemning an illustrious man without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial, and that the people had given him this very Gallic province. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince they feared for the safety of the murderers they were angry with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony because he had made the first movement against them after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamnesty, for which reason the Senate had previously needed the help of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius against him. Although Octavius knew this he desired nevertheless to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the lead in humbling Antony. Such were the reasons why the Senate was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tangry with Antony. Although the vote on him was adjourned by the command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tribune, they passed a decree praising Decimus for not abandoning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine Gaul to Antony, and directing Octavius to assist the consuls,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHirtius and Pansa, with the army he now had. They awarded him a gilded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatue and the right to declare his opinion among the consulars in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate even now, and the right to stand for the consulship itself ten years\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the legal period, and voted from the public treasury to the legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat deserted from Antony to him the same amount that he had promised to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive them if they should be victorious. After passing these decrees they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjourned, thinking that Antony would in fact know from the votes taken that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was declared a public enemy and believing, also, that on the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday the tribune would no longer interpose his veto. The mother, the wife,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the son of Antony (who was still a young man), and his other relatives\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand friends went around the whole night visiting the houses of influential\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen and beseeching them. In the morning they put themselves in the way of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose going to the senate-house, fell at their feet with wailing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamentation and in mourning garments, crying out alongside the doors. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the senators were moved by these cries, this spectacle, this so sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange of fortune. Cicero, fearing the result, addressed the Senate as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows: -- \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"What decision ought to be reached concerning Antony we determined yesterday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen we bestowed honors on his enemies we thereby voted him an enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvius, who alone interrupted the proceedings, must either have been wiser\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan all the rest, or moved to do so by private friendship, or by ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof present circumstances. It would be most disgraceful to us, on the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, if all should seem to know less than one, and to Salvius, on the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, if he should prefer private friendship to the public weal. If he is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot well acquainted with the present circumstances he ought to repose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence in the consuls, rather than in himself, in the pr\u00e6tors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his fellow-tribunes, and the other senators, so imposing in dignity and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin numbers, so much his superiors in age and experience, who have condemned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. In our elections and in our jury trials justice is ever on the side\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the majority. If it be needful still to acquaint him with the reasons for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour action I will briefly recount the principal ones by way of reminder. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's death Antony possessed himself of our money. Having been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested with the government of Macedonia by us he seized upon that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine Gaul without our authority. Having received an army to operate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the Thracians he brought it into Italy against us instead. Each of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese powers with his own secret motives he asked from us, and when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere refused he acted on his own authority. At Brundusium he organized a\n\t\t\t\t\t\troyal cohort for his own use and openly made men-at-arms his private guards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand night watchmen, serving under a countersign. The whole remainder of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy he led from Brundusium to the city, aiming by a shorter path at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame designs that C\u00e6sar contemplated. Being anticipated by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyounger C\u00e6sar and his army he became alarmed and turned his course\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Gallic province as a convenient point of attack on us, just as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar found it when he made himself our master. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"In order to intimidate the soldiers to do every unlawful act he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder, he decimated them although they had not revolted and had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoned their watch or their ranks in time of war, for which offences\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone military law allows such cruel punishment, which only a few generals\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave visited upon their soldiers and with reluctance, in cases of extreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperil, as a matter of necessity. These citizens Antony put to death for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tword or a laugh when they had not been regularly condemned but chosen by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlot. For this reason those who could do so revolted from him, and you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyesterday voted them a donative as well-doers. Those who could not desert\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined him in wrong-doing under the influence of fear, marched against our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince as enemies, and besieged our army and our general, to whom you sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tletters directing him to hold the province. Antony now orders him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevacuate it. Are we voting Antony an enemy, or is he already making war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst us? And these things our tribune is still ignorant of, and will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain so until Decimus is overthrown and this great province on our border,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with the army of Decimus, is added to the resources with which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony hopes to attack us. I suppose that the tribune will vote Antony an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy as soon as the latter becomes more powerful than we are.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Scarcely had Cicero finished speaking when his friends broke forth in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttumultuous applause that for a long time nobody could be heard on the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside, until finally Piso came forward, when the senators, out of respect for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, became silent and even the Ciceronians restrained themselves. Then Piso\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid: \" Our law, Conscript Fathers, requires that the accused shall himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\thear the charge preferred against him and shall be judged after he has made\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own defence; and for the truth of this I appeal to Cicero, our greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\torator. Since he hesitates to accuse Antony when present, but brings against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in his absence certain charges which he considers of the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgravity, and not open to doubt, I have come forward to show, in the fewest\n\t\t\t\t\t\twords, that these charges are false. He says that Antony converted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic money to his own use after C\u00e6sar's death. The law declares\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a person to be a thief, not a public enemy, and limits his punishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordingly. After Brutus had killed C\u00e6sar he accused the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the people of plundering the public money and leaving the treasury\n\t\t\t\t\t\tempty. Soon afterward Antony proposed a decree to investigate these matters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand you adopted and confirmed his motion and promised a reward of one-tenth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto informers, which reward we will double if anybody will prove that Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad any part in the fraud. So much for the charge in reference to money. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"We did not vote the governorship of Cisalpine Gaul to Antony. The people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave it to him by a law, Cicero being present; just as other provinces had\n\t\t\t\t\t\toften been given, and as this same governorship had previously been given to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. It was a part of this law that, when Antony should arrive\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the province given to him, if Decimus would not yield it Antony should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclare war and lead the army into the Gallic province against him, instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof using it against the Thracians, who were still quiet. But Cicero does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider Decimus, who is bearing arms against the law, an enemy, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiders Antony an enemy who is fighting in accordance with law. He who\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccuses the law itself accuses the authors of the law, whom he ought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange by persuasion, not to insult after having himself agreed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. He ought not to intrust the province to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus, whom the people drove out of the city on account of the murder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile refusing to intrust to Antony what the people gave to him. It is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part of good counsellors to be at variance with the people, especially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin times of danger, or to forget that this very power of deciding who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends and who are enemies formerly belonged to the people. According to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ancient laws the people are the sole arbiters of peace and war. Heaven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrant that they may not be reminded of this, and consequently be angry with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus when they have found a leader. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"But it is said that Antony put certain soldiers to death. Being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommander-in-chief he was empowered to do so by you. No commander has ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendered an account of such matters.

Hatred has betrayed Cicero into inconsistency, for he accused\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony of aiming at supreme power and yet punishing his soldiers, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch conspirators are always lenient, not severe, toward the men serving\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder them. As Cicero does not hesitate to arraign as tyrannical all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of Antony's administration since C\u00e6sar's death, come, let me\n\t\t\t\t\t\texamine his acts one by one. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Whom has Antony put to death in a tyrannical manner without trial--he who is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow in danger of being condemned unheard? Whom has he banished from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity? Whom has he slandered in our presence? Or, if innocent toward us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividually, has he conspired against all of us collectively? When, O\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero? Was it when he carried through the Senate the act of amnesty for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast? Was it when he abstained from prosecuting anybody for the murder? Was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit when he moved an investigation of the public moneys? Was it when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the recall of Sextus Pompey, the son of your Pompey, and payment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor his father's confiscated property out of the public treasury? Was it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he seized that conspirator, the false Marius, and put him to death, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou all applauded? And because you did so it was the only act of Antony that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero did not calumniate. Was it when he brought in a decree that nobody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould ever propose a dictatorship, or vote for it, and that anybody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisobeying the decree might be killed with impunity by any one who wished?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese are the public acts that Antony performed for us during two months the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly months that he remained in the city after C\u00e6sar's death, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery time when the people were pursuing the murderers and you were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehensive of the future. If he were a villain what better opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould he have had? But it is said that he was not in a condition to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\totherwise. How? Did he not exercise the sole authority after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella departed for Syria? Did he not have an armed force in readiness in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city, one that you gave him ? Did he not patrol the city by night ? Was\n\t\t\t\t\t\the not guarded at night against any conspiracy of his enemies? Did he not\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave an excuse for this in the murder of C\u00e6sar, his friend and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefactor, the man most beloved by the common people ? Did he not have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother of a personal kind in the fact that the murderers conspired against\n\t\t\t\t\t\this life also? None of them did he kill or banish, but pardoned them what he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould in decency, and did not begrudge them the governorships that were\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffered to them. Ye behold then, O Romans, these very grave and indisputable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharges of Cicero against Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \" Since, in addition to charges, surmises are introduced to the effect that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony was about to lead an army to the city, but became alarmed because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius had anticipated him with another army, how does it happen that when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mere intention to do this makes a man an enemy the one who actually\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomes and encamps alongside of us without authority is not considered an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy? What would have prevented Antony from coming if he had wanted to?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith 30,000 troops in line was he afraid of Octavius' 3000, half-armed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunorganized, who had come together merely to gain his friendship, and who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft him as soon as they knew that he had chosen them for war? If Antony was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafraid to come with 30,000 how did he dare to come with only 1000? With\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese what a crowd of us accompanied him to Tibur! What a crowd of us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily joined the soldiers in taking the oath of fidelity to him! What\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraises did Cicero lavish on his acts and virtues! If Antony himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontemplated any such thing [as invasion] why did he leave as pledges in our\n\t\t\t\t\t\thands his mother, his wife, and his grown up son, who are even now at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoor of the Senate weeping and fearful, not on account of what Antony has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone, but on account of the overwhelming power of his enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"These facts furnish you an example of Antony's defence and of Cicero's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfickleness. I will add an exhortation to right-minded men, not to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinjustice to the people or to Antony, not to expose the public interests to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew enmities and dangers while the commonwealth is sick and in want of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimely defenders, but to establish a sufficient force in the city to ward\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff danger before breeding disorder outside, to provide against attacks from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery quarter, and to come to such decisions as you please when you are able\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto carry them into effect. How shall these ends be accomplished? By allowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, as a matter of policy, or for the sake of the people, to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine Gaul. Call Decimus thence with his three legions, and when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomes send him to Macedonia, retaining his legions here. If the two legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat deserted from Antony deserted to us, as Cicero says, let us summon them\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso from Octavius to the city. Thus with five legions sustaining us we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight pass such decrees as we think best with entire confidence, depending\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the favor of no man. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \" I have addressed these words to men who listen to me without malice or the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit of contention. Those who would excite you heedlessly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinconsiderately on account of private enmity and private strife I exhort not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto come to hasty and rash decisions against the most important personages,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho command strong armies, and not to force them into war against their\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill. Remember Marcius Coriolanus. Recall the recent doings of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, whom we rashly voted an enemy while he was in like manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleading an army and offering us the fairest terms of peace, whereby we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforced him to be an enemy in fact. Have regard for the people who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlately pursuing C\u00e6sar's murderers, lest we seem to insult them by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving those murderers the governorship of provinces, by praising Decimus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor nullifying the people's law, and by voting Antony an enemy because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccepted the Gallic province from the people. For which reasons the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-wishers of the country ought to take thought for the erring, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls and tribunes ought to be more than ever careful in view of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic dangers.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus did Piso defend Antony, reproaching his enemies and alarming them. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas evidently the cause of their not voting Antony an enemy. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the did not succeed in securing for him the governorship of the Gallic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince. The friends and relatives of the murderers prevented it, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlest, at the end of the war, Antony should join Octavius in avenging the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurder, for which reason they meant to keep Octavius and Antony always at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvariance with each other. They voted to offer Antony Macedonia instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Gallic province, and they ordered, either heedlessly or designedly, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other commands of the Senate be reduced to writing by Cicero and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered to the ambassadors. Cicero altered the decree and wrote as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows: \"Antony must raise the siege of Mutina forthwith, relinquish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine Gaul to Decimus, withdraw to the hither side of the river Rubicon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(which forms the boundary between Italy and the province) before a specified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday, and submit himself in all things to the Senate.\" Thus provokingly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalsely did Cicero write the orders of the Senate, not by reason of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying hostility, as it seems, but at the instigation of some evil\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit that was goading the republic to revolution and meditating\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestruction to Cicero himself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe remains of Trebonius having been lately brought home and the indignities\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisited upon them more carefully inquired into, the Senate with little\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposition declared Dolabella a public enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","13":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The ambassadors who had been sent to Antony, ashamed of the extraordinary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter of the orders, said nothing, but simply delivered them to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony in his wrath indulged in many invectives against the Senate and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero. \"He was astonished,\" he said, \"that they should consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar (the man who had contributed most to the Roman sway) a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrant and a king, and did not so consider Cicero, whom C\u00e6sar had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured in war and whose life he had spared, while Cicero in return now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprefers C\u00e6sar's assassins to his friends. He hated Decimus as long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the latter was the friend of C\u00e6sar, but loves him now that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas become his murderer. He favors a man who took the province of Gaul after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's death without authority, and makes war on one who received it at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hands of the people. He gives rewards to those who deserted from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions voted to me, and none to those who remain faithful, thus impairing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary discipline not more to my disadvantage than to that of the state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe has given amnesty to the murderers, to which I have assented on account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof two respectable men. He holds Antony and Dolabella as enemies because we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeep what was given to us. That is the real reason. And if I but withdraw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Gaul, then I am neither enemy nor monarch! I declare that I will bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto naught the amnesty with which they are not satisfied.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","14":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After saying much more to the same purpose Antony wrote his reply to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecree, saying that he would obey the Senate in all respects as the voice of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this country, but to Cicero, who wrote the orders, he would make the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing answer: \"The people gave me the province of Gaul by a law, and I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall prosecute Decimus for not obeying the law, and I shall visit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment for the murder upon him alone, as representative of them all, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder that the Senate, which now participates in the wickedness by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero's support of Decimus, may at last be purged of the shocking crime.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese words Antony spoke and wrote in reply. The Senate immediately voted him an enemy and also the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy under him if it should not abandon him. The government of Macedonia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIllyria, with the troops still remaining in both, was assigned to Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus until the republic should be re\u00ebstablished. The latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready had an army of his own and had received some troops from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApuleius. He also had war-ships and ships of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburden and about 16,000 talents in money and quantities of arms which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound in Demetrias, where they had been placed by Gaius C\u00e6sar long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, all of which the Senate now voted that he should use for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvantage of the republic. They voted that Cassius should be governor of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria and that he should make war against Dolabella, and that all other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommanders of Roman provinces and soldiers between the Adriatic sea and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOrient should obey the orders of Cassius and Brutus in all things. \n\t\t\t\t"},"8":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus quickly did the Senate seize the opportunity to put the affairs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius and his party in a brilliant aspect. When Octavius learned what had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen done he was troubled. He had considered the amnesty in the light of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tact of humanity and of pity for the relatives and compeers of these men, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the very small commands had been given them for their safety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely; finally, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirming of the Gallic province to Decimus seemed to him to have been done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby reason of the Senate's difference with Antony respecting the supreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower, on which ground also they were inciting him against Antony. But the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoting of Dolabella an enemy because he had put one of the murderers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath, the changing of the commands of Brutus and Cassius to the largest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, the granting of great armies and large sums of money to them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tputting them in command of all the governors beyond the Adriatic sea --all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed plainly to the building up of the party of Pompey and the pulling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown of that of C\u00e6sar. He bethought himself of their artifice in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreating him as a young man, in providing him a statue and a front seat, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving him the title of propr\u00e6tor, when in fact they were taking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom him what army he did have, for a proprietor has no authority when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls are serving with him. Then the rewards voted only to those of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers who had deserted from Antony to him were an indignity to those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad enlisted under him. Finally the war would be nothing but a disgrace to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, for the Senate would simply make use of him against Antony till the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter was crushed. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Meditating thus to himself he performed the sacrifices appertaining to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand assigned to him, and said to his army: \"I owe these honors of mine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto you, fellow-soldiers, not now merely but from the time when you gave me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe command; for the Senate conferred them upon me on account of you. Know,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, that my gratitude will be due to you for these things, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit will be expressed to you abundantly if the gods grant success to our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertakings.\" In this way he conciliated the soldiers and attached them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself. In the meantime, Pansa, one of the consuls, was collecting recruits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthroughout Italy, and the other one, Hirtius, shared the command of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces with Octavius, and as he was secretly ordered to do it by the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\the demanded as his share the two legions that had deserted from Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowing that they were the most reliable in the army. Octavius yielded to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in everything and they shared with each other and went into winter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters together. As winter advanced Decimus began to suffer from hunger,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Hirtius and Octavius advanced toward Mutina lest Antony should receive\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin surrender Decimus' army now weak with famine; but as Mutina was closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\themmed in by Antony, they did not venture to come to close quarters with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat once, but waited for Pansa. There were frequent cavalry engagements, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony had a much larger force of horse, but the difficulty of the ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was cut up by torrents, deprived him of the advantage of numbers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was the course of events around Mutina. At Rome, in the absence of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, Cicero took the lead by public speaking. He held frequent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassemblies, procured arms by inducing the artificers to work without pay,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected money, and exacted heavy contributions from the Antonians. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid without complaining in order to avoid calumny, until Publius Ventidius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had served under Gaius C\u00e6sar and was a friend of Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunable to endure the exactions of Cicero, betook himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's colonies, where he was well known, and raised two legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Antony and hastened to Rome to seize Cicero. The consternation was\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme. They removed most of the women and children in a panic, and Cicero\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself fled from the city. When Ventidius learned this he turned his course\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward Antony, but being intercepted by Octavius and Hirtius, he proceeded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Picenum, where he recruited another legion and waited to see what would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thappen. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPansa was drawing near with his army, Octavius and Hirtius sent Carsuleius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him with Octavius' pr\u00e6torian cohort and the Martian legion to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist him in passing through a defile. Antony had disdained to occupy the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefile as it served no other purpose than to hinder the enemy; but, eager to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight, and having no chance to win distinction with his cavalry, because the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground was marshy and cut by ditches, he placed his two best legions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambush in the marsh, where they were concealed by the reeds and where the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad, which had been thrown up artificially, was narrow. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Carsuleius and Pansa passed through the defile by night. At daybreak, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly the Martian legion and five other cohorts, they entered upon the road\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove mentioned, which was still free from enemies, and looked over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarsh on either side. There was a suspicious agitation of the bushes, then a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgleaming of shields and helmets, and Antony's pr\u00e6torian cohort\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly showed itself directly in their front. The Martian legion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded on all sides and having no way to escape, ordered the new levies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif they came up, not to join in the fight lest they should cause confusion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby their inexperience. The pr\u00e6torians of Octavius confronted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6torians of Antony. The other troops divided themselves in two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts and advanced into the marsh on either side, the one commanded by Pansa\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the other by Carsuleius. Thus there were two battles in two marshes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither division could see the other by reason of the elevated road, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong the road itself the praetorian cohorts fought another battle of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town. The Antonians were determined to punish the Martians for desertion as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing traitors to themselves. The Martians were equally determined to punish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Antonians for condoning the slaughter of their comrades at Brundusium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognizing in each other the flower of either army they hoped to decide the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole war by this single engagement. The one side was moved by shame lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits two legions should be beaten by one; the other by ambition that its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle legion should overcome the two. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus urged on rather by their own animosity and ambition than by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals they assailed each other, considering this their own affair. Being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveterans they raised no battle-cry, since they could not expect to terrify\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other, nor in the engagement did they utter a sound, either as victors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor vanquished. As there could be neither flanking nor charging in marshes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ditches, they stood together in close order, and since neither could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdislodge the other they locked together with their swords as in a wrestling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatch. No blow missed its mark. There were wounds and slaughter but no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcries, only groans; and when one fell he was instantly borne away and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother took his place. They needed neither admonition nor encouragement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince experience had made each one his own general. When they were overcome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby fatigue they drew apart from each other for a brief space to take breath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in gymnastic games, and then rushed again to the encounter. Amazement\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook possession of the new levies who had come up, as they beheld such deeds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone with such precision and in such silence. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t All put forth superhuman exertions, and the pr\u00e6torians of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished to the last man. Those of the Martians who were under Carsuleius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot the better of those opposed to them, who gave way, not in disgraceful\n\t\t\t\t\t\trout, but little by little. Those under Pansa were likewise in difficulties,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut they held out with equal bravery on both sides until Pansa was wounded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the abdomen by a javelin and carried off the field to Bononia. Then his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers retired, at first step by step, but afterward they turned and took\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefuge in flight. When the new levies saw this they fled in disorder, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith loud cries, to their camp, which the qu\u00e6stor, Torquatus, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput in readiness for them while the battle was in progress, apprehending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it might be needed. The new levies dashed into it confusedly although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were Italians, the same as the Martians, so much more than race does\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraining contribute to bravery. The Martians for fear of shame did not enter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the camp, but ranged themselves near it. Although fatigued they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill furious and ready to fight to the bitter end if anybody should attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Antony refrained from the attack as a bad job, but he fell upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew levies and made a great slaughter. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Hirtius near Mutina heard of this fight, at a distance of sixty stades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the hurried thither with the other legion that had deserted from Antony. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas already evening and the victorious Antonians were returning singing\n\t\t\t\t\t\thymns of triumph. While they were in loose order Hirtius made his appearance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin perfect order with his legion complete and fresh. The Antonians got\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves in line under compulsion, and performed against this foe also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany splendid deeds of valor; but being wearied by their recent exertions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were overcome by the fresh army opposed to them, and the greater part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them were slain in this encounter by Hirtius, although the latter did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursue, being apprehensive of the marshy ground. As darkness was coming on\n\t\t\t\t\t\the allowed them to escape. A wide stretch of the marsh was filled with arms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorpses, wounded men, and half-dead men. Some were unhurt but were overcome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby fatigue. Antony's cavalry, as many as he had with him, went to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance and collected them through the entire night. Some they put on\n\t\t\t\t\t\thorse-back in their own places, others they took on the horses with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, still others they urged to take hold of the horses' tails and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trun along with them and so secure their safety. Thus were Antony's forces,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter he had fought splendidly, scattered by the coming of Hirtius. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped without entrenchments in a village near the plain, named Forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGallorum. Antony and Pansa each lost about one-half of their men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe whole of Octavius' pr\u00e6torian cohort perished. The loss of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHirtius was slight. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"9":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The next day they all withdrew to the camps at Mutina. After so severe a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster Antony decided not to come to a general engagement with his enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat present, not even if they should attack him, but merely to harass them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaily with his cavalry until Decimus, who was reduced to extremity by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine, should surrender. For this very reason Hirtius and Octavius decided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto push on a fight. As Antony would not come out when they offered battle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey moved toward the other side of Mutina where it was less closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged on account of the badness of the ground, as if about to force their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway into the town with their strong army. Antony followed their movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his cavalry and this time also with those alone. As the enemy fought\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim with their cavalry only, moving the rest of their army in whatever way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey chose, Antony, lest he should lose Mutina, drew out of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrenchments two legions. Then his enemies rejoiced at this, turned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered battle. Antony ordered up other legions from other camps, but as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey came slowly, by reason of the suddenness of the call or the long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance, the army of Octavius won the victory. Hirtius even broke into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's camp, where he was killed, fighting near the general's tent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius rushed in and carried off his body and possessed himself of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp. A little later he was driven out by Antony. Both sides passed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight under arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony had suffered this second defeat, he took counsel with his friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly after the battle. They advised him to adhere to his first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresolution, to continue the siege of Mutina and not to go out and fight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying that the losses had been about equal on both sides, Hirtius having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen killed and Pansa wounded; that he (Antony) was superior in cavalry and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Mutina was reduced to extremity by famine and must soon succumb. Such\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the advise of his friends, and it was truly for the best. But Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow misled by a god, was fearful lest Octavius should make another attempt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto break into Mutina like that of yesterday, or even try to enclose him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Antony), as Octavius had the greater force of laborers, \" in which case,\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid he, \" our cavalry will be useless and Lepidus and Plancus will despise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme as a vanquished man. If we withdraw from Mutina, Ventidius will presently\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin us with three legions from Picenum, and Lepidus and Plancus will be\n\t\t\t\t\t\temboldened to ally themselves with us.\" So he spoke, although he was not a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimid man in the presence of danger; and breaking camp forthwith he made his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway toward the Alps. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Decimus was delivered from the siege he began to be afraid of Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom, after the removal of the two consuls, he feared as an enemy. So he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroke down the bridge over the river before daybreak and sent certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons to Octavius in a boat, as if to return thanks for rescuing him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked that Octavius would come to the opposite bank of the river to hold a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversation with him in the presence of the citizens as witnesses, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the could convince Octavius, he said, that an evil spirit had deceived him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand led him into the conspiracy against C\u00e6sar with the others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius answered the messengers in a tone of anger, declining the thanks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Decimus gave him, saying: \" I am here not to rescue Decimus, but to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight Antony, with whom I may properly come to terms sometime, but nature\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbids that I should even look at Decimus or hold any conversation with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. Let him have safety, however, as long as the authorities at Rome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplease.\" When Decimus heard this he stood on the river bank and, calling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius by name, read with a loud voice the letters of the Senate giving\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim command of the Gallic province, and forbade Octavius to cross the river\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout consular authority, into the government belonging to another, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to follow Antony further, because he (Decimus) would suffice for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuit of the latter. Octavius knew that he was prompted to this audacious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse by the Senate, and although able to seize him by giving an order, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspared him for the present and withdrew to Pansa at Bononia, where he wrote\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta full report to the Senate, and Pansa did likewise. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Rome Cicero read to the people the report of the consul, and to the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone that of Octavius. For the victory over Antony, he caused them to vote\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta thanksgiving of fifty days,-- a longer festivity than the Romans had ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecreed even after the Gallic or any other war. He induced them to give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy of the consuls to Decimus, although Pansa was still alive (for his life\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now despaired of), and to appoint Decimus the sole commander against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. Public prayers were offered that Decimus might prevail over him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSuch was Cicero's passion and want of decorum in reference to Antony. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed again, to the two legions that had deserted from Antony, the 5000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrachmas per man previously promised to them as the rewards of victory, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough they had already conquered, and gave them the perpetual right to wear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe olive crown at the public festivals. There was nothing about Octavius in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decrees, and his name was not even mentioned. He was forthwith\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarded as though Antony were already destroyed. They wrote to Lepidus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Plancus, and to Asinius Pollio to fight Antony when he should draw near\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Such was the course of events at Rome. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime Pansa was dying of his wound, and he summoned Octavius to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside, and said: \" I loved your father as I did myself, yet I could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenge his death, nor could I fail to unite with the majority, whom you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso done well to obey, although you have an army. At first they feared you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Antony, and especially Antony, as he seemed to be the one most ambitious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fill the r\u00f4le of C\u00e6sar, and they were delighted with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour dissensions, thinking that you would mutually destroy each other. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw you the master of an army, they complimented you as a young man\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith specious and inexpensive honors. When they saw that you were more proud\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand self-restrained in respect of honors than they had supposed, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially when you declined the magistracy that your army offered you, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere alarmed and they appointed you to the command with us in order that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight draw your two experienced legions away from you, hoping that when one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof you was vanquished the other would be weakened and isolated, and so the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole of C\u00e6sar's party would be effaced and that of Pompey be\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestored to power. This is their chief aim. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Hirtius and I did what we were ordered to do, until we could humble Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was much too arrogant; but we intended when he was vanquished to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim into alliance with you and thus to pay the debt of gratitude we owed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's friendship, the only payment that could be serviceable to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's party hereafter. It was not possible to communicate this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto you before, but now that Antony is vanquished and Hirtius dead, and I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to pay the debt of nature, the time for speaking has come, not that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may be grateful to me after my death, but that you, born to a happy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestiny, as your deeds proclaim, may know what is for your own interest, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow that the course taken by Hirtius and myself was a matter of necessity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe army that you yourself gave to us should most properly be given back to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou, and I do give it. If you can take and hold the new levies, I will give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou those also.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tqu\u00e6stor transferred them to Decimus as the Senate had ordered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius sent the bodies of Hirtius and Pansa with honors to Rome, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey received a public funeral. \n\t\t\t\t"},"10":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The following events took place in Syria and Macedonia about the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaius C\u00e6sar, when he passed through Syria, left a legion there, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was already contemplating an expedition against the Parthians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6cilius Bassus had charge of it, but the title of commander was\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld by Sextus Julius, a young man related to C\u00e6sar himself, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas given over to dissipation and who led the legion around everywhere in an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindecorous manner. Once when Bassus reproved him, he replied insultingly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sometime later, when he called Bassus to him and the latter was slow in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobeying, he ordered him to be dragged before him. A tumult and blows ensued.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe soldiers would not tolerate the indignity and stabbed Julius. This act\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas followed by repentance and fear of C\u00e6sar. Accordingly, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook an oath together that they would defend themselves to the death if they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not pardoned and restored to confidence, and they compelled Bassus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the same oath. They also enlisted and drilled another legion as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociates with themselves. This is one account of Bassus, but Libo \n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays that he belonged to the army of Pompey and that after the latter's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeat he became a private citizen in Tyre, where he corrupted certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers of the legion, who slew Sextus and chose Bassus for their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever that may have been, C\u00e6sar sent Statius Marcus against him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith three legions. Bassus defeated him badly. Finally, Marcus appealed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcius Crispus, the governor of Bithynia, and the latter came to his aid\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith three legions. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Bassus was besieged by the latter, Cassius suddenly came up with them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand took possession, not only of the two legions of Bassus, but also of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix that were besieging him, whose leaders surrendered in a friendly way and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobeyed him as proconsul; for the Senate had decreed, as I have already said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat all [beyond the Adriatic] should obey Cassius and Brutus. Just then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAllienus, who had been sent to Egypt by Dolabella, brought from that quarter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfour legions of soldiers dispersed by the disasters of Pompey and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrassus, or left with Cleopatra by C\u00e6sar. Cassius surrounded him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunawares in Palestine and compelled him to surrender, as he did not dare to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight with four legions against eight. Thus Cassius became the master, in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurprising way, of twelve legions, and laid siege to Dolabella, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming from Asia with two legions and had been received in Laodicea in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendly manner. The Senate was delighted when it heard the news. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Macedonia Gaius Antonius, the brother of Mark Antony, with one legion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot soldiers, contended with Brutus, and, being inferior in strength to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter, laid an ambuscade for him. Brutus avoided the trap, and, in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturn, laid an ambuscade, but he did no harm to those whom he caught in it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut ordered his own soldiers to salute their adversaries. Although the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter did not return the salutation or accept the courtesy he allowed them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto pass out of the trap unharmed. Then he went around by other roads and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfronted them again at a precipice, and again did them no harm but saluted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Then, regarding him as a saviour of his fellow-citizens, and as one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserving the reputation he had gained for wisdom and mildness, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconceived an admiration for him, saluted him, and passed over to him. Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso surrendered himself and was treated with honor by Brutus until he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconvicted of having tried several times to corrupt the army, when he was put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto death. Thus, including his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer forces, Brutus had possession of six legions, and since he approved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valor of the Macedonians he raised two legions among them, whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrilled in the Italian discipline. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was the state of affairs in Syria and Macedonia. In Italy Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough he considered it an insult that Decimus, instead of himself, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen general against Antony, concealed his indignation and asked the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors of a triumph for his exploits. Being disdained by the Senate as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough he were seeking honors beyond his years, he began to fear lest if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony were destroyed he should be despised still more, and so he desired a\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciliation with Antony, as Pansa on his death-bed had recommended to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, he began to make friends of those of Antony's army who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken prisoners, both officers and soldiers. He enrolled them among his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops, or if they wished to return to Antony he allowed them to do so, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to show that he was not moved by implacable hatred against him. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was encamped near to Ventidius, Antony's friend, who had command of three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, he inspired the latter with fear, but performed no hostile act, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin like manner gave him the opportunity to join himself or to go on safely\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his army to Antony, and told him to chide the latter for ignoring their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon interests. Ventidius took the hint and proceeded to join Antony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius also allowed Decius, one of Antony's officers, who had been taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprisoner at Mutina, and had been treated with honor, to return to Antony if\n\t\t\t\t\t\the wished, and when Decius tried to find out what were his sentiments toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, he said that he had given plenty of indications to persons of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscernment and that more would be insufficient for fools. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After conveying these hints to Antony, Octavius wrote still more plainly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus and Asinius concerning the indignities put upon himself and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapid advancement of the murderers, causing them to fear, lest in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of the favor extended to the Pompeian faction, each of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sarians should, one by one, share the fate of Antony, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was suffering the consequences of his own folly and arrogance. He advised that, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of appearances, they should obey the Senate, but that they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfer together for their own safety while they could still do so, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproach Antony for his conduct; that they should follow the example of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own soldiers, who did not separate even when theywere discharged from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe service but, in order that they might not be exposed to the assaults of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, preferred to unite their strength by settling together on ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat belonged not to them in groups, rather than enjoy their own homesteads\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingly. These things Octavius wrote to Lepidus and Asinius. The first soldiers of Decimus fell sick by reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof excessive eating after their famine, and suffered from dysentery, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnewer ones were still undrilled. Plancus soon joined him with his army, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen Decimus wrote to the Senate that he would pursue and capture Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Pompeians learned what had happened (and an astonishing number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed themselves to be of that party), they exclaimed that their ancestral\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom had at last been regained, and they each offered sacrifices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecemvirs were chosen to examine the accounts of Antony's magistracy. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a preliminary step to annulling C\u00e6sar's arrangements, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony had done little or nothing himself, but had conducted all the affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof state in accordance with C\u00e6sar's memoranda. The Senate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknew this well, but it hoped that by finding a pretext for annulling a part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the measures it should be enabled in the same way to annul the whole. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecemvirs gave public notice that whoever had received anything from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's government should make it known in writing immediately, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatened any who should disobey. The Pompeians also sought the consulship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the remainder of the year in place of Hirtius and Pansa. But Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso sought it, applying not to the Senate, but to Cicero privately, whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\turged to become his colleague, saying that Cicero should carry on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, as he was the elder and more experienced, and that he (Octavius)\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould enjoy the title only, by which means he could dismiss his army in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecoming manner, for which reason he had previously asked the honor of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumph. Cicero, whose desire for office was excited by this proposal, said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Senate that he understood that a negotiation was on foot among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals commanding the provinces, and he advised that they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconciliate the man whom they had treated with disdain and who was still at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head of a large army, and allow him to hold office in the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding his youth, rather than that he should remain under arms in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostile attitude. But lest he should do anything contrary to the interest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate, Cicero proposed that some man of prudence from among the older\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones should be chosen as his colleague as a firm check upon the immaturity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius. The Senate laughed at Cicero's ambition, and the relatives of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe conspirators especially opposed him, fearing lest Octavius, as consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould bring the murderers to punishment.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"11":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For various reasons the election was postponed in accordance with the law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, Antony passed over the Alps with the permission of Culleo, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been stationed there by Lepidus to guard them, and advanced to a river\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the latter was encamped. He neglected to surround himself with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpalisade and ditch, as though he were camping alongside a friend. Messengers\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere going back and forth between them constantly, Antony reminding Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their friendship and of his various good offices, and showing him that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter he (Antony) should be destroyed all who had enjoyed C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendship would suffer a like fate, one by one. Lepidus feared the Senate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had ordered him to make war on Antony, but he promised nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would not do so voluntarily. The army of Lepidus, having respect for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's dignity and perceiving the messengers going back and forth, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing gratified with the simple manners prevailing in Antony's camp, mingled\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his men, at first secretly, then openly, like fellow-citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-soldiers, disregarding the orders of the tribunes, who forbade their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoing so; and in order to facilitate their intercourse they made a bridge of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboats across the river. The so-called Tenth Legion, that had been enlisted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Antony originally, arranged things for him inside the camp of Lepidus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Laterensis, one of the distinguished members of the Senate, perceived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis he warned Lepidus. As the latter was incredulous Laterensis advised him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto divide his army in several parts and send them away on certain errands in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to test whether they were faithful or not. Accordingly, Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided them in three parts, and ordered them to go out by night in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotect some qu\u00e6stors who were approaching. About the last watch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers armed themselves as if for the march, seized the fortified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the camp, and opened the gates to Antony. The latter came running\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the tent of Lepidus, whose whole army was now escorting Antony, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesought Lepidus for peace and compassion to their unfortunate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizens. Lepidus leaped out of bed among them undressed, just as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas, promised to do what they asked, embraced Antony, and pleaded necessity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas his excuse. Some say that he fell on his knees before Antony, being an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinexperienced and timid man. Not all writers put faith in this report, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo I, for he had as yet done nothing whatever inimical to Antony and nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto cause fear. Thus did Antony again become a very powerful man and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformidable to his enemies. He had the army with which he had abandoned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsiege of Mutina, including its magnificent cavalry. Ventidius had joined him\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the road with three legions. Lepidus had become his ally with seven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions of foot soldiers and a great number of auxiliary troops and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparatus in proportion. Lepidus nominally retained the command of these,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut Antony directed every-thing. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When these facts became known at Rome a wonderful and sudden change took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace. Those who had just now held Antony in contempt were alarmed, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fears of others were changed to courage. The edicts of the decemvirs\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere torn down with derision and the consular election was still further\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostponed. The Senate, wholly at a loss what to do and fearful lest Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Antony should form an alliance, sent two of their number, Lucius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPansa, secretly to Brutus and Cassius, under pretence of attending the games\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Greece, to urge them to lend all the assistance possible. It recalled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Africa two of the three legions under Sextius, and ordered the third to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe given over to Cornificius, who commanded another portion of Africa, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho favored the senatorial party. Although they knew that these legions had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserved under Gaius C\u00e6sar, and although they suspected everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his, yet the want of other forces compelled them to take this course.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost awkwardly, too, they reappointed the young Octavius as general with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus against Antony, for they feared lest he should unite with Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius excited the army to anger against the Senate on account of its\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepeated indignities toward himself, and for requiring the soldiers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertake a second campaign before paying them the 5000 drachmas per man\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich it had promised to give them for the first. He advised them to send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ask for the money. They sent their centurions. The Senate understood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the men had been advised to this course by Octavius and said that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould make answer by its own legates. It sent the latter, under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstructions, to address themselves, when Octavius was not present, to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo legions which had deserted from Antony, and to advise the soldiers not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rest their hopes on a single person, but on the Senate, which alone had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperpetual power, and to go to the camp of Decimus, where they would find the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised money. Having delivered this charge to the legates it forwarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone-half of the donative and appointed ten men to divide it, to whom it did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot add Octavius as the eleventh. As the two legions refused to meet them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout Octavius, the legates returned leaving the business unfinished.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius no longer held communication with the troops through the medium of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers and no longer asked them to wait, but assembled the army and came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore them and related to them the indignities he had suffered from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and its purpose to destroy all the friends of Gaius C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone by one. He admonished them also to beware against being transferred to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral opposed to their party and sent to one war after another for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of being killed or arrayed in opposition to each other. This was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason why, after their common struggles at Mutina were ended, rewards were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven to only two legions, in order to induce strife and sedition in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"You know,\" he said, \"the reason why Antony was lately vanquished. You have\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard what the Pompeians in the city did to those who had received certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgifts from C\u00e6sar. What confidence can you have of keeping the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlands and money you have received from him, or what confidence can I have in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy own safety while the relatives of the murderers dominate the Senate ? I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall accept my fate, whatever it may be, for it is beautiful to suffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything in the service of a father; but I fear for you, such a host of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrave men, who have incurred danger in behalf of me and my father. You know\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I have been free from ambition from the time when I declined the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6torship that you offered me with the insignia of that office. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsee only one path of safety now for both of us, and that is that I obtain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship by your help. In that case all of my father's gifts to you\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be confirmed, the colonies that are still due to you will be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthcoming, and all your rewards will be paid in full; and after bringing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe murderers to punishment I will release you from any more wars.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At these words the army cheered heartily, and forthwith sent their centurions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ask the consulship for Octavius. When the Senate began to make talk about\n\t\t\t\t\t\this youth, the centurions replied, as they had been instructed, that in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tolden time Corvinus had held the office and at a later period the Scipios,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the elder and the younger, before the legal age, and that the country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofited much from the youth of each. They instanced, as recent examples,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey the Great and Dolabella and said that it had been granted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar himself to stand for the consulship ten years before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegal age. While the centurions were arguing with much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldness, some of the senators, who could not endure that army officers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould use such freedom of speech, rebuked them for exceeding the bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary discipline. When the army heard of this, they were still more\n\t\t\t\t\t\texasperated and demanded to be led immediately to the city, saying that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould hold a special election and elevate him to the consulship because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas C\u00e6sar's son. At the same time they extolled the elder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar without stint. When Octavius saw them in this excited state,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the led them directly from the assembly toward the city, eight legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot and a corresponding number of horse, and the auxiliary troops that were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserving with the legions. Having crossed the river Rubicon from the Gallic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince into Italy, -- the stream that his father crossed in like manner at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the civil war, -- he divided his army in two parts. One of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese divisions he ordered to follow in a leisurely way. The other and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter one, consisting of picked men, made forced marches, hastening in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to take the city unprepared. Meeting a convoy on the road with a part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the money which the Senate was sending as a present to the soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius feared the effect it might have on his mercenaries. So he secretly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent forward a force to scare away the convoy, and they took to flight with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe money. \n\t\t\t\t"},"12":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the news of Octavius' approach reached the city there was immense\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfusion and alarm. People ran hither and thither, and some conveyed their\n\t\t\t\t\t\twives and children and whatever they held most dear to the fields and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortified parts of the city, for it was not yet known that he aimed only at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecuring the consulship. Having heard that an army was advancing with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostile intentions, there was nothing that they did not fear. The Senate was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstruck with consternation since it had no military force in readiness. As is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tusual in cases of panic they blamed each other. Some were blamed because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had wrongfully deprived him of the command of the campaign against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, others because they had treated with contempt his demand for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumph, a request which was not without justice; others because they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvied him the honor of distributing the money; others because he had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen made an additional member of the board of ten. Still others said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army had become hostile because the gifts voted to them had not been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly and fully paid. They complained especially because of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinopportune time for such a strife, while Brutus and Cassius were far away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand their forces not yet organized, and on their own flank in a hostile\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattitude were Antony and Lepidus, who, they thought, might form an alliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Octavius. Thus their fears were greatly augmented. Cicero, who had so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong taken the lead, was nowhere to be seen. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There was a sudden change on all hands. Instead of 2500 drachmas 5000 were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven. Instead of two legions only, the entire eight were to be paid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius was appointed to make the distribution instead of the ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommissioners, and he was allowed to be a candidate for the consulship while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsent. Messengers were hastily despatched to tell him these things.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDirectly after they had left the city the Senate repented. It felt that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tought not to be so weakly terror-stricken, or accept a new tyranny without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbloodshed, or accustom those seeking office to gain it by violence, or the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers to govern the country by the word of command. Rather should they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarm themselves as far as possible and oppose the laws to the invaders, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was some hope that, if the laws were opposed to them, not even they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould bear arms against their country. If they should do so, it would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbest to endure a siege until Decimus and Plancus should come to the rescue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to defend themselves to the death rather than submit voluntarily to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslavery thenceforth without remedy. They recounted the high spirit and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendurance in behalf of freedom of the Romans of old, who never yielded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything prejudicial to their liberty. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As the two legions sent for from Africa happened to arrive in the harbor on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same day, it seemed as though the gods were urging them to defend their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom. Their regret for what they had done was confirmed; Cicero again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade his appearance, and they repealed all of the decrees above mentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll who were of military age were called to arms, also the two legions from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, and 1000 horse with them, and another legion that Pansa had left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind, all these were assigned to their proper places. Some of them guarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe so-called hill of Janiculum, where the money was stored, others held the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbridge over the Tiber, and the city pr\u00e6tors were put in command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe separate divisions. Others made ready small boats and ships in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharbor, together with money, in order to escape by sea in case they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe vanquished. While courageously making these hasty preparations they hoped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto alarm Octavius in his turn, and induce him to seek the consulship from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem instead of the army, or they hoped at least to defend themselves to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast extremity. They hoped also to change those of the opposite faction as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon as it became a contest for liberty. When they sought for the mother and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsister of Octavius, and did not discover them either in any open or secret\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabode, they were again alarmed at finding themselves deprived of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant hostages, and as the C\u00e6sarians showed no disposition to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyield to them they concluded that these women had been carefully concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Octavius was still giving audience to the messengers, it was announced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him that the decrees had been rescinded. The messengers thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew, covered with confusion. With his army still more exasperated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius hastened to the city, fearing lest some evil should befall his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmother and sister. To the plebeians, who were in a state of consternation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the sent horsemen in advance to tell them to have no fear. While all were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamazed he took a position just beyond the Quirinal hill, no one daring to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight or prevent him. Now another wonderful and sudden change took place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatricians flocked out and saluted him. The common people ran also and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmired the good order of the soldiers, which they considered a sign of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace. On the following day Octavius advanced toward the city, leaving his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy where it was, and having with him only a sufficient guard. Here, again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowds met him along the whole road and saluted him, omitting nothing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsavored of friendliness and weak compliance. His mother and sister, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the temple of Vesta with the Vestal virgins, embraced him. The three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, in spite of their generals, sent ambassadors and transferred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to him. One of the generals in command of them, Cornutus, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself. The others allied themselves with Octavius. When Cicero learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis he sought an interview with Octavius through friends. When it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgranted he defended himself and dwelt much upon his proposing Octavius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship, as he had done in the Senate on a former occasion. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered ironically that Cicero seemed to be the last of his friends to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreet him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The next night a rumor gained currency that two of Octavius' legions, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMartian and the Fourth, had gone over to the side of the republic, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had been led against their country by deception. The pr\u00e6tors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Senate put faith in this report heedlessly, although the army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery near, thinking that with the assistance of these two legions, as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the bravest, it would be possible to hold out against the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' army until some force from elsewhere should come to the rescue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe same night they sent Manius Aquilius Crassus to Picenum to raise troops,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ordered one of the tribunes, named Apuleius, to run through the city and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclaim the good news to the people. The senators assembled by night in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenate-house, and Cicero received them at the door, but when the news was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontradicted he took flight in a litter. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius laughed at them and moved his army nearer to the city and stationed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit in the Campus Martius. He did not then punish any of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6tors, not even Crassus who had rushed off to Picenum, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter was brought before him just as he was caught, in the disguise of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta slave. He pardoned all in order to acquire a reputation for clemency. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot long afterward they were put on the list of the proscribed. He ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the public money on the Janiculum or elsewhere be brought to him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the amount that had been previously ordered to be paid on the motion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero be distributed; that is, he divided 2500 drachmas per man and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to give them the remainder. Then he took his departure from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity until the consuls should be chosen by the comitia. Having been elected,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with Quintus Pedius, whom he desired to have as his colleague, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had given to him his own portion of his inheritance from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, he entered the city as consul. He offered the usual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifices, and twelve vultures were seen; the same number, they say, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to Romulus when he laid the foundations of the city. After the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifices he caused his adoption by his father to be ratified again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the lex curiata, -- that is, by a popular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvote, -- for the parts into which the tribes, or the common people, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided are called curi\u0153, just as I suppose the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar divisions among the Greeks are called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t phratri\u0153. Among the Romans this was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmethod of adoption most in accordance with law in the case of orphans; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who follow it have the same rights as real sons in respect of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatives and the freedmen of the persons who adopt them. Among the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsplendid accessories of C\u00e6sar was a large number of freedmen, many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them rich, and this was perhaps the principal reason why Octavius wanted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe adoption by a vote of the people in addition to the former adoption\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich came to him by C\u00e6sar's will. \n\t\t\t\t"},"13":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t He caused a new law to be passed to repeal the one which declared Dolabella a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic enemy, and also to punish the murder of C\u00e6sar. Indictments\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere found forthwith, the friends of C\u00e6sar bringing accusations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst some for actual participation in the crime and against others as\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving guilty knowledge only. Several were indicted, and among them some who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not in the city when C\u00e6sar was killed. One day was fixed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic proclamation for the trial of all, and judgment was taken against all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby default while Octavius was overlooking the court. None of the judges\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted for acquittal except one patrician, who then escaped with impunity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut was included with others in the proscription a little later. It appears\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat about this time Quintus Gallius, a city pr\u00e6tor and brother of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Gallius, who was serving with Antony, asked Octavius for the command\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Africa, and, being thus brought into his presence, attempted to take his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife. His colleagues stripped him of his pr\u00e6torship, the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttore his house down, and the Senate condemned him to death. Octavius ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to depart to his brother, and it is said that he took ship and was never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen again. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t These things accomplished, Octavius formed plans for a reconciliation with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, for he had learned that Brutus and Cassius had already collected\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty legions of soldiers, and he needed Antony's help against them. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoved out of the city toward the Adriatic coast and proceeded in a leisurely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway, waiting to see what the Senate would do. Pedius persuaded the senators,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter Octavius had taken his departure, not to make their differences with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other irremediable, but to be reconciled to Lepidus and Antony. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforesaw that such a reconciliation would not be for their advantage or for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of the country, but would be merely an assistance to Octavius against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius. Nevertheless, they gave their approval and assent to it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a matter of necessity. So the decrees declaring Antony and Lepidus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers under them, public enemies, were repealed, and others of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeaceful nature were sent to them. Thereupon Octavius wrote and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcongratulated them, and he promised to lend assistance to Antony against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus Brutus if he needed it. They replied to him at once in a friendly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit and eulogized him. Antony wrote that he would himself take vengeance\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Decimus for C\u00e6sar's account and on Plancus for his own, and that then he would join forces with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such were the letters which they exchanged with each other. While pursuing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecimus, Antony was joined by Asinius Pollio with two legions. Asinius also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought about an arrangement with Plancus, by virtue of which the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed over to Antony with three legions, so that Antony now had much the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongest force. Decimus had ten legions, of whom four, the most experienced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin war, had suffered severely from famine and were still enfeebled. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother six were new levies, still untrained and unaccustomed to their labors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs he despaired of fighting, he decided to flee to Marcus Brutus in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia. He retreated not by the higher Alps, but toward Ravenna and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia. Since C\u00e6sar had travelled by this route, Decimus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed another longer and more difficult one -- to cross the Rhine and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraverse the wild country of barbarian tribes. Thereupon the new levies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbewildered and fatigued, were the first to desert him and join Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter them the four older legions joined Antony, and the auxiliaries did the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame, except a body-guard of Gallic horse. Then Decimus allowed those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twished to do so to return to their own homes, and, after distributing among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem the gold he had with him, proceeded toward the Rhine with 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowers, the only ones who remained. As it was difficult to cross the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver with so few, he was now abandoned by all the others except ten. He put\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Gallic clothing, and, as he was acquainted with the language, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeded on his journey with these, passing himself off as a Gaul. He no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger followed the longer route, but went toward Aquileia, thinking that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould escape notice by reason of the smallness of his force. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having been captured by robbers and bound, he asked them who was the chief of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis Gallic tribe. He was informed that it was Camillus, a man to whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad done many favors. So he told them to bring him to Camillus. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter saw him led in, he greeted him in a friendly way in public, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscolded those who had bound him, for putting an indignity on so great a man\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough ignorance; but he sent word to Antony secretly. Antony was some-what\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttouched by this change of fortune, and was not willing to see Decimus, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\the ordered Camillus to kill him and send his head to himself. When he saw the head he ordered his attendants to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbury it. Such was the end of Decimus, who had been C\u00e6sar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpr\u00e6fect of horse and had governed Farther Gaul under him and had been designated by him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the consulship the coming year and for the governorship of Hither Gaul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe was the next of the murderers after Trebonius to meet punishment, within\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta year and a half of the assassination. About the same time Minucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBasilus, another of C\u00e6sar's murderers, was killed by his slaves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of whom he was castrating by way of punishment. \n\t\t\t\t"}},"3":{"0":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t THUS was punishment visited upon two of C\u00e6sar's murderers, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquered in their own provinces, Trebonius in Asia and Decimus Brutus in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul. How vengeance overtook Cassius and Marcus Brutus, who were the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprincipal leaders in the conspiracy against C\u00e6sar, and who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrolled the territory from Syria to Macedonia, and had large forces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcavalry and sailors, and more than twenty legions of infantry, together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships and money, this fourth book of the Civil Wars will show. During the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress of these events came the pursuit and capture of the proscribed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome and the sufferings consequent thereon, the like of which cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecalled among the civil commotions or wars of the Greeks, or those of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans themselves save only in the time of Sulla, who was the first to put\n\t\t\t\t\t\this enemies on a proscription list. Marius searched for his and punished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose whom he found, but Sulla proclaimed large rewards to persons who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould kill the proscribed and severe punishment to those who should conceal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. But what took place in the time of Marius and Sulla I have previously\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrated in the history relating to them. The following events came next in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius and Antony composed their differences on a small, gradually sloping\n\t\t\t\t\t\tislet in the river Lavinius, near the city of Mutina. Each had five legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof soldiers whom they stationed opposite each other, after which each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeded with 300 men to the bridges over the river. Lepidus himself went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore them, searched the island, and shook his military cloak as a signal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them to come. Then each left his three hundred in charge of friends on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bridges and advanced to the middle of the island in plain sight, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere the three sat together in council, Octavius in the centre because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas consul. They were in conference from morning till night for two days,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand came to these decisions: That Octavius should resign the consulship and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Ventidius should take it for the remainder of the year; that anew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistracy for quieting the civil dissensions should be created by law,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Lepidus, Antony, and Octavius should hold for five years with consular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower (for this name seemed preferable to that of dictator, perhaps because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Antony's decree abolishing the dictatorship); that these three should at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce designate the yearly magistrates of the city for the five years; that a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribution of the provinces should be made, giving to Antony the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul except the part bordering the Pyrenees Mountains, which was called Old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul. The latter, together with Spain, was assigned to Lepidus, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius was to have Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily, and the other islands in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vicinity thereof. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus was the dominion of the Romans divided by the triumvirate among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves. The assignment of the parts beyond the Adriatic only was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostponed, since these were still under the control of Brutus and Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst whom Antony and Octavius were to wage war. Lepidus was to be consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe following year and to remain in the city to do what was needful there,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeanwhile governing Spain by proxy. He was to retain three of his legions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard the city, and to divide the other seven between Octavius and Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree to the former and four to the latter, so that each of them might lead\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty legions to the war. To encourage the army with the expectation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbooty they promised them, beside other gifts, eighteen cities of Italy as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies -- cities which excelled in wealth, in the fertility of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterritory, and in handsome houses, and which were to be divided among them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(land, buildings, and all), just as though they had been captured from an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy in war. The most renowned among these were Capua, Rhegium, Venusia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeneventum, Nuceria, Ariminum, and Vibo. Thus were the most beautiful parts of Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarked out for the soldiers. But they decided to destroy their personal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies beforehand, so that the latter should not interfere with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements while they were carrying on war abroad. Having come to these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecisions, they reduced them to writing, and Octavius, as consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunicated them to the soldiers, all except the proscriptions. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers heard them they applauded and embraced each other in token of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmutual reconciliation. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While these transactions were taking place many fearful prodigies and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportents were observed at Rome. Dogs howled exactly like wolves -- a fearful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsign. Wolves darted through the forum -- an animal unused to the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCattle used the human voice. A newly born infant spoke. Sweat issued from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatues; some even sweated blood. Loud voices of men were heard and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclashing of arms and the tramp of horses where none could be seen. Many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearful signs were observed around the sun, there were showers of stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand continuous lightning fell upon the sacred temples and images; in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of which the Senate sent for diviners and soothsayers from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEtruria. The oldest of them said that the kingly rule of former times was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming back, and that they would all be slaves except himself, whereupon he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosed his mouth and held his breath till he was dead. \n\t\t\t\t"},"1":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the triumvirs were by themselves they joined in making a list of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were to be put to death. They put on the list those whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspected because of their power, and also their personal enemies, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswapped their own relatives and friends with each other for death, both then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand later. For they made additions to the catalogue from time to time, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the ground of enmity, others for a grudge merely, or because the victims\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttims were friends of their enemies or enemies of their friends. Some were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribed on account of their wealth, for the triumvirs needed a great deal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof money to carry on the war, since the revenue from Asia had been paid to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius, who were still collecting it, and the kings and satraps\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere co\u00f6perating with them. So the triumvirs were short of money\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Europe, and especially Italy, was exhausted by wars and exactions;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor which reason they levied very heavy contributions from the plebeians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinally even from women, and contemplated taxes on sales and rents. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere proscribed because they had handsome villas or city residences. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of senators who were sentenced to death and confiscation was about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t300, and of the so-called knights about 2000. There were brothers and uncles\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the triumvirs in the list of the proscribed, and also some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlieutenants serving under them who had had some difficulty with the leaders,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor with their fellow-lieutenants. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As they left the conference to proceed to Rome they postponed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscription of the greater number of victims, but they decided to send\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecutioners in advance and without warning to kill twelve, or, as some say,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseventeen, of the most important ones, among whom was Cicero. Four of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere slain immediately, either at banquets or as they were met on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreets. Search was made for the others in temples and houses. There was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsudden panic which lasted through the night, and a running to and fro with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcries and lamentation as in a captured city. When it was known that men had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen seized and massacred, although nobody had been previously sentenced by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscription, every man thought that he was the one whom the pursuers were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin search of. In despair some were on the point of burning their own houses,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand others the public buildings, or of committing some terrible deed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir frenzied state before the blow should fall upon them; and they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave done so had not the consul Pedius hurried around with heralds and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged them, telling them to wait till daylight and get more accurate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation. When morning came Pedius, contrary to the intention of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirs, published the list of seventeen as deemed the sole authors of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcivil strife and the only ones condemned. To the rest he pledged the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaith, being ignorant of the determinations of the triumvirs. Pedius died in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of fatigue the following night. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The triumvirs entered the city separately on three successive days, Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, and Lepidus, each with a pr\u00e6torian cohort and one legion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs they arrived, the city was speedily filled with arms and military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards, disposed in the most advantageous places. A public assembly was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthwith convened in the midst of these armed men, and the tribune Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitius proposed a law providing for a new magistracy for settling the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent disorders, to consist of three men to hold office for five years,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnamely, Lepidus, Antony, and Octavius, with the same power as consuls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Among the Greeks these would have been called harmosts, which is the name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Laced\u00e6monians gave to those whom they appointed over their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject states.) No time was given for consideration of this measure, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a future day appointed for voting on it, but it was passed forthwith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat same night, the proscription of 130 men in addition to the seventeen\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas proclaimed in various parts of the city, and a little later 150 more,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand additions to the lists were constantly made of those who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously condemned or killed by mistake, so that they might seem to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished justly. It was ordered that the heads of all the victims should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought to the triumvirs in order to adjust the rewards, which to a free\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson were payable in money and to a slave in both money and freedom. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere required to afford opportunity for searching their houses. Those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived fugitives, or concealed them, or refused to allow search to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade, were liable to the same penalties as the proscribed, and those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformed against concealers were allowed the same rewards [as those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled the proscribed]. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The proscription was in the following words: \" Marcus Lepidus, Mark Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Octavius C\u00e6sar, chosen by the people to set in order and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregulate the republic, do declare that, had not perfidious scoundrels begged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor mercy and when they obtained it become the enemies of their benefactors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand conspired against them, neither would Gaius C\u00e6sar have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain by those whom he saved by his clemency after capturing them in war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom he admitted to his friendship and upon whom he heaped offices, honors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand gifts; nor should we have been compelled to use severity against those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho have insulted us and declared us public enemies.

In order that they may remain unknown the names of those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho receive the rewards shall not be inscribed in our registers.\" Such was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe language of the proscription of the triumvirate as nearly as it can be\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendered from Latin into Greek. \n\t\t\t\t"},"2":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Lepidus was the first to begin the work of proscription, and his brother\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPaulus was the first on the list of the proscribed. Antony came next, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second name on the list was that of his uncle, Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo men had been the first to vote Lepidus and Antony public enemies. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthird and fourth victims were relatives of the consuls-elect for the coming\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, namely, Plotius, the brother of Plancus, and Quintus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather-in-law of Asinnius. These four were placed at the head of the list,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot so much on account of their dignity as to produce terror and despair, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat none of the proscribed might hope to escape. Among the proscribed was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThoranius, who was said by some to have been a tutor of Octavius. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlists were published, the gates and all the other exits from the city, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharbor, the marshes, the pools, and every other place that was suspected as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadapted to flight or concealment, were occupied by soldiers; the centurions\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere charged to scour the surrounding country. All these things took place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimultaneously. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Straightway, throughout city and country, wherever each one happened to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound, there were sudden arrests and murder in various forms, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecapitations for the sake of the rewards when the head should be shown;\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso undignified flights in strange costumes, of persons hitherto well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdressed. Some descended into wells, others into filthy sewers. Some took\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefuge in chimneys. Others crouched in the deepest silence under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthick-set tiles of their roofs. Some were not less fearful of their wives\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ill-disposed children than of the murderers. Others feared their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedmen and their slaves; creditors feared their debtors and neighbors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared neighbors who coveted their lands. There was a sudden outburst of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously smouldering hates and a shocking change in the condition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators, consulars, pr\u00e6tors, tribunes (men who were about to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenter upon those offices, or who had already held them), who threw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves with lamentations at the feet of their own slaves, giving to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservant the character of savior and master. It was most lamentable that even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter submitting to this humiliation they did not obtain pity. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Every kind of calamity was rife, but not as in ordinary sedition or military\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccupation, for in those cases the people had to fear only the members of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite faction, or the enemy, and could rely on their own domestics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut now they were more afraid of them than of the assassins, for as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer had nothing to fear on their own account, as in ordinary seditions or\n\t\t\t\t\t\twars, they were suddenly transformed from domestics into enemies, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom some concealed hatred, or in order to obtain the published rewards, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto possess themselves of the gold and silver in their masters' houses. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese reasons each one became treacherous to the household, preferring his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town gain to compassion for the home. Those who were faithful and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-disposed feared to aid, or conceal, or connive at the escape of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictims, because such acts made them liable to the very same punishments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was quite different from the peril that befell the seventeen men first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondemned. Then there was no proscription, but certain persons were arrested\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunexpectedly, and as all feared similar treatment all sheltered each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter the proscriptions some immediately became the betrayers of all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOthers, being free from danger themselves and eager for gain, became hunting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdogs for the murderers for the sake of the rewards. Of the remainder, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplundered the houses of the slain, and their private gains turned their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthoughts away from the public calamities; others, more prudent and upright,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere palsied with consternation. It seemed most astounding to them, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey reflected upon it, that while other states afflicted by civil strife\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been rescued by harmonizing the factions, in this case the dissensions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the leaders had wrought ruin in the first instance and their agreement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith each other had had like consequences afterwards. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Some died defending themselves against their slayers. Others made no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresistance, considering the assailants not to blame. Some starved, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\thanged, or drowned themselves, or flung themselves from their roofs or into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fire. Some offered themselves to the murderers or sent for them when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey delayed. Others concealed themselves and made abject entreaties, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdodged, or tried to buy themselves off. Some were killed by mistake, or by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate malice, contrary to the intention of the triumvirs. It was evident\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a corpse was not one of the proscribed if the head was still attached\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto it, for the heads of the proscribed were displayed on the rostra in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum, where it was necessary to bring them in order to get the rewards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEqually conspicuous were the fidelity and courage of others -- of wives, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildren, of brothers, of slaves, who rescued the proscribed or planned for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem in various ways, and died with them when they did not succeed in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigns. Some even killed themselves on the bodies of the slain. Of those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho made their escape some perished by shipwreck, ill luck pursuing them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe last. Others were preserved, contrary to expectation, to become city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates, commanders in war, and even to enjoy the honors of a triumph.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSuch a display of paradoxes did this time afford. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t These things took place not in an ordinary city, not in a weak and petty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkingdom; but the deity thus smote the most powerful mistress of so many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnations and of land and sea, and so brought about, after a long period of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, the present well-ordered condition. Other like events had taken place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the time of Sulla and even before him in that of Gaius Marius. The most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotable of these calamities I have narrated in my history of those times, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was the added horror that the dead were cast away unburied. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatters we are now considering are the more remarkable by reason of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdignity of the triumvirs and especially of one of them, who, by means of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter and good fortune, established the government on a firm foundation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand left his lineage and name to those who now rule after him. I shall now\n\t\t\t\t\t\trun over the most remarkable as well as the most shocking of these events,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich are all the more worthy to be remembered because they were the last of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe kind. I shall not speak of all, however, because the mere killing, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight, or subsequent return of those who were pardoned by the triumvirs at\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta later period and passed undistinguished lives at home, is not worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmention. I shall refer only to those which are calculated to astonish by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir extraordinary nature or to confirm what has already been said. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents are many, and they have been written in numerous books by many Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistorians successively. By way of summary, and to shorten my narrative, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall record a few of each kind in order to confirm the truth of each and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillustrate the happiness of the present time. \n\t\t\t\t"},"3":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The massacre began, as it happened, among those who were still in office, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first one slain was the tribune Salvius. His was, according to the laws,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sacred and inviolable office, endowed with the greatest powers, even that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof imprisoning the consuls in certain circumstances. Salvius was the tribune\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had at first prevented the Senate from declaring Antony a public enemy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut later he had co\u00f6perated with Cicero in everything. When he\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard of the agreement of the triumvirs, and of their hastening to the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the gave a banquet to his friends, believing that he should not have many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore opportunities for doing so. Soldiers burst in while the feast was going\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton. Some of the guests started up in tumultuous alarm, but the centurion in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand ordered them to resume their places and remain quiet. Then, seizing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvius by the hair, just as he was, the centurion drew him as far as need\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe across the table, cut off his head, and ordered the guests to stay where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were and make no disturbance unless they wished to suffer a like fate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo they remained after the centurion's departure, stupefied and speechless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttill the most silent watches of the night, reclining by the side of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune's body. The second one slain was the pr\u00e6tor Minucius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas holding the comitia in the forum. Learning that the soldiers were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeking him, he fled, and while he was still running about looking for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thiding-place he changed his clothes, and then darted into a shop, sending\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway his attendants and the insignia of his office. The attendants, moved by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshame and pity, lingered near the place, and thus unintentionally made the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovery of the pr\u00e6tor more easy to his slayers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Annalis, another pr\u00e6tor, was going around with his son, who was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcandidate for the qu\u00e6storship, and soliciting votes for him. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends who accompanied him, and those who bore his insignia of office, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey heard that he was on the list of the proscribed, ran away from him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnalis took refuge with one of his clients, who had in the suburbs a small,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmean apartment in every way despicable, where he remained safely concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil his son, suspecting that he had fled to this client, guided the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers to the place. The triumvirs gave him his father's fortune and\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised him to the \u00e6dileship. As he was returning home drunk he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell into a quarrel about something, and was killed by the same soldiers who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad killed his father. Thoranius, who was not then pr\u00e6tor but had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen such, and who was the father of a young man who was a scapegrace\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally, but had great influence with Antony, asked the centurions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpostpone his death for a short time, till his son could appeal to Antony for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. They laughed at him, and said, \"He has already appealed, but on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother side.\" When the old man knew this he asked for another very short\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval until he could see his daughter, and when he saw her he told her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to claim her share of the inheritance lest her brother should ask for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther death also from Antony. It happened in the son's case that, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsquandering his fortune in disgraceful ways, he was convicted of theft and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentenced to banishment. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cicero, who had held supreme power after C\u00e6sar's death, as much as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta public speaker could, was proscribed, together with his son, his brother,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand his brother's son and all of his household, his faction, and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends. He fled in a small boat, but as he could not endure the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseasickness, he landed and went to a country place of his own near\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCaieta, a town of Italy, which I visited to gain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of this lamentable affair, and here he remained quiet. While the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsearchers were approaching (for of all others Antony sought for him most\n\t\t\t\t\t\teagerly and the rest did so for Antony's sake), crows flew into his chamber\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand awakened him from sleep by their croaking, and pulled off his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbed-covering until his servants, perceiving that this was a warning from one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the gods, put him in a litter and again conveyed him toward the sea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing cautiously through a dense thicket. Many soldiers were hurrying around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin squads inquiring if Cicero had been seen anywhere. Some people, moved by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood-will and pity, said that he had already put to sea; but a shoemaker, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclient of Clodius, who had been a most bitter enemy of Cicero, pointed out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe path to L\u00e6na, the centurion, who was pursuing with a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce. The latter ran after him, and seeing slaves mustering for the defence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin much larger number than the force under his own command, he called out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway of stratagem, \"Come on, you centurions in the rear, this is the place;\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon the slaves, thinking that more soldiers were coming, were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterror-stricken. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t L\u00e6na, although he had been once saved by Cicero when under trial,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrew his head out of the litter and cut it off, striking it three times, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather sawing it off by reason \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CICERO \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the Hall of the Philosophers, Capitoline Museum,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t of his inexperience. He also cut off the hand with which Cicero had written\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe speeches against the tyranny of Antony and which he had entitled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilippics in imitation of those of Demosthenes. Then some of the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastened on horseback and others on shipboard to convey the good news\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly to Antony. The latter was sitting in front of the tribunal in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum when L\u00e6na, a long distance off, showed him the head and hand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby lifting them up and shaking them. Antony was delighted beyond measure. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowned the centurion and gave him 250,000 Attic drachmas in addition to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstipulated reward for killing the man who had been his greatest and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbitter enemy. The head and hand of Cicero were suspended for a long time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rostra in the forum where formerly he had been accustomed to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic speeches, and more people came together to behold this spectacle than\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad previously come to listen to him. It is said that even at his meals\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony placed the head of Cicero before his table, until he became satiated\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the horrid sight. Thus was Cicero, a man famous even yet for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\teloquence, and one who had rendered the greatest service to his country when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the held the office of consul, slain, and insulted after his death. His son\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been sent in advance to Brutus in Greece. Cicero's brother, Quintus, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured, together with his son. He begged the murderers to kill him before\n\t\t\t\t\t\this son, and the son prayed that he might be killed before his father. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers said that they would grant both requests, and, dividing themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto two parties, each taking one, killed them at the same time according to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Egnatii, father and son, while embracing each other, died by the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblow, and their heads were cut off while the remainder of their bodies were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill locked together. Balbus sent his son in advance of himself in flight\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward the sea in order that they might not be too conspicuous travelling\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether, and he followed at a short interval. Somebody told him, either by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign or by mistake, that his son had been captured. He went back and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered himself to the murderers. It happened, too, that his son perished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby shipwreck. Thus did ill luck add to the calamities of the time. Aruntius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a son who was not willing to fly without his father. The latter with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty persuaded him to seek his safety because he was young.

When the latter learned that his brother had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished he threw himself from a bridge into the Tiber. Some fishermen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseized him thinking that he had fallen into the water instead of leaping in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe resisted rescue and tried to throw himself into the river again. When he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas overcome by the fishermen he exclaimed, \"You are not saving me, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\truining yourselves by helping one who is proscribed.\" Nevertheless they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpity on him and saved him until some soldiers who were guarding the bridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw him, ran to him, and cut off his head. One of two brothers threw himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the river and one of his slaves searched for the body five days. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast he found it, and as it was still possible to recognize it, he cut off\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head for the sake of the reward. The other brother had concealed himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a dung-heap and another slave betrayed him. The murderers disdained to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the heap, but thrust their spears into him and dragged him out. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen cut off his head, just as he was, without washing it. Another one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeing his brother arrested ran up to him, not knowing that he was himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribed also, and said, \"Kill me instead of him.\" The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturion, having the proscription list at hand, said, \"Your request is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproper one, for your name comes before his.\" And so saying, he killed both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them in due order. Let these serve as examples in the case of brothers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Ligarius was concealed by his wife, who communicated the secret to only one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfemale slave.

He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame intimate with Antony and adhered to him until the latter became the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslave of Cleopatra. Then he heaped reproaches upon him and joined himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, who made him consul in place of Antony himself when the latter was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposed and again voted a public enemy. After the battle of Actium, where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld a naval command against Antony, Octavius sent him as a general against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe revolted Celts and awarded him a triumph for his victory over them. Bibulus was received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto favor at the same time with Messala, and was given a naval command by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, and often served as an intermediary in the negotiations between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Antony.

Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself he overlooked as being a person of no consequence. M\u00e6cenas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent the son to Octavius at Actium, but in order to spare his mother the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjourney on account of her sex, he demanded that she should give bail to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsul for her appearance before Octavius. As nobody offered bail for her,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus presented himself frequently at the door of Balbinus and also at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunal, and though the attendants long forced him away, he made himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard with difficulty to this effect: \"The accusers testify to my innocence,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince they say that I was not an accomplice of my wife and son. I did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause you to be proscribed, yet I am now inferior to the proscribed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsider the mutability of human affairs and grant to one, who stands by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour side, the favor of becoming security for my wife's appearance before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, or let me go there with her.\" When Lepidus had thus spoken,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBalbinus took pity on his reverse of fortune and released his wife from bail\n\t\t\t\t\t\taltogether. \n\t\t\t\t\t","15":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cicero, the son of Cicero, had been sent away to Greece by his father, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated these evils. From Greece he proceeded to join Brutus, and after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter's death he joined Pompeius, by both of whom he was honored with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary command. Afterward Octavius, by way of apology for his betrayal of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero, caused him to be appointed augur, and not long afterward consul and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen proconsul of Syria. When the news of the overthrow of Antony at Actium\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas forwarded by Octavius this same Cicero, as consul, announced it to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople and affixed it to the rostra where formerly his father's head had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen exhibited. Appius distributed his goods among his slaves and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed with them to Sicily. Being overtaken by a storm, the slaves formed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplot to get possession of his money, and placed Appius in a small boat,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretending to transfer him to a safer place; but it turned out that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treached port most unexpectedly, while their ship was wrecked and they all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished. Publius, qu\u00e6stor of Brutus, was solicited by the party\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Antony to betray his chief, but refused, and was for that reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribed. Afterward he was restored to citizenship and became a friend of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. Once when Octavius came to visit him Publius showed him some\n\t\t\t\t\t\timages of Brutus, and Octavius praised him for doing so. Such were some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most remarkable cases where the proscribed were lost or saved. Many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers I have omitted. \n\t\t\t\t"},"6":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While these transactions were taking place at Rome all the outlying countries\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere torn by hostilities growing out of the same commotion. Chief among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese wars was the one in Africa between Cornificius and Sextius, the one in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria between Cassius and Dolabella, and the one against Pompeius around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily. Many cities suffered the calamity of capture by siege. I shall pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the smaller ones and confine myself to the largest, and especially the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery celebrated ones of Laodicea, Tarsus, Rhodes, Patara, and Xanthus. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall relate briefly what took place at each of these. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t That part of Africa which the Romans took from the Carthaginians they still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcall Old Africa. The part that belonged to King Juba, and which was taken by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaius C\u00e6sar at a later period, they call for that reason New\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica; it might also be called Numidian Africa. Accordingly Sextius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld the government of New Africa as the appointee of Octavius, summoned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornificius to abandon Old Africa to him because the whole country had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned to Octavius in the allotment of the triumvirs. Cornificius replied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he did not know what allotment the triumvirs had made among themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that since he had received the government from the Senate he would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender it to anybody else without the order of the Senate. This was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\torigin of hostilities between them. Cornificius had the heavier and more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumerous army. That of Sextius was more nimble though inferior in number, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich means he was enabled to dash around and detach from Cornificius his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinland districts until he was besieged by Ventidius, a lieutenant of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornificius, who brought against him superior forces and whom he resisted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaliantly. L\u00e6lius, another lieutenant of Cornificius, ravaged the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince of Sextius, sat down before the city of Cirta, and laid siege to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Both parties sent ambassadors to secure the alliance of King Arabio and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe so-called Sittians, who received their name from the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstance. A certain Sittius, who was under accusation at Rome, took flight in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavoid trial. Collecting an army from Italy and Spain, he crossed over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, where he allied himself now with one and now with another of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twarring kings of that country. As those with whom he joined himself were\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways victorious, Sittius acquired a reputation and his army became\n\t\t\t\t\t\twonderfully efficient. When Gaius C\u00e6sar pursued the Pompeians to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica Sittius joined him and destroyed Juba's famous general, Saburra, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived from C\u00e6sar, as a reward for these services, the territory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Masinissa, not all, but the best part of it. Masinissa was the father of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis Arabio and the ally of Juba. C\u00e6sar gave his territory to this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSittius, and to Bocchus, the king of Mauritania, and Sittius divided his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportion among his soldiers. Arabio then fled to the sons of Pompey in Spain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe returned to Africa after C\u00e6sar's death and kept sending to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyounger Pompeius detachments of his men, whom he received back in a state of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood training. He expelled Bocchus from his territory and killed Sittius by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstratagem. Although for these reasons he was friendly toward the Pompeians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the nevertheless decided against that party, because it was so extremely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunlucky, and joined Sextius, through whom he acquired the favor of Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Sittians also joined him by reason of their friendship for the elder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus encouraged Sextius made a sortie by which Ventidius was killed and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy put to headlong flight. Sextius pursued them, killing and taking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprisoners. When L\u00e6lius heard the news he raised the siege of Cirta\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand joined Cornificius. Sextius, elated by his success, advanced against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornificius himself at Utica and encamped opposite him, although the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad the superior force. Cornificius sent L\u00e6lius with his cavalry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make a reconnoissance, and Sextius ordered Arabio to engage him with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town cavalry in front, and Sextius himself with his light troops fell upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy's flank and threw them into such confusion that L\u00e6lius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough not vanquished, feared lest his retreat should be cut off and took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of a hill near by. Arabio hung upon his rear, killed many, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded the hill. When Cornificius saw this he sallied out with a larger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce to assist L\u00e6lius. Sextius, who was in his rear, dashed up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand attacked him, but Cornificius turned upon him and drove him back,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough suffering severely. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile Arabio, with a band of men accustomed to climbing rocks, scaled a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprecipice to the camp of Cornificius and stole into it unobserved. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp was captured Roscius, the custodian, offered his throat to one of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistants and was killed. Cornificius, overcome by the fatigue of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement, retired toward L\u00e6lius on the hill, not yet knowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat had happened to his camp. While he was retreating the cavalry of Arabio\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged upon him and killed him, and when L\u00e6lius, looking down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the hill, saw what had happened he killed himself. When the leaders had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen the soldiers fled in various directions. Of the proscribed who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Cornificius, some crossed over to Sicily, others took refuge wherever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey could. Sextius gave great spoils to Arabio and the Sittians. He brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cities into allegiance to Octavius and granted pardon to all. This was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end of the war in Africa between Sextius and Cornificius, which seemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinconsiderable by reason of the rapidity with which it was prosecuted. \n\t\t\t\t"},"7":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Resuming the narrative of Cassius and Brutus, I shall repeat some small part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof what has already been said, in order to refresh the memory. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar was assassinated his murderers took possession of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, and when amnesty was voted to them they came down. The people were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatly moved at C\u00e6sar's funeral and scoured the city in pursuit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his murderers. The latter defended themselves from the roofs of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouses, and those of them who had been appointed by C\u00e6sar himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas governors of provinces departed from the city forthwith. Cassius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus were still city pr\u00e6tors. Cassius had been chosen by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar as governor of Syria and Brutus of Macedonia. As they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot enter at once upon these offices, and as they were afraid to remain in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city, they took their departure while still pr\u00e6tors, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, for the sake of appearances, gave them charge of the supply of corn,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that they might not seem to have taken flight in the interval. After they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad gone, the provinces of Syria and Macedonia were transferred to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls Dolabella and Antony much against the will of the Senate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, Cyrene and Crete were given to Brutus and Cassius in exchange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese provinces they despised because of their insignificance, and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordingly, they set about raising troops and money in order to invade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSyria and Macedonia. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were thus engaged Dolabella put Trebonius to death in Asia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony besieged Decimus Brutus in Cisalpine Gaul. The Senate in indignation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted both Dolabella and Antony public enemies, and restored both Brutus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius to the former commands and added Illyria to that of Brutus. It also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered all other persons holding commands of Roman provinces or armies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the Adriatic and Syria, to obey the orders of Cassius and Brutus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThereupon Cassius anticipated Dolabella by entering Syria, where he raised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe standards of a governor and won over twelve legions of soldiers who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen enlisted and trained by Gaius C\u00e6sar long before. One of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar had left in Syria when he was contemplating a war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Parthians, and had placed it under the charge of C\u00e6cilius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBassus, but had given the nominal command to Sextus Julius, a young man who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas his kinsman. This Julius was a fellow of loose habits who led the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegion into shameful dissipations and once insulted Bassus when the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremonstrated with him. Afterward he summoned Bassus to his presence, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the latter delayed he ordered that he be dragged before him. There was\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta disgraceful tumult in consequence, and some blows were given to Bassus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sight of which the army resented, and Julius was stabbed. This act was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed straightway by repentance and fear of C\u00e6sar, and so they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbound each other by an oath that, unless they were granted pardon and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciliation, they would fight to the death; and they compelled Bassus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the same oath. They recruited another legion and both were drilled\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether. C\u00e6sar sent Statius Murcus against them with three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, but they resisted bravely. Marcius Crispus was then sent from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBithynia to the aid of Murcus with three additional legions, and thus Bassus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas besieged by six legions altogether. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cassius speedily intervened in this siege and took command at once of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy of Bassus with its consent, and afterward of the legions of Murcus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcius, who surrendered them to him in a friendly way and in pursuance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decree of the Senate, which they obeyed in all respects. About the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime Allienus, who had been sent to Egypt by Dolabella, brought from that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry four legions composed of men who had been dispersed after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisasters of Pompey and Crassus, and who had been left with Cleopatra by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. Cassius surrounded him in Palestine unexpectedly, while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas in ignorance of what had happened, and compelled him to come to terms\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand surrender his army, as he did not dare to fight with four legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst eight. Thus in a marvellous manner Cassius came into possession of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwelve first-rate legions, to whom were added a certain number of Parthian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmounted bowmen, who were attracted by the reputation he had acquired among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem from the time when, as qu\u00e6stor to Crassus, he had shown\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself to be more skilful than that general. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Dolabella was spending his time in Ionia, having put Trebonius to death,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevied tribute on the towns, and hired a naval force, by means of Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFigulus, from the Rhodians, Lycians, Pamphylians, and Cilicians. When this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas in readiness he advanced toward Syria, leading two legions by land while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFigulus proceeded by sea. After he had learned of the forces of Cassius he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed on to Laodicea, a city friendly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, situated on a peninsula, fortified on the landward side and having\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta roadstead in the sea, so that supplies might be easily obtained by water\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he might sail away securely whenever he wished. When Cassius learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, fearing lest Dolabella should escape him, he threw up a mound across\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe isthmus, two stades in length, composed of stones and all sorts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterial brought together from suburban houses and tombs, and at the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime sent to Phoenicia, Lycia, and Rhodes for ships. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Being refused by all except the Sidonians, he came to a naval engagement with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella, in which a number of ships were sunk on both sides and Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured five with their crews. Then Cassius again sent to those who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\trejected his application, and also to Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSerapio, her viceroy in Cyprus. The Tyrians, the Aradii, and Serapio,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout consulting Cleopatra, sent Cassius what ships they had. The queen\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcused herself on the ground that Egypt was at that time suffering from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine and pestilence, but she was really cooperating with Dolabella on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of her relations with the elder C\u00e6sar. This was the reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhy she had sent him the four legions by Allienus, and had another fleet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready to assist him, which was kept back by adverse winds. The Rhodians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Lycians said that they would help neither Cassius nor Brutus in civil\n\t\t\t\t\t\twars, and that when they supplied ships to Dolabella they furnished them as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan escort, not knowing that they were to be used as allies in war. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Cassius was again ready with the forces in hand he engaged Dolabella a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond time. The first battle was doubtful, but in the next one Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas beaten on the sea. Then Cassius completed his mound and battered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella's walls till they trembled. He tried unsuccessfully to corrupt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarsus, the captain of the night-watch, but he bribed the centurions of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday force and, while Marsus was taking his rest, effected an entrance by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaylight through a number of small gates that were secretly opened to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone after another. When the city was taken Dolabella offered his head to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town body-guard and told him to cut it off and carry it to Cassius in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto secure his own safety. The guard cut it off, but he killed himself also,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Marsus took his own life. Cassius swore Dolabella's army into his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice. He plundered the temples and the treasury of Laodicea, punished the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchief citizens, and exacted very heavy contributions from the rest, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city was reduced to the extremest misery. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After the capture of Laodicea Cassius turned his attention to Egypt. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned that Cleopatra was about to join Octavius and Antony with a strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet, he purposed to prevent its sailing and to punish the queen for her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintention. He had before this thought that the condition of Egypt was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially favorable for these designs, because it was wasted by famine and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad no considerable foreign army, now that the forces of Allienus had taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir departure. In the midst of his eagerness, his hopes, and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity came a hasty summons from Brutus telling him that Octavius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony were crossing the Adriatic. Cassius reluctantly gave up his hopes in\n\t\t\t\t\t\trespect of Egypt. He also sent back his Parthian mounted bowmen with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresents, and with them ambassadors to their king asking for a larger force\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof auxiliaries. This force arrived after the decisive battle, ravaged Syria\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand many of the neighboring provinces as far as Ionia, and then returned\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome. Cassius left his nephew in Syria with one legion and sent his cavalry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin advance into Cappadocia, who presently killed Ariobarzanes for plotting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Cassius. Then they seized his large treasures and other military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies and brought them to Cassius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of Tarsus were divided into factions. One of these factions had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowned Cassius, who was the first to arrive. The other had done the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Dolabella, who came later. Both had acted thus in the name of the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the inhabitants bestowed their honors upon each alternately, each of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreated it despitefully as a fickleminded place. After Cassius had overcome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella he levied a contribution on it of 1500\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttalents. Being unable to find the money, and being pressed for payment with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolence by the soldiers, the people sold all their public property and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter that they coined all the sacred articles used in religious processions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the temple offerings into money. As this was not sufficient, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates sold free persons into bondage, first girls and boys, afterward\n\t\t\t\t\t\twomen and miserable old men, who brought a very small price, and finally\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyoung men. Most of these committed suicide. Finally Cassius, on his return\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria, took pity on their sufferings and released them from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of the contribution. Such were the calamities that befell Tarsus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Laodicea. \n\t\t\t\t"},"8":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Brutus and Cassius had their conference, Brutus was in favor of uniting their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies and making Macedonia their chief concern, since the enemy had forty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, of which eight had already crossed the Adriatic. Cassius was of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topinion that the enemy might still be disregarded, believing that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaste away for want of supplies by reason of their great numbers. He thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit would be best to subvert the Rhodians and Lycians, who were friendly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Antony and who had fleets, lest they should fall upon the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the republicans while the latter were busy with the enemy. Having decided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto do this, they separated, Brutus proceeding against the Lycians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius against Rhodes, in which place he was brought up, and educated in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe literature of Greece. As he had to contend with men of superior naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprowess, he prepared his own ships with care, filled them with troops, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrilled them at Myndus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Rhodians of distinction were alarmed at the prospect of a conflict with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, but the common people were in high spirits, because they recalled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer victories achieved over men of different character. They launched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirty-three of their best ships, but while doing so they sent messengers to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyndus nevertheless to urge Cassius not to despise Rhodes, which had always\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefended herself against those who underestimated her, and not to disregard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe treaty which existed between the Rhodians and the Romans which bound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem not to bear arms against each other. If he complained of them for not\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendering military assistance, they would be glad to hear from the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and if called upon they would lend such assistance. When they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspoken thus Cassius replied that as to the other matters war would decide instead of words, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas regarded the treaty, which forbade them to bear arms against each other,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Rhodians had violated it by allying themselves with Dolabella against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius. The treaty required them to assist each other in war, but when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius asked for assistance they quibbled about the Roman Senate, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither in flight or held captive at present by the tyrants who had mastered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city. Those tyrants would be punished, and the Rhodians would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunished also for siding with them, unless they speedily obeyed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands. Such was the answer Cassius returned to them. The more prudent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians were still more alarmed, but the multitude were excited by two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic speakers named Alexander and Mnaseas, who reminded them that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates had invaded Rhodes with a still larger fleet, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemetrius had done so before him; whereupon they elected Alexander as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprytanis, who is the magistrate exercising the supreme power among them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMnaseas as admiral of their fleet. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, they sent still another ambassador to Cassius in the person of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchelaus, who had been his teacher in Greek literature in Rhodes, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent a more earnest petition. This he did, taking Cassius by the right\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand in a familiar manner, and saying, \"O friend of the Greeks, do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubvert a Greek city. O friend of freedom, do not attack Rhodes. Do not put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto shame the glory of a Doric state hitherto unvanquished. Do not forget the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamous histories you learned both at Rhodes and at Rome -- at Rhodes, what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Rhodians accomplished against states and kings (and especially against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemetrius and Mithridates, who were deemed invincible), in behalf of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom for which you say that you also are now contending -- at Rome, our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices to you, among others those that were rendered when we fought with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou against Antiochus the Great, concerning which you have monuments\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinscribed in our honor. So much, O Roman, for our race, our dignity, our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition hitherto unenslaved, our alliance, and our good-will toward you. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"As for you, Cassius, you owe a peculiar reverence to this city in which you\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere brought up and educated, restored to health when sick, where you had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour hearthstone, and where you attended my very school. You owe respect to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme who have hoped that I should some time plume myself on your education\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith different hopes, but I am now pleading this relation in behalf of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry, lest it be forced into a war with you, its pupil and its ward,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere one of two things must necessarily happen: either that the Rhodians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperish utterly, or Cassius be defeated. In addition to my entreaty I give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou the advice that while engaged in such important tasks in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman commonwealth you take the gods for your leaders at every step. You,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, swore by the gods when you recently concluded the treaty with us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough Gaius C\u00e6sar, and to the oaths you added libations and gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right hand, which is valid even among enemies, not to mention friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wards. Besides dreading the judgment of the gods, have regard for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topinions of mankind, who consider nothing more base than a violation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreaties, which causes the violators to be distrusted in all respects by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth friends and enemies.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the old man had thus spoken he did not let go Cassius' hand, but shed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttears on it, so that Cassius blushed at the spectacle and was moved somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the sense of shame, yet he drew away his hand, and said, \"If you have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounselled the Rhodians not to wrong me, you have yourself done me wrong. If\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have so counselled them and they have not followed your advice I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenge you. That I have suffered injury is plain enough. The first wrong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone me was when I asked assistance and was slighted by my guardians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstructors. In the next place they gave the preference to Dolabella, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had not brought up and educated, rather than to me. And what makes it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworse, O freedom-loving Rhodians, is that Brutus and I and the noblest men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Senate, whom you see here, were fugitives from tyranny for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendeavoring to liberate their country, while Dolabella was seeking to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenslave it to others, whom you also favor while pretending to abstain from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour civil wars. This would be a civil war if we also were aiming at supreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower, but it is plainly a war of the republic against monarchy. And you,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho appeal to me in behalf of your own freedom, have refused aid to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepublic. While professing friendship for the Romans you have no pity for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who have been sentenced to death and confiscation without trial. You\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretend that you want to hear from the Senate, which is suffering from these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery evils and is not yet able to defend itself. But the Senate had answered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou beforehand when it decreed that all the peoples of the Orient should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlend aid to Brutus and myself. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Whatever aid you have rendered us when we were adding to our possessions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(for which you reaped an abundant reward) you remind us of, but when in our\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of adversity you fail us in the struggle for freedom and safety, you\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave very short memories. Even if we had had no relations with each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, you ought, as members of the Doric race, to be willing to begin now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fight for the Roman republic. Instead of such thoughts and deeds you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquote to us treaties, -- treaties made with you by Gaius C\u00e6sar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe founder of the present monarchy, -- yet these very treaties say that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans and the Rhodians shall assist each other in case of need. Therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist the Romans in the time of their greatest peril! It is Cassius who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquotes these very treaties to you and calls for your help in war, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius, a Roman citizen and a Roman general, whom, as the Senate's decree\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays, all the countries beyond the Adriatic are required to obey. The same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrees are presented to you by Brutus, and also by Pompeius, who has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested by the Senate with the command of the sea. Added to these decrees\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the prayers of all these senators who have fled, some to myself and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus, and others to Pompeius. The treaty provides that the Rhodians shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlend aid to the Romans even in cases where the application is made by single\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividuals. If you do not consider us as generals or even as Romans, but as\n\t\t\t\t\t\texiles, or strangers, or persons condemned, as the proscribers call us, O\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians, you have no treaties with us, but only with the Roman people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing strangers and foreigners to the treaties, we will fight you till you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobey our orders in everything.\" With this ironical remark Cassius sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchelaus away. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Alexander and Mnaseas, the Rhodian leaders, put to sea with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirty-three ships against Cassius at Myndus, intending to surprise him by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe suddenness of their attack. They built their hopes somewhat lightly on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe supposition that by sailing against Mithridates at Myndus they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought that war to a successful end. In order to display their seamanship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey took their station the first day at Cnidus. The next day they showed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to the forces of Cassius on the high sea. The latter in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tastonishment put to sea against them, and it was a battle of strength and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tskill on both sides. The Rhodians with their light ships darted swiftly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the enemy's line, turned around, and attacked them in the rear. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans had heavier ships, and whenever they could come to close quarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey prevailed, as in an engagement on land, by their greater strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius, by reason of his more numerous fleet, was enabled to surround his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, and then the latter could no longer turn and dart through his line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen they could only attack in front and then haul off, their nautical skill\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas of no avail in the narrow space where they were confined. The ramming\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their prows and broadside movements against the heavier Roman ships did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle damage, while those of the Romans against the lighter vessels were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore effective. Finally, three Rhodian ships were captured with their crews,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo were rammed and sunk, and the remainder took flight to Rhodes in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamaged condition. All of the Roman ships returned to Myndus, where they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere repaired, the greater part having suffered injury. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was the result of the naval engagement of the Romans and the Rhodians at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyndus. Cassius watched the fight while it was going on from the summit of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmountain. When he had repaired his ships he sailed to Loryma, a fortified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace belonging to the Rhodians on the mainland opposite the island, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he sent his foot-soldiers across in transports under the command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFannius and Lentulus. He advanced in person with eighty ships rigged in a way to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce terror. He surrounded Rhodes with his land and naval forces, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen remained quiet, expecting that the enemy would show signs of weakening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut they sailed out again valiantly and, after losing two more ships, were\n\t\t\t\t\t\themmed in on all sides. Then they mounted the walls, heaped them with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmissiles, and resisted simultaneously the soldiers of Fannius, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassailing them on the landward side, and Cassius, who was advancing his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnaval force, prepared for wall-fighting, against the defences on the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnticipating such a necessity he had brought with him turrets in sections,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were then elevated. Thus was Rhodes, after suffering two naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeats, beleaguered by land and sea, and, as frequently happens in sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unexpected trouble, found herself wholly unprepared for siege; whence it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame evident that the city must speedily be taken either by assault or by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine. The more intelligent of the Rhodians perceived this and opened\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunications with Fannius and Lentulus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were doing so Cassius suddenly made his appearance in the midst of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city with a chosen band of soldiers, without any show of violence or use\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ladders. Most people conjectured, as seemed the fact, that those of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens who were favorable to him had opened the small gates, being moved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby pity for the town and the apprehension of famine. Thus was Rhodes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured; and Cassius took his seat on the tribunal and planted a spear by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe side of it to indicate that he had taken the city by force. Laying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrict commands upon his soldiers to remain quiet, and threatening with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath any who should resort to violence or plunder, he summoned by name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout fifty citizens, and punished with death those who were led before him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe others, who were not found, numbering about twenty-five, he ordered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe banished. All the money that was found, either gold or silver, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemples and the public treasury, he seized, and he ordered private citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had any to bring it to him on a day named, proclaiming death to those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho should conceal it, together with a reward of one-tenth to informers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom in addition in the case of slaves. At first many concealed what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad, hoping that in the end the threat would not be carried out, but when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw the rewards paid and those who had been informed against punished,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey became alarmed, and having procured the appointment of another day,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of them dug their money out of the ground, others drew it out of wells,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand others brought it from tombs, in much larger amounts than the former\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcollections. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such were the calamities that befell the Rhodians. Lucius Varus was left in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharge of them with a garrison. Cassius, although delighted with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickness of the capture and the quantity of money taken, nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered all the other peoples of Asia to pay ten years' tribute, and this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey did within a short space of time. News now reached him that Cleopatra\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas about to sail with a large fleet and very extensive apparatus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Antony. She had espoused their cause previously on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther relations with the first C\u00e6sar, and now she espoused it all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe more by reason of her fear of Cassius. The latter sent Murcus, with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegion of the best soldiers and a certain number of archers, with sixty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecked ships, to the Peloponnesus, to lie in wait in the neighborhood of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tT\u00e6narum and to collect what booty they could from that country.\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"9":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t We will now relate the transactions of Brutus in Lycia, first glancing at\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat has been mentioned above in order to refresh the memory. When he had received from Apuleius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain soldiers which the latter had under his command, together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t16,000 talents in money which Apuleius had collected from the tribute of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia, he passed into B\u0153otia. The Senate having voted that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould use this money for his present necessities and that he should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand of Macedonia, and of Illyria in addition, he came into possession of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree legions of soldiers which Vatinius, the former governor of Illyria,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered to him. Another one he captured from Gaius, the brother of Mark\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, in Macedonia. He collected four more in addition to these, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had eight legions in all, most of whom had served under Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar. He had a large force of cavalry, light-armed troops, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarchers. He had a high opinion of his Macedonian soldiers and he trained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem in the Roman discipline. While he was still collecting soldiers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney a piece of good luck came to him from Thrace, of the following sort.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPolemocratia, the wife of one of the Thracian princes, whose husband had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen killed by his enemies, being alarmed for her son, who was still a boy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame to Brutus bringing the boy, whom she placed in his hands together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther husband's treasures. Brutus delivered the boy to the inhabitants of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCyzicus to be cared for until he (Brutus) should have leisure to restore him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his kingdom. Among the treasures he found an unexpected quantity of gold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand silver. This he stamped and converted into money. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Cassius came, and it was decided to begin by reducing the Lycians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians, Brutus turned his attention first to the inhabitants of Xanthus in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLycia. The latter destroyed their suburbs in order that Brutus might not effect a lodgment or find material there. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso surrounded the city with a trench and embankment of more than fifty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeet vertically and of corresponding breadth, from which they fought, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat standing upon it they could hurl darts and shoot arrows as though\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotected by an impassable river. Brutus invested the place, pushed forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoverings for his workmen, divided his army into day and night forces,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought up material from long distances, hurrying and cheering as in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontests for prizes, and spared neither zeal nor labor. So the work which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseemed most likely could not be done at all in the face of an opposing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, or only at the end of many months, was accomplished by him in a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdays. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The Xanthians were now subjected to close siege. Brutus attacked them now\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith battering-rams against the walls, now by assaults upon the gates with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot-soldiers, whom he kept changing continually. The defenders, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfatigued by being always pitted against fresh soldiers, and all wounded,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless held out as long as their parapets remained. When these were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattered down and the towers broken through, Brutus, foreseeing what would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen, ordered those who were attacking the gates to withdraw. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXanthians, thinking that the enemy's works were deserted and unguarded,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdarted out by night to set fire to the machines. Suddenly the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked them as ordered, and they again fled to the gates, the guards of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich closed them before they entered, fearing lest the enemy should rush in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith them -- in consequence of which there was around the gates a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter of the Xanthians who were shut out. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Soon afterwards the remainder made a fresh sally about midday, and as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesiegers withdrew again, they burned all the machines. As the gates were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft open for them on account of the former calamity, about 2000 Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroke in with them. While others were pushing in at the entrance the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportcullis suddenly fell upon them, either by the design of the Xanthians or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe accidental breaking of the ropes, so that some of the Romans who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforcing their way in were crushed and the others found their retreat cut\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff, as they could not raise the portcullis without the hoisting apparatus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPelted by missiles hurled upon them by the Xanthians from the roofs in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrow streets, they forced their way with difficulty till they came to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum, which was near by, and there they overcame the forces which were at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclose quarters with them, but, being under a heavy volley of arrows and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving themselves neither bows nor javelins, they took refuge in the temple\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Sarpedon to avoid being surrounded. The Romans who were outside the walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere excited and anxious for those inside, and tried every means [to effect\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan entrance], Brutus meantime darting hither and thither, but they were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\table to break the portcullis, which was protected with iron, nor could they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprocure ladders or towers since their own had been burned. Nevertheless some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them made extemporized ladders, and others pushed trunks of trees against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls to serve in place of ladders. Still others fastened iron hooks to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tropes and hurled them up to the walls, and whenever one of them caught fast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey climbed up. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The \u0152nandians, who were neighbors of the Xanthians, and who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed an alliance with Brutus by reason of their enmity to the latter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclambered up by way of a precipice. When the Romans saw them they toiled up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter them. Many fell off, but some scaled the wall and opened a small gate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefended with a very dense palisade, and admitted the most daring of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassailants, who swung themselves over the palings. Being now more numerous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey began to chop down the portcullis, which was not protected with iron on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inside, while others outside chopped in conjunction with them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perated to the same end. While the Xanthians, with loud cries,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere rushing upon the Romans who were at the temple of Sarpedon, the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin and without who were demolishing the portcullis, fearful for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomrades, struggled with frantic zeal. Finally they broke it down and rushed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough in crowds about sunset, with a loud shout intended as a signal to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose in the temple. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the city was taken the Xanthians ran to their houses and killed those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdearest to them, all of whom willingly offered themselves to the slaughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpon hearing cries of lamentation, Brutus thought that plundering was going\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton, and he gave orders to the army to stop it; but when he knew what the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacts were he commiserated the freedom-loving spirit of the citizens, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent messengers to offer them terms. They hurled missiles at the messengers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, after destroying their own families, placed the bodies on funeral\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiles, which they had previously erected in their houses, set fire to them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand slew themselves on the same. Brutus saved such of the temples as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould, but he captured only the slaves of the Xanthians; and of the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta few free women and hardly 150 men. Thus the Xanthians perished the third\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime by their own hands on account of their love of liberty; for when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity was besieged by Harpagus, the Mede, the general of Cyrus the Great,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey destroyed themselves in like manner rather than be enslaved, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, shut up by Harpagus, then became the tomb of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Xanthians; and it is said that they suffered a similar fate at the hands\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Alexander, the son of Philip, as they would not submit to obey him even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter he had become the master of so large a portion of the earth. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus went from Xanthus down to Patara, a city which was something like a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseaport of the Xanthians. He surrounded it with his army and ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants to obey him in everything, under penalty of meeting the fate of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Xanthians. Certain Xanthians were brought to them who lamented their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmisfortunes and advised them to adopt wiser counsels. As the inhabitants of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatara made no sort of answer to the Xanthians, Brutus gave them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of the day to consider the matter, and went away. The next morning\n\t\t\t\t\t\the moved his troops forward. The Patarans cried out from the walls that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould obey all his commands, and opened their gates. He came in, but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither killed nor banished anybody; but he ordered them to deliver to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhatever gold and silver the city possessed, and each citizen to bring in\n\t\t\t\t\t\this private holdings under the same penalties and rewards to informers as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose proclaimed by Cassius at Rhodes. They obeyed his order. One slave\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttestified that his master had concealed his gold, and showed it to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturion who was sent to find it. All the parties were brought before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunal. The master remained silent, but his mother, who had followed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to save her son, cried out that she had concealed the gold. The slave,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough not interrogated, disputed her, saying that she lied and that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster had concealed it. Brutus approved of the young man's silence and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsympathized with his mother's grief. He allowed them both to depart unharmed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to take their gold with them, and he crucified the slave for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperserviceable zeal in accusing his superiors. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time Lentulus, who had been sent to Andriace, the seaport of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyreans, broke the chain which closed the harbor and ascended to Myra. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inhabitants obeyed his commands, he collected money in the same way as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Patara and returned to Brutus. The confederation of Lycia sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambassadors to Brutus promising to form a military league with him and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute what money they could. He imposed taxes on them and he restored\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe free Xanthians to their city. He ordered the Lycian fleet, together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own ships, to set sail for Abydus, where he would rendezvous with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland forces and await Cassius, who was coming from Ionia, so that they might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcross over to Sestus together. When Murcus, who was at Peloponnesus lying in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twait for Cleopatra, learned that her fleet had been damaged by a storm on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Libyan coast, and saw the wreckage borne by the waves as far as Laconia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand knew that she had returned home with difficulty and in ill health, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed for Brundusium in order that he might not be idle with so great a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet. He came to anchor at the island lying opposite the harbor, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevented the remainder of the enemy's army and supplies from passing over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Macedonia. Antony fought him with the few war-ships that he had, and with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowers mounted on floats, whenever he sent out detachments of his army on\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransports and was favored by a strong wind from the land, in order that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey might not be captured by Murcus. As he fared badly he called for help\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Octavius, who was contending on the water with Sextus Pompeius along\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coast of Sicily for possession of that island. \n\t\t\t\t"},"10":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t With Pompeius the situation was as follows. Being the younger son of Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Great, he was at first disregarded by Gaius C\u00e6sar in Spain as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot likely to accomplish anything of importance on account of his youth and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinexperience. He roamed about the ocean with a few followers, committing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiracy and concealing the fact that he was Pompeius. When larger numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined him for the purpose of pillage, and his force became powerful, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevealed his name. Presently those who had served with his father and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother, and who were leading a vagabond life, drifted to him as their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural leader, and Arabio, who had been deprived of his ancestral kingdom,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas I have related previously, came to him from Africa. His forces being thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\taugmented, his doings were now more important than robbery, and as he flew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom place to place the name of Pompeius spread through the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, which was the most extensive of the provinces; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\the avoided coming to an engagement with the governors of it appointed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaius C\u00e6sar. When C\u00e6sar learned of his doings he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarinas with a stronger army to fight him. Pompeius, however, being the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnimble of the two, would show himself and then disappear, and so he wore out\n\t\t\t\t\t\this enemy and got possession of a number of towns, large and small. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then C\u00e6sar sent Asinius Pollio as successor to Carinas to prosecute\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe war against Pompeius. While they were carrying on the same kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twarfare, C\u00e6sar was assassinated and the Senate recalled Pompeius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter came to Massilia and there watched the course of events at Rome.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving been appointed commander of the sea with the same powers that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather had exercised, he did not yet come back to the city, but, taking what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships he found in the harbors, and joining them with those he had brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Spain, he put to sea. When the triumvirate was established he sailed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, and as Bithynicus, the governor, would not yield the island, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged him, until Hirtius and Fannius, two men who had been proscribed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fled from Rome, persuaded Bithynicus to surrender Sicily to Pompeius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way Pompeius possessed himself of Sicily, and thus had ships, and an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisland lying convenient to Italy, and an army, now of considerable size,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of those whom he had before, and those who had fled from Rome, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreemen and slaves, or those sent to him by the Italian cities which had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen proclaimed as prizes of victory for the soldiers. These cities dreaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta victory of the triumvirs more than anything else, and whatever they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo against them secretly they did. The wealthy citizens fled from a country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they could no longer consider their own and took refuge with Pompeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was near by and greatly beloved by all at that time. There were present\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him also many seafaring men from Africa and Spain, skilled in naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffairs, so that Pompeius was well provided with officers, ships, troops,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand money. When Octavius learned these facts he sent Salvidienus with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet to come alongside of Pompeius and destroy him, as though it were an\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasy task, while he passed through Italy himself with the intention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoining Salvidienus at Rhegium. Pompeius advanced with a large fleet to meet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvidienus, and a naval engagement took place between them at the entrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the straits near the promontory of Scyll\u00e6um. The ships of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, being lighter and manned by better sailors, excelled in swiftness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand skill, while those of the Romans, being of great tonnage and size,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabored heavily. When the usual rush of waves through the straits came on,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the sea dashed hither and thither under the influence of the current,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ships of Pompeius suffered less than their adversaries, because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere accustomed to the agitation of the waters; while those of Salvidienus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing unable to maintain their position firmly, or to work their oars, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanage their rudders, by reason of their inexperience, were thrown into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfusion. Accordingly, about sunset, Salvidienus was the first to give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignal of retreat. Pompeius withdrew also. The ships suffered about equally\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton both sides. Salvidienus retired to the port of Balarus, facing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraits, where he repaired what was left of his damaged and wasted fleet. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius arrived he gave a solemn promise to the inhabitants of Rhegium\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Vibo that they should be exempt from the list of prizes of victory, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\the feared them on account of their nearness to the straits. As Antony had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent him a hasty summons, he set sail to join the latter at Brundusium,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving Sicily and Pompeius on his left hand; and postponing the conquest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe island for the time being. On the approach of Octavius, Murcus withdrew\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta short distance from Brundusium in order that he might not be between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and Octavius, and there he watched for the passage of the transports\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were carrying the army across from Brundusium to Macedonia. The latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere escorted by triremes, but a strong and favorable wind having sprung up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey darted across fearlessly, needing no escort. Murcus was vexed, but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlay in wait for the empty ships on their return. Yet these returned, took on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboard the remainder of the soldiers, and crossed again with full sails until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole army, together with Octavius and Antony, had passed over. Although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMurcus recognized that his plans were frustrated by some fatality, he held\n\t\t\t\t\t\this position nevertheless, in order to hinder as much as possible the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassage of the enemy's munitions and supplies, or supplementary troops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomitius Ahenobarbus was sent by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius to co\u00f6perate with him in this work, which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeemed most useful, together with fifty additional ships, one legion, and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of archers; for, as the triumvirs did not have a plentiful supply of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovisions from elsewhere, it was deemed important to cut off their convoys\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Italy. And so Murcus and Domitius, with their 130 long ships and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill greater number of small ones, and their large military force, sailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thither and thither harassing the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Decidius and Norbanus, whom Octavius and Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad sent in advance with eight legions to Macedonia, proceeded from that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry a distance of 1500 stades toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmountainous part of Thrace until they had passed beyond the city of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilippi, and seized the passes of the Corpileans and the Sap\u00e6ans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribes under the rule of Rhascupolis, where lies the only known route of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttravel from Asia to Europe. Here was the first obstacle encountered by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius after they had crossed over from Abydus to Sestus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhascupolis and Rhascus were brothers of the royal family of Thrace, ruling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone country. They differed in opinion at that time in regard to the proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\talliance. Rhascus had taken up arms for Antony and Rhascupolis for Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach having 3000 horse. When the Cassians came to inquire about the roads,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhascupolis told them that the one by way of \u00c6nus and Maronea was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe short and usual and most travelled route, but that it led to the gorge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Sap\u00e6ans, which was occupied by the enemy and hence was\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpassable, but that there was a roundabout road which was difficult and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree times as long. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus and Cassius, thinking that the enemy had taken that position not so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch to close the passage to them as to transfer themselves from Macedonia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Thrace for want of provisions, marched toward \u00c6nus and Maronea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Lysimacheia and Cardia, which clasp the neck of the Thracian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChersonesus like gates. The next day brought them to the gulf of Melas. Here they reviewed their army, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Coast of Thrace, showing the Field of Philippi \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t which contained in all nineteen legions of infantry. Of these Brutus had\n\t\t\t\t\t\teight and Cassius nine, not full, but among them were two legions that were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearly full, so that they mustered about 80,000 foot-soldiers. Brutus had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4000 Gallic and Lusitanian horse, 3000 Thracian and Illyrian, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 2000 Parthian and Thessalian. Cassius had 2000 Spanish and Gallic horse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 4000 mounted bowmen, Arabs, Medes, and Parthians. The allied kings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttetrarchs of the Galatians in Asia followed him, leading a large additional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce of foot-soldiers and about 5000 horse. \n\t\t\t\t"},"11":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was the size of the army reviewed by Brutus and Cassius at the gulf of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelas, and with it they advanced to battle, leaving the remainder of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces on duty elsewhere. After performing a lustration for the army, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompleted the payment of the promised donative still due to the soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey had provided themselves with an abundant supply of money in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropitiate them with gifts, especially the large number who had served under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaius C\u00e6sar, lest at the sight or the name of the younger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, who was advancing, they should change their minds. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich reason also it was deemed best to address the soldiers publicly. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge platform was built, upon which the generals took their places,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by the senators only. The soldiers, both their own and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallies, stood around it below, filled with joy at the sight of their vast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber, the most powerful they had ever beheld. To both the generals this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas an immediate source of the greatest hope and courage. This more than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything else confirmed the fidelity of the army to the generals, for common\n\t\t\t\t\t\thopes generate good feeling. There was a great deal of noise, as is usual on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch occasions. The heralds and trumpeters proclaimed silence, and, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis was obtained, Cassius, who was the elder of the two, advanced a little\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin front of his companions and spoke as follows:-- \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"A common peril, fellow-soldiers, is the first thing that binds us in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon fidelity to each other.

But they were not able to censure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis man openly or to bring him to trial by reason of the strength of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies, which, although heretofore belonging to the republic, he had made\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own. So they adopted the only remaining method to ward off tyranny, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was to conspire against the person of the tyrant. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It was necessary that the decision should be that of the best men, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deed should be done by a few. When it was done the Senate voiced the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral approval clearly by proposing rewards to the tyrannicides. Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrained them from doing so on the pretext that it would lead to disorder;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor was it our intention to confer this benefit upon Rome for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\t\treward, but solely for the sake of the country. Accordingly the senators\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefrained, not wishing to insult C\u00e6sar, but only to get rid of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyranny. So they voted amnesty for all, and it was more particularly decreed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there should be no prosecution for the murder. After a little, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony excited the mob against us, the Senate gave us command of the largest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces and armies, and ordered all the countries between Syria and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic to obey us. In so doing did they punish us as monsters, or did they\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather distinguish us as tyrannicides with the royal purple and with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trods and axes? For like reason the Senate recalled from exile the younger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius (who was not concerned in this conspiracy), because he was the only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Pompey the Great, who first took up arms to defend the republic, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause the young man had made some little opposition in a private way to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tyranny in Spain. It passed a decree also to pay back to him, out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic funds, the value of his father's property, and it appointed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmiral in order that he also might hold a command because he was on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the republic. What more could you ask of the Senate by way of deed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor of sign to show that everything was done with their approval, unless that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should declare it to you in so many words? But they will do and say\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis very thing, and saying it they will repay you with magnificent gifts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they are able to speak and to requite your services. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"What their present situation is you know. They have been proscribed without\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial, and their property confiscated. Without being condemned, they have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen put to death in their houses, in the streets, in temples, by soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby slaves, by personal enemies. They have been dragged out of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thiding-places and pursued everywhere, although the laws allow anybody to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto voluntary exile. In the forum, where the head of an enemy was never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried, but only captured arms and the beaks of ships, the heads of those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were lately consuls, pr\u00e6tors, tribunes, \u00e6diles, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights have been exhibited. Rewards have been assigned for these horrors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a breaking out of all the wounds that had been previously healed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover, -- sudden seizures of men, and all kinds of infamy perpetrated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twives and sons, freedmen and slaves. Into so desperate a plight and such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions has the city now been plunged. At the head of all these villains\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the triumvirs, who proscribe their own brothers and uncles and tutors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst of all. It is said that the city was once captured by the most savage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbarbarians, but the Gauls never cut off any heads, they never insulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, they never begrudged their enemies a chance to hide or fly. Nor did we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tever treat in this way any city that we had captured in war, nor did we ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\thear of others doing so. Moreover, it is no ordinary city, but the mistress\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the world, that is thus wronged by those who have been chosen to set in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder and regulate the republic. What did Tarquin ever do like this, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTarquin, whom our ancestors hurled from the throne for an outrage committed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon one woman under the influence of the amatory passion, and then, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one act, they resolved to be ruled by kings no longer? \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"While the triumvirs are committing these outrages, O citizens, they call us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfamous wretches. They say they are avenging C\u00e6sar when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribe men who were not in Rome when he was killed. Very many of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare here, as you see, who have been proscribed on account of their wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir family, or their preferences for republican government. For this\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason Pompeius was proscribed with us, although he was far away in Spain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we did the deed. Because he was the son of a republican father (for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich reason also he was recalled by the Senate and made commander of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea), he was proscribed by the triumvirs. What part have those women had in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe conspiracy against C\u00e6sar, who have been condemned to pay\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribute? What part have those plebeians had, whose property is worth 100,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrachmas each, upon whom new taxes and contributions have been imposed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich they have been ordered to pay under penalty of being informed against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand fined? And even while levying these exactions the triumvirs have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfully paid the sums promised to their troops, while we, who have done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing contrary to justice, have given you all that we promised and have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother funds ready for still larger rewards. So it comes about that the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavor us because we do what is just. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Besides the favor of the gods you can see that we have that of mankind by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooking at these, your fellow-citizens, whom you have often beheld as your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals and your consuls, and who have won your praises as such. You see\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they have had recourse to us as to men doing right and defending the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepublic. They espouse our cause, they offer up their prayers, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tco\u00f6perate with us for what still remains to be done. Far more just\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the rewards we have offered to those who rescue them than those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe triumvirs offer for killing them. The triumvirs know that we, who killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar because he assumed the monarchy, would not tolerate them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassuming his power and that we would not assume it ourselves, but that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould restore to the people in common the government as we received it from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour ancestors. So you see the two sides have not taken up arms for the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason, -- the enemy aiming at monarchy and despotism, as their proscription\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready proves, while we seek nothing but the mere privilege of living as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate citizens under the laws of our country made once more free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNaturally the men before you espouse our side as the gods had done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously.

How far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperior we are to the enemy in everything that the human foresight of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals can provide let me tell you. We are equal to them in the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, although we have left behind us the large detachments needed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany places. In cavalry and ships we greatly surpass them, as also in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauxiliaries from kings and nations as far as the Medes and Parthians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides this we have to deal only with an enemy in front, while Pompeius is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcooperating with us in Sicily in their rear, and in the Adriatic Murcus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAhenobarbus with a large fleet and abundance of small craft, besides two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions of soldiers and a body of archers, are cruising hither and thither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharassing them in various ways, while both land and sea in our rear are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcleared of enemies. As regards money, which some call the sinews of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twar, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare destitute. They cannot pay what they have promised their army. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeds of the proscription have not met their expectation, because no good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman will buy lands entailed with hate. Nor can they obtain resources\n\t\t\t\t\t\telsewhere from Italy, exhausted as it is by civil strife, exactions, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscriptions. Thanks to abundant foresight, we have plenty for the present,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that we can give you more shortly, and there are other large sums on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad collected from the nations behind us. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Provisions, the supply of which is the chief difficulty in large armies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey can obtain only from Macedonia, a mountainous region, and the narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry of Thessaly, and this must be carried to them overland with severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabor. If they try to obtain any from Africa, or Lucania, or Apulia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, Murcus, and Domitius will cut them off entirely. We have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabundance, and it is brought to us daily by sea without labor from all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tislands and mainlands which lie between Thrace and the river Euphrates, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout hindrance, since we have no enemy in our rear. So it rests with us\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither to hasten the battle, or by delaying it to waste the enemy by hunger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSuch and so great, fellow-soldiers, are our preparations, so far as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepend on human foresight.

And now, to increase\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe zeal with which you already advance to your task, and in remembrance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis assembly and of these words, we will make an additional gift from this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplatform -- to each soldier 1500 Italic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrachmas, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach centurion five times that sum, and to each tribune in proportion.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having thus spoken and having put his army in good spirits by deed and word\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand gifts, he dissolved the assembly. The soldiers remained a long time\n\t\t\t\t\t\theaping praises on Cassius and Brutus and promising to do their duty. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals immediately counted out the money to them, and to the bravest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tawarded an additional sum on various pretexts. As they received their pay\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were dismissed by detachments on the march to Doriscus, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals themselves followed soon afterward. Two eagles alighted upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo silver eagles which surmounted the standards, pecking at them, or, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers say, protecting them, and there they remained, being fed by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals from the public stores until the day before the battle, when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflew away. After marching two days around the gulf of Melas the army came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00c6nus and thence to Doriscus and other towns on the coast as far as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMount Serrium. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"12":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As Mount Serrium projected into the sea Cassius and Brutus turned to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainland, but they sent Tillius Cimber with the fleet and one legion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops and some archers to sail around the promontory, which, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfertile, was formerly deserted because the Thracians were not accustomed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea and avoided the coast for fear of pirates. So the Chalcideans and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother Greeks took possession of it, being seafaring people, and caused it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflourish with commerce and agriculture, and the Thracians were much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgratified by the opportunity for the exchange of products. Finally Philip,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe son of Amyntas, drove out the Chalcideans and other Greeks so that no\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraces of them were to be seen except the ruins of their temples. Tillius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed along this promontory, again deserted, as he had been ordered to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Cassius and Brutus, measuring and mapping places suitable for camps, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching it with his ships now and then in order that the forces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorbanus might abandon the pass, under the belief that it was useless to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold it longer. And it turned out as he had anticipated, for on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearance of the ships Norbanus became alarmed for the Sap\u00e6an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpass and called on Decidius to hasten from that of the Corpileans to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance, which he did. As soon as the latter pass was abandoned Brutus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Cassius marched through it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the stratagem became manifest Norbanus and Decidius occupied the gorge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Sap\u00e6ans strongly. Again Brutus and Cassius could find no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassage. They fell into discouragement lest they should now have to begin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe roundabout journey which they had disdained, and to turn upon their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttracks, although pressed by time and the lateness of the season. While they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in this mood Rhascupolis said that there was a circuitous route (along\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very side of the Sap\u00e6an mountain) of three days' march, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been impassable to men up to this time on account of rocks, scarcity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater, and dense forests. If they would carry their water and make a narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut sufficient pathway, they would be so enveloped in shade that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be perceived even by birds. On the fourth day they would come to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver Harpessus, which falls into the Hebrus, and in one day more they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe at Philippi, flanking the enemy so as to cut him off completely and leave\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim no chance to retreat. They adopted this plan since there was nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse to do, and especially because it held out the hope of surrounding so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge a force of the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t They sent a detachment in advance under command of Lucius Bibulus, in company\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Rhascupolis, to cut a path. They found it a very laborious task, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey accomplished it nevertheless with enthusiastic zeal, and all the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen some who had gone ahead came back and said that they had had a distant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of the river. On the fourth day, fatigued with labor and thirst, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater which they carried being nearly exhausted, they recollected that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been said that they should be in a waterless region only three days. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey fell into a panic, fearing that they were the victims of a stratagem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey did not disbelieve those who had been sent in advance and who said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had seen the river, but they thought that they themselves had been led\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a different direction. They lost heart and cried aloud, and when they saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhascupolis riding by and exhorting them to have courage, they reviled him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand threw stones at him. While Bibulus was beseeching them with words of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood cheer to persevere to the end, towards evening the river was seen by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose in front, who, as was natural, raised a cry of joy, which was taken up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby those behind in due order until it reached the rear. When Brutus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius learned this they hurried forward at once, leading on the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their army through the pathway that had been cleared. Nevertheless, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not conceal their doings from the enemy altogether, nor surround them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Rhascus, the brother of Rhascupolis, having his suspicions aroused by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe shouting, made a reconnoissance; and when he saw what was being done he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas astonished at so large an army traversing a pathway where no water could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe obtained, and where he thought not even a wild beast could penetrate by\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason of the dense foliage, and he forthwith communicated the news to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy of Norbanus. The latter retreated by night from the gorge of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSap\u00e6ans toward Amphipolis. Each of the Thracian brothers received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan ovation in his own army, the one because he had led an army by an unknown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpath, the other because he had discovered the movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus Brutus and Cassius by an astounding act of audacity advanced to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilippi, where Tillius also disembarked, and the whole army was there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembled. Philippi is a city that was formerly called Datus, and before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Crenides, because there are many springs bubbling around a hill there. Philip fortified it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he considered it an excellent stronghold against the Thracians, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnamed it from himself, Philippi. It is situated on a precipitous hill and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits size is exactly that of the summit of the hill. There are woods on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth through which Rhascupolis led the army of Brutus and Cassius. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth is a marsh extending to the sea. On the east are the gorges of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSap\u00e6ans and Corpileans, and on the west a very fertile and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeautiful plain extending to the towns of Murcinus and Drabiscus and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver Strymon, about 350 stades. Here it is said that Cora was carried off\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile gathering flowers, and here is the river Zygactes, in crossing which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey say that the yoke of the god's chariot was broken, from which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstance the river received its name. The plain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslopes downward so that movement is easy to those descending from Philippi,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut toilsome to those going up from Amphipolis. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There is another hill not far from Philippi which is called the Hill of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDionysus, in which are gold mines called the Asyla. Ten stades farther are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo other hills, at a distance of eighteen stades from Philippi itself and\n\t\t\t\t\t\teight stades from each other. On these hills Cassius and Brutus were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped, the former on the southern and the latter on the northern of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo. They did not advance against the retreating army of Norbanus because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey learned that Antony was approaching, Octavius having been left behind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Epidamnus on account of sickness. The plain was admirably situated for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfighting and the precipitous hill-tops for camping, since on one side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem were marshes and ponds stretching as far as the river Strymon, and on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other gorges destitute of roads and impassable. Between these hills,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teight stades apart, lay the main pass from Europe to Asia as between gates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcross this space they built a fortification from camp to camp, leaving a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgate in the middle, so that the two camps became virtually one. Alongside\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis fortification flowed a river, which is called by some the Ganga and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers the Gangites, and behind it was the sea, where they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeep their supplies and shipping in safety. Their depot was on the island of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThasos, 100 stades distant. Their triremes were anchored at Neapolis, at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance of seventy stades. Brutus and Cassius were satisfied with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition and they proceeded to fortify their camps. \n\t\t\t\t"},"13":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony moved his army rapidly, wishing to anticipate the enemy in occupying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmphipolis as an advantageous position for the battle. When he found it\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready fortified by Norbanus he was delighted. Leaving his apparatus there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand one legion, under the command of Pinarius, he advanced with the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldness and encamped in the plain at a distance of only eight stades from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy, and straightway the superiority of the enemy's situation and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinferiority of his own became evident. The former were on elevated ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter on the plain; the former procured fuel from the mountains, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter from the marshes; the former obtained water from a river, the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom wells freshly dug; the former drew their supplies from Thasos,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequiring carriage of only a few stades, while the latter was 350\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstades from Amphipolis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStill it seems that Antony was compelled to do as he did, for there was no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother hill, and the rest of the plain, lying in a sort of hollow, was liable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto inundation at times from the river; for which reason also the fountains\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof water were found fresh and abundant in the wells that were dug there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's audacity, although he was driven to it by necessity, confounded the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy when they saw him pitch his camp so near them and in such a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontemptuous manner as soon as he arrived. He raised numerous towers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortified himself on all sides with ditch, wall, and palisade. The enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso completed their fortification wherever the work was defective. Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserving that Antony's advance was reckless, extended his fortification at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only place where it was still wanting, from the camp to the marsh, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspace which had been overlooked on account of its narrowness, so that there\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now nothing unfortified except the cliffs on Brutus's flank and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarsh on that of Cassius and the sea lying against the marsh. In the centre\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything was intercepted by ditch, palisade, wall, and gates. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way both sides had fortified themselves, in the meantime making trial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof each other by cavalry skirmishes only. When they had done all that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintended and Octavius had arrived (for, although he was not yet strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenough for a battle, he could be carried along the ranks reclining in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlitter), he and Antony prepared for battle forthwith. Brutus and Cassius\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso drew out their forces on their higher ground, but did not come down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey decided not to give battle, hoping to wear out the enemy by want of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies. There were nineteen legions of infantry on each side, but those of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius lacked something of being full, while those of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Antony were complete. Of cavalry the latter had 13,000 and the former\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20,000, including Thracians on both sides. Thus in the multitude of men, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit and bravery of the commanders, and in arms and munitions, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeheld a most magnificent display on both sides; yet they did nothing for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral days. Brutus and Cassius did not wish to engage, but rather to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue wasting the enemy by lack of provisions, since they themselves had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabundance from Asia, all transported by the sea from close at hand, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy had nothing in abundance and nothing from their own territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey could obtain nothing through merchants from Egypt, since that country\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas exhausted by famine, nor from Spain or Africa by reason of Pompeius, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Italy by reason of Murcus and Domitius. Macedonia and Thessaly, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the only countries then supplying them, would not suffice much longer. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Mindful chiefly of these facts Brutus and Cassius protracted the war. Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearful of the same, resolved to force them to an engagement. He formed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplan of effecting a passage through the marsh secretly, if possible, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to get in the enemy's rear without their knowledge, and cut off their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenue of supply from Thasos. So he arrayed his forces for battle with all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe standards set each day, so that it might seem that his entire army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrawn up, while a part of his force was really working night and day cutting\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta narrow passage in the marsh, cutting down reeds, throwing up a causeway\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand flanking it with stone so that the earth should not fall away, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbridging the deeper parts with piles, all in the profoundest silence. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\treeds, which were still growing around his passage-way, prevented the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom seeing his work. After working ten days in this manner he sent a column\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof troops by night suddenly, who occupied all the strong positions inside\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand built several redoubts at the same time. Cassius was amazed at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingenuity as well as the secrecy of this work, and he formed the counter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign of cutting Antony off from his redoubts. He carried a transverse wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross the whole marsh from his camp to the sea, cutting and bridging in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame manner as Antony had done, and laying a solid foundation for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\trampart, thus intercepting the passage sage made by Antony, so that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinside could not escape to him, nor he render assistance to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony saw this about noon, instantly, with rage and fury, he turned his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town army, which was facing in another direction, and led it against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification of Cassius which lay between his camp and the marsh. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried tools and ladders intending to take it by storm and force his way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto Cassius' camp. While he was making this audacious charge, obliquely and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup hill, across the space that separated the two armies, the soldiers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus were provoked at the insolence of the enemy in dashing boldly athwart\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir front while they stood there armed. So they charged of their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolition, without any order from their officers, took them in flank, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled as many as they could reach. The battle once begun they charged upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army of Octavius, also, which was drawn up opposite, put it to flight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued it to the camp which Antony and Octavius had in common, and captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit. Octavius himself was not there, having been warned in a dream to beware\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof that day, as he has himself written in his Memoirs. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony saw that battle was joined he was delighted because he had forced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, for he had been in trouble about his supplies. He judged it inadvisable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto turn again toward the plain, lest in making the evolution his ranks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be thrown into disorder. So he continued his charge, as he had begun\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, on the run, and advanced under a shower of missiles, and forced his way\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttill he struck a body of Cassius' troops, which had not moved from its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned position and which was amazed at this unexpected audacity. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourageously broke this advance guard and dashed against the fortification\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat ran between the marsh and the camp, demolished the palisade, filled up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ditch, undermined the works, and killed the men at the gates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarding the missiles hurled from the wall, until he had forced an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance through the gates, and others had made breaches in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification, and still others had climbed up on the debris. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis was done so swiftly that those who had just now captured the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification met Cassius' men, who had been at work in the marsh, coming to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe assistance of their friends, and, with a powerful charge, put them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight, drove them into the marsh, and then at once wheeled against the camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Cassius itself. These were only the men who had scaled the fortification\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Antony, the remainder being engaged in conflict with the enemy on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother side of the wall. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As the camp was in a strong position it was guarded by only a few men, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich reason Antony easily overcame them. Cassius' soldiers outside the camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere already worsted, and when they saw that the camp was taken they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscattered in disorderly flight. The victory was complete and alike on either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside, Brutus defeating the enemy's left wing and taking their camp, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony overcame Cassius and ravaged his camp with irresistible courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was great slaughter on both sides, but by reason of the extent of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplain and the clouds of dust they were ignorant of each other's fate. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey learned the facts they recalled their scattered forces. Those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned resembled porters rather than soldiers, and did not at once\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperceive each other nor see anything clearly. Otherwise either party would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave flung down their burdens and fiercely attacked the others carrying off\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplunder in this disorderly fashion. According to conjecture the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled on the side of Cassius, including slave shield-bearers, was about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8000 and on the side of Octavius double that number. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"},"14":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Cassius was driven out of his fortifications and no longer had any camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto go to, he ascended the hill to Philippi and took a survey of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituation. He could not see accurately on account of the dust, nor could he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsee everything, but upon discovering that his own camp was captured he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered Pindarus, his shield-bearer, to draw his sword and kill him. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPindarus delayed a messenger ran up and said that Brutus had been victorious\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the other wing and was ravaging the enemy's camp. Cassius merely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered, \"Tell him that I pray his victory may be complete.\" Then, turning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pindarus, he said, \"What are you waiting for? Why do you not deliver me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom my shame?\" Then, as he presented his throat, Pindarus slew him. This is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone account of the death of Cassius. Others say that as some horsemen were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching, bringing the good news from Brutus, he took them for enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sent Titinius to find out exactly; that the horsemen pressed around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitinius joyfully as a friend of Cassius, and at the same time uttered loud\n\t\t\t\t\t\thurrahs; that Cassius, thinking that Titinius had fallen into the hands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, said, \"Have I waited to see my friend torn from me?\" and that then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the withdrew to a tent with Pindarus, and Pindarus was never seen afterward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor this reason some persons think that he killed Cassius without orders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius ended his life on his birthday, on which also the battle was fought,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Titinius killed himself because he had been too slow. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus wept over the dead body of Cassius and called him the last of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, meaning that his equal in virtue would never exist again. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached him for haste and precipitancy, but at the same time he esteemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim happy because he was freed from cares and troubles, \"which,\" he said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"are leading Brutus, ah, whither?\" He delivered the corpse to friends to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburied secretly lest the army should be moved to tears at the sight; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself passed the whole night, without food and without care for his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson, restoring order in Cassius' army. In the morning the enemy drew up\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir army in order of battle, so that they might not seem to have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeaten. Brutus, perceiving their design, exclaimed, \"Let us arm also and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake believe that we have suffered no defeat.\" So he put his forces in line,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the enemy withdrew. Brutus said to his friends, jeeringly, \"They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenged us when they thought we were tired, but they dared not put us to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe test.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day that witnessed the battle of Philippi another great calamity\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook place in the Adriatic. Domitius Calvinus was bringing two legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfantry on transport ships to Octavius, one of which was known as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMartian legion, a name which had been given to it as a distinction for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbravery. He led also a pr\u00e6torian cohort of about 2000 men, four\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsquadrons of horse, and a considerable corps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\td'elite of other troops, under the convoy of a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes. Murcus and Ahenobarbus met them with 130 war-ships. A few of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransports that were in front got away under sail. The wind suddenly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfailing, the rest floated about in a dead calm on the sea, having been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered by some god into the hands of their enemies. The latter, without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger to themselves, fell upon each ship and crushed it; nor could the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes that escorted them render any aid, since they were hemmed in by\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason of their small number. The men who were exposed to this danger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed many deeds of valor. They hastily lashed their ships together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tropes and spars to prevent the enemy from breaking through their line. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they succeeded in doing this Murcus discharged burning arrows at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen they cast off their fastenings as quickly as possible and separated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom each other on account count of the fire, and thus again were exposed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing surrounded or rammed by the triremes. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of the soldiers, and especially the Martians, who excelled in bravery,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere exasperated that they should lose their lives uselessly, and so killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves rather than be burned to death; others leaped on board the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes of the enemy, giving and receiving blows. Vessels half burned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfloated a long time, containing men perishing by fire, by hunger, and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst. Others, clinging to masts or planks, were thrown upon barren rocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor promontories, and of these some were saved unexpectedly. Some of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere nourished for five days by licking pitch, or chewing sails or ropes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil the waves bore them to the land. The greater part, vanquished by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmisfortunes, surrendered to the enemy. Seventeen triremes surrendered, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe men in them took the oath to Murcus. Their general, Calvinus, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved to have perished, returned to Brundusium on his ship five days\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater. Such was the catastrophe that befell in the Adriatic on the same day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the battle of Philippi was fought, whether it be more fitly called a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshipwreck or a naval engagement. The coincidence of the two battles caused\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamazement when it became known later. \n\t\t\t\t"},"15":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus assembled his army and addressed it as follows: \"In yesterday's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement, fellow-soldiers, you were in every respect superior to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy. You began the battle eagerly, although without orders, and you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutterly destroyed their far-famed fourth legion, on which their wing placed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits reliance, and all those supporting it as far as their camp, and you took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand plundered their camp first, so that our victory far outweighs the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster on our left wing. When it was in your power to finish the whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork, you chose rather to plunder than to kill the vanquished. Most of you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed by the enemy and made a rush for his property. We are the superior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain in this, that of our two camps they captured only one, while we took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of theirs, so that here our gain is twice as great as our loss.

They can obtain nothing from Sicily,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSardinia, Africa, or Spain, because Pompeius, Murcus, and Ahenobarbus with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t260 ships close the sea against them.

Brutus had a part of his army in line lest he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe compelled to fight; and with another part he guarded the road by which\n\t\t\t\t\t\this supplies were conveyed. There was a hill very near the camp of Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich it was difficult for an enemy to occupy because, by reason of its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearness, it was exposed to arrows from the camp. Nevertheless, Cassius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaced a guard on it, lest it should be forced unexpectedly. As it had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoned by Brutus, the army of Octavius occupied it by night with four\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions and protected themselves with wickerwork and hides against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's bowmen. When this position was secured they transferred ten other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions a distance of more than five stades toward the sea. Four stades\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfarther they placed two legions, in order to extend themselves in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner quite to the sea, with a view of breaking through the enemy's line\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither along the sea itself, or through the marsh, or in some other way, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto cut off their supplies. Brutus counteracted this movement by building\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortified posts opposite their camps and in other ways. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The task of Octavius and Antony became pressing, hunger was already felt, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear fell upon them more and more each day, for Thessaly could no longer furnish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient supplies, nor could they hope for anything from the sea, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas commanded by the enemy everywhere. News of their recent disaster in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic having now reached both armies, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaused them fresh alarm, as also did the approach of winter while they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquartered in this muddy plain. Moved by these considerations they sent a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegion of troops to Achaia to collect all the food they could find and send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit to them in haste. As they could not rest under so great an impending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger, and as their other artifices were of no avail, they ceased offering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle in the plain and advanced with shouts to the enemy's fortifications,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand challenged Brutus to fight, reviling and scoffing at him, intending not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso much to besiege him as by a mad rush to bring him to an engagement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his will. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus adhered to his original intention, and all the more because he knew of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe famine and of his own success in the Adriatic, and of the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesperation for want of supplies. He preferred to endure a siege, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything else, rather than come to an engagement with men who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamishing, and whose hopes rested solely on fighting because they despaired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof every other resource. His soldiers, however, without reflection,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentertained a different opinion. They took it hard that they should be shut\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup, idle and cowardly, like women, within their fortifications. Their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers, although they approved of Brutus' design, were vexed, thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat in the present temper of the army they might overpower the enemy more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly. Brutus himself was the cause of these murmurs, being of a gentle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand kindly disposition toward all -- not like Cassius, who was austere and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timperious in every way, for which reason the army obeyed his orders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromptly, not interfering with his authority, not inquiring the reasons for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this orders, and not criticising them when they had learned them. But in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase of Brutus they expected nothing else than to share the command with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton account of his mildness of temper. Finally, the soldiers began openly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect together in companies and groups and to ask each other, \"Why does\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour general put a stigma upon us? How have we offended lately -- we who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquered the enemy and put him to flight; we who slaughtered those opposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto us and took their camp?\" Brutus took no notice of these murmurs, nor did\n\t\t\t\t\t\the call an assembly, lest he should be forced from his position, contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this dignity, by the unreasoning multitude, and especially by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmercenaries, who, like fickle slaves seeking new masters, always rest their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thopes of safety on desertion to the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t His officers kept teasing and urging him to make use of the eagerness of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy now, which would speedily bring glorious results. If the battle should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturn out adversely, they could fall back to their walls and put the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortifications between themselves and the enemy. Brutus was especially vexed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith these, for they were his officers, and he grieved that they, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to the same peril as himself, should capriciously side with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers in preferring a quick and doubtful chance to a victory without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger; but, to the ruin of himself and them, he yielded, chiding them with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words, \"I seem to be carrying on war like Pompey the Great, not so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch commanding as commanded.\" I think that Brutus restricted himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words in order to conceal his greatest fear, lest those of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers who had formerly served under C\u00e6sar should become\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaffected and desert to the enemy. This both himself and Cassius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehended from the beginning, and they had been careful not to give any\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcuse for such disaffection toward themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So Brutus led out his army unwillingly and formed them in line of battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore his walls, ordering them not to advance very far from the hill so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they might have a safe retreat if necessary and a good position for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thurling darts at the enemy. In each army the men exchanged exhortations with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other. There was great eagerness for battle, and unbounded confidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the one side was the fear of famine, on the other a well-deserved shame\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they had constrained their general to fight when he still favored\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelay, and fear lest they should come short of their promises and prove\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker than their boastings, and expose themselves to the charge of rashness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of winning praise for good counsel; because also Brutus, riding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the ranks on horseback, showed himself before them with a severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountenance and reminded them in a few words of what the opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffered. \"You want to fight,\" he said; \"you force me to battle when I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\table to conquer otherwise. Do not falsify\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy hopes or your own. You have the advantage of the higher ground and\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything safe in your rear. The enemy's position is the one of peril\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he lies between you and famine.\" With these words he passed on, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers telling him to trust them and echoing his words with shouts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius and Antony rode through their own ranks shaking hands with those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearest them, and urging them in the most serious manner to do their duty,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand not concealing the danger of famine, because they believed that that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be the greatest incitement to bravery. \"Soldiers,\" they said, \"we have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound the enemy. We have before us those whom we sought to catch outside of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir fortifications. Let none of you shame his own challenge or prove\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunequal to his own threat. Let no one prefer hunger, that unmanageable and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistressing evil, to the walls and bodies of the enemy which they will yield\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto bravery, to the sword, to despair. Our situation at this moment is so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressing that nothing can be postponed till to-morrow, but this very day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust decide for us either a complete victory or an honorable death. If we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquer we gain in one day and by one blow provisions, money, ships, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamps, and the prizes of victory offered by ourselves. Such will be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult if, from our first onset upon them, we are mindful of the necessity\n\t\t\t\t\t\turging us on, and if, after breaking their ranks, we immediately cut them\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff from their gates and drive them upon the rocks or into the plain, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the war may not spring up again or these enemies get away for another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of idleness -- the only warriors who are so weak as to rest their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thopes, not on fighting, but on declining to fight.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way Octavius and Antony roused the spirit of those with whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame in contact. The emulation of the troops was excited to show themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworthy of their commanders and also to escape the danger of famine, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been greatly augmented by the naval disaster in the Adriatic. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred, if necessary, to suffer in battle, with the hope of success,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than be wasted by an irresistible foe. Inspired by these thoughts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich each man exchanged with his nearest neighbor, the spirit of the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies was wonderfully raised and both were filled with undaunted courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey did not now remember that they were fellow-citizens of their enemies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut hurled threats at each other as though they had been enemies by birth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand descent, so much did the anger of the moment extinguish reason and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnature in them. Both sides divined equally that this day and this battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould decide the fate of Rome completely; and it did decide it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The day was consumed in preparations till the ninth hour, at which time two eagles fell upon each other and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought in the space between the armies, amid the profoundest silence. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one on the side of Brutus took flight his enemies raised a great shout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand battle was joined. The onset was superb and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterrible. They had little need of arrows, stones, or javelins, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary in war, for they did not resort to the usual man\u0153uvres\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand tactics of battles, but, coming to close combat with naked swords, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslew and were slain, seeking to break each other's ranks. On the one side it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a fight for self-preservation rather than victory; on the other for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory and for the satisfaction of the general who had been forced to fight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his will. The slaughter and the groans were terrible. The bodies of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fallen were carried back and others stepped into their places from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trear ranks. The generals flew hither and thither overlooking everything,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting the men by their ardor, exhorting the toilers to toil on, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelieving those who were exhausted so that there was always fresh courage at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe front. Finally, the soldiers of Octavius, either from fear of famine, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the good fortune of Octavius himself (for the soldiers of Brutus were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblameworthy), pushed back the enemy's line as though they were putting in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotion a very heavy machine. The latter were driven back step by step,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowly at first and without loss of courage. Presently their ranks began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolve and they retreated more rapidly, and then the second and third\n\t\t\t\t\t\tranks in the rear retreated with them, all mingled together in disorder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowded by each other and by the enemy, who pressed upon them without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tceasing until it became plainly a flight. The soldiers of Octavius, then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially mindful of the order they had received, seized the gates of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's fortification, but at great risk to themselves because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to missiles from above and in front, but they prevented a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the enemy from gaining entrance. These fled, some to the sea, and some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the river Zygactes to the mountains. \n\t\t\t\t\t","12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemy having been routed, the generals divided the remainder of the work\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween themselves, Octavius to capture those who should break out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp and to watch the main camp, while Antony was everywhere, and everywhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacking, falling upon the fugitives and those who still held together, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon their other camping-places, crushing all with vehement impetuosity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFearing lest the leaders should escape him and collect another army, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespatched cavalry upon the roads and outlets of the field of battle to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapture those who were trying to escape. These divided their work; some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem hurried up the mountain with Rhascus, the Thracian, who was sent with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem on account of his knowledge of the roads. They surrounded the fortified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositions and escarpments, hunted down the fugitives, and kept watch upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose inside. Others pursued Brutus himself. Lucilius seeing them rushing on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuriously, surrendered himself, pretending to be Brutus, and asked them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake him to Antony instead of Octavius; for which reason chiefly he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved to be Brutus trying to avoid his implacable enemy. When Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard that they were bringing him, he went to meet him, with a pause to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflect on the fortune, the dignity, and the virtue of the man, and thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow he should receive Brutus. As he was approaching, Lucilius presented\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, and said with perfect boldness, \"You have not captured Brutus, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill virtue ever be taken prisoner by vice. I deceived these men and so here\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am.\" Antony, observing that the horse-men were ashamed of their mistake,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsoled them, saying, \"The game you have caught for me is not worse, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter than you think -- as much better as a friend is than an enemy.\" Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the committed Lucilius to the care of one of his friends, and later took him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto his own service and employed him in a confidential capacity. \n\t\t\t\t"},"16":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus fled to the mountains with a considerable force, intending to return\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his camp by night, or to move down to the sea. But since all the roads\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere encompassed by guards he passed the night under arms with all his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty, and it is said that, looking up to the stars, he exclaimed: --\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \"Forget not, Zeus, the author of these ills,\" \n\t\t\t\t\t referring to Antony. It is said that Antony himself repeated this saying at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater period in the midst of his own dangers, regretting that, when he might\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave associated himself with Cassius and Brutus, he had become the tool of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. At the present time, however, Antony passed the night under arms\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his outposts over against Brutus, fortifying himself with a breastwork\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof dead bodies and spoils collected together. Octavius toiled till midnight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then retired on account of his illness, leaving Norbanus to watch the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's camp. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t On the following day Brutus, seeing the enemy still lying in wait for him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand having less than four full legions, which had ascended the mountain with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, thought it best not to address himself to his troops, but to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers, who were ashamed and repentant of their fault. To them he sent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput them to the test and to learn whether they were willing to break through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy's lines and regain their own camp, which was still held by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops who had been left there. These officers, though they had rushed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle unadvisedly, had been of good courage for the most part, but now,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmisled by a god, gave to their general the undeserved answer that he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlook out for himself, that they had tempted fortune many times, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would not throw away the last remaining hope of accommodation. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus said to his friends, \"I am no longer useful to my country if such is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe temper of these men,\" and calling Strato, the Epirote, who was one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this friends, gave him the order to stab him. While Strato was still willing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto deliberate, Brutus called one of his servants. Then Strato said, \"Your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriend shall not come short of your servants in executing your last\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands, if the decision is actually reached.\" With these words he thrust\n\t\t\t\t\t\this sword into the side of Brutus, who did not shrink or turn away. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So died Cassius and Brutus, two most noble and illustrious Romans, and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincomparable virtue, but for one crime. Although they belonged to the party\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Pompey the Great, and had been the enemies, in peace and in war, of Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, he made them his friends, and from being friends he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreating them as sons. The Senate at all times had a peculiar attachment to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, and commiseration for them when they fell into misfortune. On account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those two it granted amnesty to all the assassins, and when they took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight it bestowed governorships on them in order that they should not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\texiles; not that it was disregardful of Gaius C\u00e6sar or rejoiced at\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat had happened to him, for it admired his bravery and good fortune, gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim a public funeral at his death, ratified his acts, and had for a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime awarded the magistracies and governorships to his nominees, considering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nothing better could be devised than what he proposed. But its zeal for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese two men and its solicitude for them brought it under suspicion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplicity in the assassination, -- so much were those two held in honor by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall. By the most illustrious of the exiles they were preferred to [Sextus]\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, although he was nearer and not implacable to the triumvirs, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were farther away and irreconcilable. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When it became necessary for them to take up arms, two whole years had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\telapsed ere they had brought together upward of twenty legions of infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand something like 20,000 cavalry, and 200 ships of war, with corresponding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparatus and a vast amount of money, some of it from willing and some from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunwilling contributors. They carried on wars with many peoples and with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities and with men of the adverse faction successfully. They brought under\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir sway all the nations from Macedonia to the Euphrates. Those whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fought against they had brought into alliance with them and had found\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem most faithful. They had had the services of the independent kings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinces, and in some small measure even of the Parthians, who were enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Romans; but they did not wait for them to come and take part in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecisive battle, lest this barbarous and hostile race should become\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccustomed to encounters with the Romans. Most extraordinary of all was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that the greater part of their army had been the soldiers of Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar and wonderfully attached to him, yet they were won over by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very murderers of C\u00e6sar and followed them more faithfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst C\u00e6sar's son than they had followed Antony, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar's companion in arms and colleague; for not one of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserted Brutus and Cassius even when they were vanquished, while some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem had abandoned Antony at Brundusium before the war began. The reason for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir service, both under Pompey aforetime and now under Brutus and Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not their own interest, but the cause of democracy; a specious name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindeed, but generally hurtful. Both of the leaders, when they thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey could no longer be useful to their country, alike despised their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlives. In that which related to their cares and labors Cassius gave his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention strictly to war, like a gladiator to his antagonist. Brutus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever he might be, wanted to see and hear everything because he was by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnature a seeker after knowledge. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Against all these virtues and merits must be set down the crime against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, which was not an ordinary or a small one, for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitted unexpectedly against a friend, ungratefully against a benefactor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had spared them in war, and nefariously against the head of the state,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the senate-house, against a pontiff clothed in his sacred vestments,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst a ruler without an equal, who was most useful above all other men to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome and its empire. For these reasons Heaven was incensed against them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\toften forewarned them of their doom. When Cassius was performing a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlustration for his army his lictor presented his garland wrong side up. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgilded statue of Victory dedicated to Cassius fell down. Many birds hovered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover his camp, but uttered no sound, and swarms\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof bees continually settled upon it. While Brutus was celebrating his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirthday at Samos it is said that in the midst of the feast, although not a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready man with such quotations, he shouted out this verse without any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent cause: -- \"A cruel fate O'ertakes me, aided by Latona's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tson.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Iliad, xvi. 849. Bryant's translation. \n\t\t\t\t\t Once when he was about to cross from Asia into Europe with his army, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was awake at night and the light was burning low, he beheld an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparition of extraordinary form standing near him, and when he boldly asked\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho of men or gods it might be, the spectre answered, \"I am thy evil genius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus. I shall appear to thee again at Philippi.\" And it is said that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid appear to him before the last battle. When the soldiers were going out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the fight an Ethiopian met them in front of the gates, and as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered this a bad omen they immediately cut him in pieces. It was due to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdivine interposition, no doubt, that Cassius gave way to despair without\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason after a drawn battle, and that Brutus was forced from his policy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twise delay to an engagement with men who were pressed by hunger, while he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself had supplies in abundance and the command of the sea, so that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalamity proceeded rather from his own troops than from the enemy. Although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had participated in many engagements, they never received any hurt in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle, but both became the slayers of themselves, as they had been of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6 sar. Such was the punishment that overtook Cassius and Brutus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony found the body of Brutus, wrapped it in his best purple garment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned it, and sent the ashes to his mother, Servilia. Brutus' army, when it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned of his death, sent envoys to Octavius and Antony and obtained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpardon, and was divided between their armies. It consisted of about 14,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen. Besides these a large number who were in garrisons surrendered. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarrisons themselves and the enemy's camp were given to the soldiers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Antony to be plundered. Of the distinguished men in Brutus'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp some perished in the battles, others killed themselves as the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals had done, others purposely continued fighting till death. Among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese men of note were Lucius Cassius, a nephew of Cassius himself, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCato, the son of Cato. The latter charged upon the enemy many times; then,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen his men began to retreat, he threw off his helmet, either that he might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe recognized, or be easily hit, or for both reasons. Labeo, a man\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenowned for learning, father of the Labeo who is still celebrated as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjurisconsult, dug a trench in his tent the size of his body, gave orders to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this slaves in reference to the remainder of his affairs, made such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements as he desired for his wife and children, and gave letters to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this domestics to carry to them. Then, taking his most faithful slave by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright hand and whirling him around, as is the Roman custom in granting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom, he handed him a sword as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned, and presented his throat. And so his tent became his tomb. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rhascus, the Thracian, brought many troops from the mountains. He asked and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived as his reward the pardon of his brother, Rhascupolis, from which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas made plain that from the beginning these Thracians had not been at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvariance with each other, but that seeing two great and hostile armies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming into conflict near their territory, they took sides in the contest in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a way that the victor might save the vanquished. Portia, the wife of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and sister of the younger Cato, when she learned that both had died\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the manner described, although very strictly watched by domestics, seized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome coals of fire that they were carrying, and swallowed them. Of the members of the nobility who escaped to Thasos some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook ship from thence, others committed themselves with the remains of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy to the judgment of Messala Corvinus and Lucius Bibulus, men of equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\trank, to do for all what they should decide to do for themselves. These came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto an arrangement with Antony and Octavius, whereby they delivered to Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton his arrival at Thasos the money and arms, besides abundant supplies and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat quantity of war material, there in store. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus did Octavius and Antony by perilous daring and by two infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagements achieve a success, the like of which was never before known; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever before had such numerous and powerful Roman armies come in conflict\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith each other. These soldiers were not enlisted from the ordinary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconscription, but were picked men. They were not new levies, but under long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrill and arrayed against each other, not against foreign or barbarous\n\t\t\t\t\t\traces. Speaking the same language and using the same tactics, being of like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscipline and power of endurance, they were for these reasons evenly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatched. Nor was there ever such fury and daring in war as here, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens contended against citizens, families against families, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-soldiers against each other. The proof of this is that, taking both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattles into the account, the number of the slain among the victors appeared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be not less [than among the vanquished]. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus the army of Antony and Octavius confirmed the prediction of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals, passing in one day and by one blow from extreme danger of famine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand fear of destruction to lavish wealth, absolute security, and glorious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory. That result came about which Antony and Octavius had predicted as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey advanced into battle. Their form of government was decided by that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday's work chiefly, and they have not gone back to democracy yet. Nor was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere any further need of similar contentions with each other, except the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrife between Antony and Octavius not long afterward, which was the last\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat took place between Romans. The events that transpired after the death\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Brutus, under Sextus Pompeius and the friends of Cassius and Brutus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescaped with the very considerable remains of their extensive war material,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not to be compared to the former in daring or in the devotion of men,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities, and armies to their leaders; nor did any of the nobility, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, nor the same glory, attend them as attended Brutus and Cassius. \n\t\t\t\t"}},"4":{"0":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t AFTER the death of Cassius and Brutus, Octavius returned to Italy. Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeded to Asia, where he met Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and succumbed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther charms at first sight. This passion brought ruin upon them and upon all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt besides. For this reason a part of this book will treat of Egypt -- a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall part, however, not worth mentioning in the title, since it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincidental to the narrative of the civil wars, which constitutes much the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger portion. Other similar civil wars took place after Cassius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus, but there was no one in command of all the forces as they had been.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe later wars were sporadic. But, finally, Sextus Pompeius, the younger son\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Pompey the Great, the last remaining leader of that faction, was slain,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas Brutus and Cassius had been, and Lepidus was deprived of his share of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirate, and the whole government of the Romans was centred in two only,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and Octavius. These events came about in the following manner. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cassius, surnamed Parmesius, had been left by Cassius and Brutus in Asia with a fleet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand an army to collect money. After the death of Cassius, not anticipating\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe like fate of Brutus, he selected thirty ships belonging to the Rhodians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he intended to man, and burned the rest, except the sacred one, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they might not be able to revolt. Having done this he took his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparture with his own ships and the thirty. Clodius, who had been sent by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus to Rhodes with thirteen ships, found the Rhodians in revolt (for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus also was now dead). Clodius took away the garrison, consisting of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3000 soldiers, and joined Parmesius. They were joined by Turulius, who had a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumerous fleet and a large sum of money which he had previously extorted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Rhodes. To this fleet, which was now quite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerful, flocked those who were rendering service in various parts of Asia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand they manned the ships with soldiers as well as they could, and with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves, prisoners, and inhabitants of the islands where they touched, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\trowers. The son of Cicero joined them, and others of the nobility who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescaped from Thasos. Thus in a short time there was a considerable gathering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand organization of officers, soldiers, and ships. Having received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional forces under Lepidus, who had brought Crete under subjection to Brutus, they made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsail to the Adriatic and united with Murcus and Domitius Ahenobarbus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a large force under their command. Some of these sailed with Murcus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily to join Sextus Pompeius. The rest remained with Ahenobarbus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed a faction by themselves. Such was the first reassembling of what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained of the war preparations of Cassius and Brutus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After the battle of Philippi Octavius and Antony offered a magnificent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice and awarded praise to their army. In order to provide the rewards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof victory Octavius went to Italy to divide the land among the soldiers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto settle the colonies. He was chosen for this purpose on account of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillness. Antony went to the nations beyond the \u00c6gean to collect\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe money that had been promised to the soldiers. They divided the provinces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong themselves as before and took those of Lepidus besides. It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided, at the instance of Octavius, to make Cisalpine Gaul free, as the elder C\u00e6sar had intended. Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been accused of betraying the affairs of the triumvirate to Pompeius. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas decided that if Octavius should find that this accusation was false\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother provinces should be given to Lepidus. They dismissed from the military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice the soldiers who had served their full time, except 8000 who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked to remain. These they took back and divided between themselves and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed them in pr\u00e6torian cohorts. There remained to them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding those who had come over from Brutus, eleven legions of infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 14,000 horse. Of these Antony took, for his foreign expedition, six\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions and 10,000 horse. Octavius had five legions and 4000 horse, but of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese he gave two legions to Antony in exchange for others that Antony had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft in Italy under the command of Calenus. Then Octavius proceeded toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Antony arrived at Ephesus he offered a splendid sacrifice to the city's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoddess and pardoned those who, after the disaster to Brutus and Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fled to the temple as suppliants, except Petronius, who had been privy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the murder of C\u00e6sar, and Quintus, who had betrayed Dolabella to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius at Laodicea. Having assembled the Greeks and other peoples who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabited the Asiatic country around Pergamos, and who were present on a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace embassy, and others who had been summoned thither, Antony addressed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem as follows: \"Your King Attalus, O Greeks, left you to us in his will,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand straightway we proved better to you than Attalus had been, for we\n\t\t\t\t\t\treleased you from the taxes that you had been paying to him, until the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taction of popular agitators among us made these taxes necessary. When they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame necessary we did not impose them upon you according to a fixed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluation so that we could collect an absolutely certain sum, but we\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired you to contribute a portion of your yearly harvest in order that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight share with you the vicissitudes of the seasons. When the publicans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho made these collections by the authority of the Senate, wronged you by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemanding more than was due, Gaius C\u00e6sar remitted to you one-third\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof what you had paid to them and put an end to their outrages; for he even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned over to you the collection of the taxes from the cultivators of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoil. And this was the kind of man that our honorable citizens called a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrant, and you contributed vast sums of money to the murderers of your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefactor and against us, who were seeking to avenge him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Now that a just fortune has decided the war, not as you wished, but as was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright, if we were to treat you as allies of our enemies we should be obliged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto punish you. But as we are willing to believe that you were constrained to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis course by necessity, we will release you from the heavier penalty. We\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed money and land and cities as rewards for our soldiers. There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty-eight legions of infantry which, with the auxiliaries, amount to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupwards of 170,000 men, besides cavalry and various other arms of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice. The sum that we need for such a vast number of men you can easily\n\t\t\t\t\t\timagine. Octavius has gone to Italy to provide them with land and cities --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto expropriate Italy, if we must speak plainly. That we may not be under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity of expelling you from your lands, cities, houses, temples, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttombs, we must count upon getting money from you, not all that you have (we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould not think of that), but a part, a very small part, which, when you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearn it, I think you will cheerfully pay. What you contributed to our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies in two years (for you gave them the taxes of ten years in that time)\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be quite sufficient for us; but it must be paid in one year, because we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare pressed by necessity. As you are sensible of our leniency toward you, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill merely add that the penalty imposed is by no means equal to your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserts.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony spoke thus of providing a donative for twenty-eight legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfantry, whereas I think that they had forty-three legions when they came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto their agreement at Mutina and made these promises, but the war had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably reduced them to this number. The Greeks, while he was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaking, threw themselves upon the ground, declaring that they had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjected to force and violence by Brutus and Cassius, and that they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserving of pity, not of punishment; that they would willingly give to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir benefactors, but that they had been stripped by their enemies, to whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had delivered not only their money, but, in default of money, their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplate and their ornaments, and who had coined these things into money in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir presence. Finally, they prevailed by their entreaties that the amount\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be reduced to nine years' taxes, payable in two years. It was ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the kings, princes, and free cities should make additional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributions according to their means, respectively. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Antony was making the circuit of the provinces Lucius Cassius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother of Gaius, and some others, who feared for their own safety, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey heard of the pardon of Ephesus, presented themselves to him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuppliants. He released them all except those who had been privy to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurder of C\u00e6sar. To these alone he was inexorable. He gave relief\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the cities that had suffered most severely. He released the Lycians from\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaxes altogether, and urged the rebuilding of Xanthus. He gave to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians Andros, Tenos, Naxos, and Myndus, which were taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom them not long afterward because they ruled them harshly. He made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLaodicea and Tarsus free cities and released them from taxes entirely, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose inhabitants of Tarsus who had been sold into slavery he liberated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan order. To the Athenians when they came to see him he gave \u00c6gina\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin exchange for Tenos, and also Icos, Cea, Sciathos, and Peparethos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProceeding onward to Phrygia, Mysia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u0153le-Syria, Palestine, Itur\u00e6a, and the other provinces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Syria, he imposed heavy contributions on all, and acted as arbiter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween kings and cities, -- in Cappadocia, for example, between Ariarthes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Sisinna, awarding the kingdom to Sisinna on account of his mother,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlaphyra, who appeared to him to be a beautiful woman. In Syria he delivered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cities from tyrants one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Cleopatra came to meet him in Cilicia, and he blamed her for not sharing\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir labors in avenging C\u00e6sar. Instead of apologizing she\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenumerated to him the things she had done, saying that she had sent the four\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions that had been left with her to Dolabella forthwith, and that she had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother fleet in readiness, but had been prevented from sending it by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadverse winds and by the misfortune of Dolabella, whose defeat came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly; that she did not lend assistance to Cassius, who had threatened\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther twice; that while the war was going on she had set sail for the Adriatic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin person with a fleet to assist them, in defiance of Cassius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisregarding Murcus, who was lying in wait for her; but that a tempest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshattered the fleet and prostrated herself with illness, for which reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshe was not able to put to sea again till they had already gained their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory. Antony was amazed at her wit as well as her good looks, and became\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther captive as though he were a young man, although he was forty years of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tage. It is said that he was always very susceptible in this way, and that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been enamoured of her long ago when she was still a girl and he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserving as master of horse under Gabinius at Alexandria. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Straightway Antony's interest in public affairs began to dwindle. Whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCleopatra ordered was done, regardless of laws, human or divine. While her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsister Arsinoe was a suppliant in the temple of Artemis Leucophryne at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiletus, Antony sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassassins thither and put her to death. Serapion, Cleopatra's prefect in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCyprus, who had assisted Cassius and was now a suppliant at Tyre, Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered the Tyrians to deliver to her. He commanded the Aradians to deliver\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup another suppliant who, when Ptolemy, the brother of Cleopatra,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisappeared at the battle with C\u00e6sar on the Nile, said that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPtolemy, and whom the Aradians now held. He ordered the priest of Artemis at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEphesus, whom they called Megabyzus, and who had once received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArsinoe as queen, to be brought before him, but in response to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplications of the Ephesians, addressed to Cleopatra herself, released\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. So swiftly was Antony transformed, and this passion was the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the end of evils that befell him. When Cleopatra returned home Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent a cavalry force to Palmyra, situated not far from the Euphrates, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplunder it, bringing the trifling accusations against its inhabitants, that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing on the frontier between the Romans and the Parthians, they had avoided\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking sides between them; for, being merchants, they bring the products of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia and Arabia and dispose of them in the Roman territory. In fact,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's intention was to enrich his horsemen, but the Palmyreans were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforewarned and they transported their property across the river, and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationing themselves on the bank, prepared to shoot anybody who should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack them, for they were expert bowmen. The cavalry found nothing in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity. They turned around and came back, having met no foe, and empty-handed. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that this course on Antony's part caused the outbreak of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParthian war not long afterward, as many of the rulers expelled from Syria\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad taken refuge with the Parthians. Syria, until the reign of Antiochus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPius and his son, Antiochus, had been ruled by the descendants of Seleucus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNicator, as I have related in my Syrian history. Pompey added it to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman sway, and Scaurus was appointed pr\u00e6tor over it. After\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScaurus the Senate sent others, including Gabinius, who made war against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexandrians, and after Gabinius, Crassus, who lost his life in the Parthian\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar, and after Crassus, Bibulus. At the time of C\u00e6sar's death and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe intestine strife which followed, tyrants got possession of the cities\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone by one, and they were assisted by the Parthians, who made an irruption\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto Syria after the disaster to Crassus and co\u00f6perated with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrants. Antony drove out the latter, who took refuge in Parthia. He then\n\t\t\t\t\t\timposed very heavy tribute on the masses and committed the outrage already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned against the Palmyreans, and did not wait for the disturbed country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto become quiet, but distributed his army in winter quarters in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, and himself went to Egypt to join Cleopatra. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t She gave him a magnificent reception, and he spent the winter there without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe insignia of his office and with the habit and mode of life of a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson, either because he was in a foreign jurisdiction, in a city under\n\t\t\t\t\t\troyal sway, or because he regarded his wintering as a festal occasion. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid aside the cares and duties of a general, and wore the square-cut\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarment of the Greeks instead of the costume of his own country, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhite Attic shoe of the Athenian and Alexandrian priests, which they call\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ph\u0153casium. He went out only to the temples,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe schools, and the discussions of the learned, and spent his time with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreeks, out of deference to Cleopatra, to whom his sojourn in Alexandria was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twholly devoted. Such was the state of affairs with Antony. \n\t\t\t\t"},"1":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As Octavius was journeying to Rome he became dangerously ill at Brundusium,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a rumor gained currency that he was dead. On his recovery he returned to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city and showed to Antony's friends the letters Antony had written. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntonians directed Calenus to give Octavius the two legions, and wrote to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSextius in Africa to turn that province over to him. This was the course of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Antonians while, as it appeared that Lepidus had not been guilty of any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserious wrong, Octavius transferred Africa to him in exchange for his former\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces. He also sold the remainder of the property confiscated under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconscriptions. The task of assigning the soldiers to their colonies and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdividing the land was one of exceeding difficulty. The soldiers demanded the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities which had been selected for them before the war as prizes for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalor. The cities demanded that the whole of Italy should share the burden,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor that the cities should cast lots with the other cities, and that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho gave the land should be paid the value of it; but there was no money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey came to Rome in crowds, young and old, women and children, to the forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the temples, uttering lamentations, saying that they had done no wrong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor which they, Italians, should be driven from their fields and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thearthstones, like people conquered in war. The Romans mourned and wept with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, especially when they reflected that the war had been waged, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards of victory given, not in behalf of the commonwealth, but against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and for a change of the form of government; that the colonies\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere established so that democracy should never again lift its head, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies composed of hirelings settled there by the rulers to be in\n\t\t\t\t\t\treadiness for whatever purpose they might be wanted. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius explained to the cities the necessity of the case, but he knew that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit would not satisfy them; and it did not. The soldiers encroached upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir neighbors in an insolent manner, seizing more than had been given to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and choosing the best lands; nor did they cease when Octavius rebuked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and made them numerous other presents. They were contemptuous in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge that their rulers needed them to confirm their power, for the five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears' term of the triumvirate was passing away, and army and rulers needed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe services of each other for mutual security. The chiefs depended on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers for the continuance of their government, while, for the control of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat they had received, the soldiers depended on the permanence of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of those who had given it. Believing that they could not keep a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm hold unless the givers had a strong government, they fought for them with good-will,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily. Octavius made many other gifts to the indigent soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing from the temples for that purpose, for which reason the affections\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the army were turned toward him. The greater thanks were bestowed upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim both as the giver of the land, the cities, the money, and the houses,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand as the object of denunciation on the part of the despoiled, and as one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho bore this contumely for the army's sake. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Observing this, Lucius Antonius, the brother of Antony, who was then consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Fulvia, the wife of Antony, and Manius, his procurator during his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsence, resorted to artifices to delay the settlement of the colonies till\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony should return home, in order that it might not seem to be wholly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork of Octavius, and that he might not reap the thanks alone, and Antony be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbereft of the favor of the soldiers. As this could not be done, on account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the haste of the soldiers, they asked that Octavius should take the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolony leaders of Antony's legions from Antony's own friends, although the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement with Antony yielded the selection to Octavius exclusively. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade it a matter of complaint that Antony was not present. They brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFulvia and Antony's children before the soldiers, and, in envious terms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesought them not to forget Antony or allow him to be deprived of the glory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor the gratitude due to his service to them. The fame of Antony was then at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits maximum, not only among the soldiers, but among all others. The victory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Philippi was considered wholly due to him, on account of Octavius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillness. Although Octavius was not ignorant that it was a violation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement, he yielded as a matter of favor to Antony, and appointed friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the latter as colony leaders for Antony's legions. These leaders, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder that they might appear more favorable to the soldiers than Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas, allowed them to commit still greater outrages. So there was another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude from other communities, neighbors of the dispossessed ones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffering many injuries at the hands of the soldiers, and crying out against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, saying that the colonization was worse than the proscription,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the latter was directed against foes, while the former was against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinoffensive persons. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius knew that these citizens were suffering injustice, but he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout means to prevent it. There was no money to pay the value of the land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the cultivators, nor could the rewards to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers be postponed, on account of the enemies who were still on foot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius ruled the sea and was reducing the city to famine by cutting off\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies. Ahenobarbus and Murcus were collecting a new fleet and army. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers would be less zealous in the future if they were not paid for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer service. It was a matter of much importance that the five years' term\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof office was running out, and that the good-will of the soldiers was needed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto renew it, for which reason he was willing to overlook for the time being\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir insolence and arrogance. Once in the theatre when he was present, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldier, not finding his own seat, went and took one in the place reserved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the knights. The people pointed him out and Octavius had him removed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe soldiers were angry. They gathered around Octavius as he was going away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the theatre and demanded their comrade, for, as they did not see him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey thought that he had been put to death. When he was produced before them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey supposed that he had been brought from prison, but he denied that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been imprisoned and related what had taken place. They said that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen instructed to tell a lie and reproached him for betraying their common\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests. Such was the example of their insolence in the theatre. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having been called, about that time, to the Campus Martius for a division of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land, they came in haste while it was still night, and they grew angry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Octavius delayed his coming. Nonius, a centurion, chided them with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable freedom, urging decent treatment of the commander by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommanded, and saying that the cause of the delay was Octavius' illness, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\this disregard of them. They first jeered at him as a sycophant. Then, as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcitement waxed hot on both sides, they reviled him, threw stones at him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand pursued him when he fled. Finally he plunged into the river and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpulled him out and killed him and threw his body into the road where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius was about to pass along. The friends of Octavius advised him not to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo among them, but to keep out of the way of their mad career. But he went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward, thinking that their madness would be augmented if he did not come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen he saw the body of Nonius he turned aside. Then, assuming that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrime had been committed by a few, he chided them and advised them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\texercise forbearance toward each other hereafter, and proceeded to divide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land. He allowed the meritorious ones to ask for rewards, and he gave to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome who were not meritorious, contrary to their expectation. Finally the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowd were confounded. They repented and were ashamed of their importunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey condemned themselves and asked him to search out and punish the slayers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Nonius. He replied that he knew them and would punish them only with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own guilty consciences and the condemnation of their comrades. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers, thus honored with pardon, rewards, and gifts, changed at once to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoyful acclamations. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Let these two instances serve as examples of the prevailing insubordination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cause was that the generals, for the most part, as is usually the case\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin civil wars, were not regularly chosen; that their armies were not drawn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the enrolment according to the custom of the fathers, nor for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefit of their country; that they did not serve the public so much as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid the individuals who brought them together; and that they served these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot by the force of law, but by reason of private promises; not against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon enemy, but against private foes; not against foreigners, but against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizens, their equals in rank. All these things impaired military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscipline, and the soldiers thought that they were not so much serving in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army as lending assistance, by their own favor and judgment, to leaders\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho needed them for their own personal ends. Desertion, which had formerly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen unpardonable, was now rewarded with gifts, and whole armies resorted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, including some illustrious men, who did not consider it desertion to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange to a similar cause, for all parties were alike, since neither of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be distinguished as battling against the common enemy of the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople. The common pretence of the generals that they were all striving for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe good of the country made desertion easy in the thought that one could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserve his country in any party. Understanding these facts the generals\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttolerated this behavior, for they knew that their authority over their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies depended on donatives rather than on law. Thus, everything was torn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin factions, and the armies indulged in insubordination toward the leaders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the factions. \n\t\t\t\t"},"2":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now famine began to afflict Rome, the supplies by sea being cut off by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, and Italian agriculture ruined by the wars.

There were acts of violence worse than robbery which went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunpunished, and which were supposed to have been committed by soldiers. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople closed their shops and drove the magistrates from their places as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough there were no need of courts of justice, or of the useful arts in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity oppressed by hunger and infested with brigands. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Lucius Antonius, who was a republican and ill affected toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirate, which seemed not likely to come to an end at the appointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, fell into controversy, and even graver differences, with Octavius. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone received kindly, and promised aid to, the agriculturists who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprived of their lands and who were now the suppliants of every man of\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportance; and they promised to carry out his orders. Antony's soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Octavius also, blamed him for working against Antony's interests, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFulvia blamed him for stirring up war at an inopportune time, until Manius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaliciously changed her mind by telling her that as long as Italy remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat peace Antony would stay with Cleopatra, but that if war should break out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere he would come back speedily. Then Fulvia, moved by a woman's jealousy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincited Lucius to discord. While Octavius was leading out the last of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies she sent the children of Antony, together with Lucius, to follow\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, so that he should not acquire too great eclat with the army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby being seen alone. A body of Octavius' cavalry made an expedition to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoast of Bruttium, which Pompeius was ravaging, and Lucius either thought or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretended to think that it had been sent against himself and Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildren. Accordingly, he betook himself to the Antonian colonies to collect\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta body-guard, and accused Octavius to the soldiers as being treacherous to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. Octavius replied that everything was on a friendly and harmonius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfooting between himself and Antony, and that Lucius was trying to stir up a\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar between them for another reason, in that he was working against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirate, by virtue of which the soldiers had a firm hold upon their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies, and that the cavalry were now in Bruttium executing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirate's orders. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the officers of the army learned these facts, they arbitrated between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius and Octavius at Teanum and brought them to an agreement on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing terms: That the consuls should exercise their office in the manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the fathers and not be hindered by the triumvirs; that the land should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned only to those who fought at Philippi; that of the money derived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom confiscated property, and of the value of that which was still to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsold, Antony's soldiers in Italy should have an equal share; that neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony nor Octavius should draw soldiers from Italy by conscription\n\t\t\t\t\t\thereafter; that two of Antony's legions should serve with Octavius in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcampaign against Pompeius; that the passes of the Alps should be opened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forces sent by Octavius into Spain, and that Asinius Pollio should not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther interfere with them; that Lucius should be satisfied with those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions, should dispense with his body-guard, and administer his office\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearlessly.

Thus arrogantly did Manius proclaim\n\t\t\t\t\t\this views, implying that Octavius could not do anything by his own authority\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that his agreement with Antony was of no validity, although it provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat each should have absolute power over the affairs committed to him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat each should ratify what was done by the other.

The ambassadors then united with the officers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis army in a common embassy to Lucius asking him to submit his controversy\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Octavius to a tribunal; and they made it plain what they would do if he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not accept the decision. Lucius and his friends accepted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposal, and fixed the place for the trial at Gabii, a city midway between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome and Pr\u00e6neste.

Octavius, who arrived first, sent some horsemen along the road by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Lucius was to come, in order to find out whether any stratagem was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscoverable. These met certain horsemen of Lucius, either his advance guard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor men spying like the others, and as the two parties came into collision\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of them were killed. Lucius retreated, saying that he was afraid of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing entrapped, and, although recalled by the officers of the army, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to escort him, he could not be persuaded to come again. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus the negotiations came to nothing, and Octavius and Lucius resolved upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar and issued proclamations full of bitterness against each other. The army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Lucius consisted of six legions of infantry, which he commanded by virtue\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his consulship, and eleven others belonging to Antony, which were under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe command of Calenus. These were all in Italy. Octavius had four legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Capua and some pr\u00e6torian cohorts about his person. Salvidienus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas leading six other legions to Spain. Lucius had supplies of money\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Antony's provinces where peace prevailed. War was raging in all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces that had fallen to the lot of Octavius except Sardinia, for which\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason he borrowed money from the temples, promising to return it with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks -- from the Capitoline temple at Rome, from those of Antium, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLanuvium, of Nemus, and of Tibur, in which cities there are to-day the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabundant stores of consecrated money. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The affairs of Octavius were in disorder outside of Italy also. Pompeius, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason of the proscription, the colonizing of the soldiers, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissensions with Lucius, had gained much in reputation and power. Those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared for their safety, or had been despoiled of their property, or who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutterly abhorred the form of government, mostly went and joined him. Young\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, also, eager for military service for the sake of gain, and who thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it made no difference under whom they served, since all service was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman service, rather preferred to join Pompeius as representing the better\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause. He had become rich by sea-robbery and had a numerous fleet and a full\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplement of men. Murcus joined him with two legions of soldiers, 500\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarchers, a large sum of money, and eighty ships. He also sent after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother army from Cephalenia. Accordingly, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons think that if Pompeius had then invaded Italy, which was afflicted\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith famine and civil strife, and was looking for him, he might have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmastered it. But Pompeius lacked wisdom. His idea was not to invade, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly to defend, and this he did till he failed of that also. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In Africa Sextius, Antony's lieutenant, had just delivered his army, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuance of an order from Lucius, to Fango, a lieutenant of Octavius. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas ordered to resume the command, and as Fango would not relinquish it he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected a force composed of retired veterans, a miscellaneous crowd of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfricans, and auxiliaries of the native princes, and made war on him. Fango,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving been defeated on both wings and having lost his camp, thought that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been betrayed, and committed suicide; and Sextius again became master of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe two African provinces. Bocchus, king of Mauritania, at the instance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius, made war on Carinas, who was Octavius' procurator in Spain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAhenobarbus, who was patrolling the Adriatic with seventy ships, two legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof soldiers, and a force of archers and slingers, light-armed troops and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgladiators, devastated the regions subject to the triumvirs. He sailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Brundusium, captured some of the triremes of Octavius, burned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers, shut the inhabitants up in their walls, and plundered their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterritory. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius sent a legion of soldiers to Brundusium and hastily recalled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvidienus from his march to Spain. Both Octavius and Lucius sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecruiting officers through-out Italy, who had skirmishes with each other of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore or less importance, and frequent ambuscades. The good-will of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalians was of great service to Lucius, as they believed that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfighting for them against the new colonies. Not only the cities that had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen designated for the army, but almost the whole of Italy, rose, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike treatment. They drove out of the towns, or killed, those who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing money from the temples for Octavius, manned their walls, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined Lucius. On the other hand, the colonized soldiers joined Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEach one in both parties took sides as though this were his own war. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Though these events were taking place, Octavius, nevertheless, convoked the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate and the equestrian order and addressed them as follows: \"I know very\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell that I am accused by Lucius and his friends of weakness and want of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourage because I do not fight them, and that I shall be still further\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccused on account of my calling you together. I have strong forces who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered wrong in common with me, both those who have been dispossessed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir colonies by Lucius and the others whom I have in hand. I am strong in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall respects except only in the purpose to fight. I am not fond of fighting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin civil wars except under dire necessity, or of wasting the remainder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour citizens in conflicts with each other; least of all in this civil war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose horrors will be announced to us not from Macedonia or Thrace, but will\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake place in Italy itself, which, if it becomes the field of battle, must\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffer countless evils in addition to the loss of life. For these reasons I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thesitate. And now I protest that I have done Antony no wrong. Nor have I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered any wrong from him. I beseech you to reason with Lucius and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends on your own account, and to bring them to a reconciliation with me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you cannot now persuade them, I shall presently show them that I have\n\t\t\t\t\t\thitherto been moved by good-will, not by cowardice. I ask you to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\twitnesses for me not only among yourselves, but also to Antony, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustain me on account of the arrogance of Lucius.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t So spake Octavius. Thereupon some of his hearers went again to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPr\u00e6neste. Lucius said to them merely, that both sides had already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegun hostilities, that Octavius was practising deception; for he had lately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent a legion to Brundusium to prevent Antony from coming home. Manius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed a letter of Antony's, either true or fictitious, saying that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould fight if anybody assailed his dignity. When the senators asked if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody had assailed Antony's dignity, and urged Manius to submit that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion to trial, he indulged in many other quibbles till they went away\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout transacting their business. Nor did they collectively bring any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer to Octavius, either because they had communicated it each for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, or because they were ashamed, or for some other reason. The war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroke out and Octavius set forth to take part in it, leaving Lepidus with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo legions to guard Rome. Most of the optimates then showed, by joining\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius, that they were not pleased with the rule of the triumvirs. \n\t\t\t\t"},"3":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The following were the principal events of the war. A sedition broke out in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo of Lucius' legions at Alba, which expelled their commanding officers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted to revolt. Both Octavius and Lucius hastened to them. Lucius arrived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere first and kept them by a large donative and great promises. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFurnius was bringing a re\u00ebnforcement to Lucius, Octavius fell upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\this rear guard. Furnius took refuge on a hill and withdrew by night to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSentia, a city of his own faction. Octavius did not dare to follow by night,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspecting an ambush, but the next day he laid siege to Sentia and Furnius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp together. Lucius, who was hastening toward Rome, sent forward three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcohorts, which effected an entrance into the city clandestinely by night. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed with his main army and some cavalry and gladiators. Nonius, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharge of the gates, admitted him, and handed over to him the forces under\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own command. Lepidus fled to Octavius. Lucius made a speech to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, saying that he should visit punishment upon Octavius and Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor their lawless rule, and that his brother would voluntarily resign his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of it and accept the consulship, exchanging an unlawful magistracy for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta lawful one, and establishing the government of their fathers in place of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyranny. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t All were delighted with this speech, and thought that the government of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumvirs was already ended. Lucius was saluted as imperator by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe marched against Octavius, and collected a fresh army from the cities\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonized by Antony's soldiers, and strengthened their fortifications. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies were well affected toward Antony. Barbatius, a qu\u00e6stor of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, who had had some difficulty with him and was returning home for that\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason, said, in answer to inquiries, that Antony was displeased with those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were making war on Octavius to the prejudice of their common sway;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon some, who were not aware of the deception practised by Barbatius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged sides from Lucius to Octavius. Lucius put himself in the way of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvidienus, who was returning to Octavius with a large army from Gaul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsinius and Ventidius, Antony's generals, were following Salvidienus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevent him from advancing. Agrippa, who was the closest friend of Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearing lest Salvidienus should be surrounded, seized Sutrium, a stronghold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery useful to Lucius, expecting that Lucius would turn from Salvidienus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst himself, and that Salvidienus, who would then be in the rear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius, would assist him (Agrippa). It all turned out as Agrippa had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated. So Lucius, having failed of his undertaking, marched to join\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsinius and Ventidius. Salvidienus and Agrippa harassed him on both sides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatching especially for an opportunity to catch him in the defiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Lucius perceived their design he did not dare to come to an engagement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith both of them closing in upon him. So he turned aside to Perusia, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly fortified city, and encamped near it, to wait there for Ventidius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgrippa, Salvidienus, and Octavius advanced against him and against Perusia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand enclosed them with three armies, and Octavius summoned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tre\u00ebnforcements in haste from all directions, as against the vital\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint of the war, where he had Lucius surrounded. He sent others forward to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold in check the forces of Ventidius, who were approaching. The latter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, hesitated on their own account to advance, as they did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\taltogether approve of the war and did not know what Antony thought about it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand on account of mutual rivalry were unwilling to yield to each other the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary chieftainship. Lucius did not go out to battle with the forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding him, because they were better and more numerous and well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrilled, while his were for the most part new levies; nor did he resume his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarch, for so many enemies were on his flanks. He sent Manius to Ventidius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Asinius to hasten them to the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t AGRIPPA \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Museum of the Louvre (Duruy) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t aid of the besieged, and he sent Tisienus with 4000 horse to pillage the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's supplies, in order to force him to raise the siege. Lucius entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin the walls of Perusia so that he might winter in a strong place, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, until Ventidius and Asinius should arrive. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius, with all haste and with his whole army, drew a line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumvallation around Perusia fifty-six stades in circuit, on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hill on which it was situated; he extended long arms to the Tiber, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nothing could be introduced into the place. Lucius built a similar line\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof countervallation, thus fortifying the foot of the hill. Fulvia urged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVentidius, Asinius, Ateius, and Calenus to hasten from Gaul to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance of Lucius, and collected re\u00ebnforcements, which she sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Lucius under the lead of Plancus. Plancus destroyed one of Octavius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, which was on the march to Rome. While Asinius and Ventidius were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeding, at the instance of Fulvia and Manius, to the relief of Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(but with hesitation and doubt as to Antony's preference), in order to raise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe blockade, Octavius and Agrippa, leaving a guard at Perusia, threw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves in the way. The former, who had not yet formed a junction with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other and were not proceeding with much alacrity, retreated, -- Asinius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Ravenna and Ventidius to Ariminum. Plancus took refuge in Spoletium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius stationed a force in front of each, to prevent them from forming a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjunction, and returned to Perusia, where he speedily strengthened his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment of the place and doubled the depth and width of his ditch to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdimensions of thirty feet each way. He increased the height of his wall and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt 1500 wooden towers on it, sixty feet apart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe had also strong redoubts and every other kind of intrenchment, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble front, to besiege those within and to repel assaults from without.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile these works were under construction there were frequent sorties and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfights, in which the forces of Octavius had the advantage in the use of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmissiles, and the gladiators of Lucius were better at hand-to-hand fighting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo these killed many at close quarters. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the work of Octavius was finished famine fastened upon Lucius, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevil grew more pressing, since neither he nor the city had made preparations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore-hand. Knowing this fact Octavius kept the most vigilant\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatch. On the day preceding the Calends of January, Lucius thought to avail\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself of the holiday, under the belief that the enemy would be off their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard, to make a sally by night against their gates, hoping to break through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and bring in his other forces, of which he had abundance in many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaces. But the legion that was lying in wait near by, and Octavius himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith some pr\u00e6torian cohorts, attacked him, and Lucius, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought valiantly, was driven back. About the same time the mass of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople in Rome openly denounced the war and the victory, because the grain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas kept under guard for the soldiers. They broke into houses in search of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfood, and carried off whatever they could find. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Ventidius and his friends, ashamed to look on while Lucius was perishing of\n\t\t\t\t\t\thunger, all moved to his support, intending to overpower the forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding and besieging him. Agrippa and Salvidienus went to meet them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith still larger forces. Fearing lest they should be surrounded, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiverged to the stronghold of Fulginium, distant 160 stades from Perusia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere Agrippa besieged them, and they lighted fires as signals to Lucius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVentidius and Asinius were of the opinion that they should go forward and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfight, but Plancus said that, as they were between Octavius and Agrippa,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had best await events. The opinion of Plancus prevailed. Those in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerusia were rejoiced when they saw the fires, but when Ventidius delayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this coming they conjectured that he, too, was in difficulties, and when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfires ceased they thought that he had been destroyed. Lucius, oppressed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\thunger, again fought a night battle, extending from the first watch till\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaylight, around the whole circumvallation; but he failed and was driven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback into Perusia. There he took an account of the remaining provisions, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbade the giving of any to the slaves, and prohibited them from escaping,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlest the enemy should gain better knowledge of his desperate situation. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves wandered about in crowds, threw themselves upon the ground in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, and between the city and their forts, and ate grass or green leaves\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever they could find them. Those who died Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburied in long trenches, lest, if he burned them, the enemy should discover\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat was taking place, and, if they were unburied, disease should result\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the poisonous exhalations. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As no end of the famine, or of the deaths, could be discerned, the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame restive under the condition of affairs, and implored Lucius to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother attempt upon the enemy's works, believing that they could break\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough them completely. He approved of their ardor, saying, \"In our recent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle we did not fight in a way corresponding to our present necessity. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe must either surrender, or, if that seems worse than death, we must fight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the death.\" All assented eagerly, and, in order that no one should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe night for an excuse, they demanded to be led out by daylight. Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarched out at dawn. He took an abundance of iron tools, for wall fighting,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ladders of every form. He carried machines for filling the ditches, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfolding towers from which planks could be thrown to the walls; also all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinds of missiles and stones and wickerwork to be thrown upon the palisades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey made a violent assault, filled up the ditch, scaled the palisades, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced to the walls, which some of them undermined, while others applied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ladders, and others simultaneously moved up the towers and defended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves with stones, arrows, and leaden balls, with absolute contempt of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. This was done at many different places, and the enemy being drawn in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany different directions made a more feeble resistance. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The planks having been thrown upon the walls at some places, the struggle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame very hazardous, for the forces of Lucius fighting on bridges were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to missiles and javelins on every side. They forced their way,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless, and a few leaped over the wall. Others followed, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould speedily have accomplished something important in their desperation\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not the fact become known to Octavius that they had not many such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmachines, and had not the best of his reserves been brought to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance of the tired men. These fresh troops flung the assailants down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the walls, broke their machines in pieces, and hurled missiles upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem contemptuously from above. Their enemy, although their shields and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies were pierced and even their voices had failed, held their ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbravely. When the corpses of those who had been killed on the wall were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstripped and thrown down among them, they could not bear the indignity, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned away from the spectacle and stood for a moment undecided, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tathletes taking a breathing-spell in the gymnastic games. Lucius had pity on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem in this condition and sounded a retreat. Then the troops of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoyfully clashed their arms as for a victory, whereupon those of Lucius were\n\t\t\t\t\t\troused to anger and again seized their ladders (although they had no more\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowers), and carried them to the walls with desperation. Yet they did not do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany harm to the enemy, for they could not. Lucius ran among them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesought them to sacrifice their lives no longer, and led them back groaning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand reluctant. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This was the end of this hotly contested siege. In order that the enemy might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot make another attempt on his works, Octavius stationed a part of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, that was held in reserve, alongside the fortifications, and instructed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers in other places to leap upon the wall at the sound of the trumpet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough no one urged them on, they went through this exercise continually,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to become familiar with it, and to inspire the enemy with fear. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops of Lucius began to grow down-hearted, and, as usually happens in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcases, the guards relaxed their vigilance, and thus desertion became more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequent, not only of the common soldiers, but, in some cases, of the higher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers also. And now Lucius inclined toward peace, out of pity for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperishing multitude, but the fears of some of the enemies of Octavius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own safety still restrained him. But as Octavius was observed to treat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deserters kindly, and the desire for peace increased among all, Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan to fear lest, if he refused, he should be delivered up. \n\t\t\t\t"},"4":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, having made a sort of test which gave him encouragement, Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled his army together and spoke as follows: \"It was my intention,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-soldiers, to restore the republic to you when I saw that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of the triumvirs was a tyranny, which was established, indeed, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pretext of combating Brutus and Cassius, but was not relaxed after their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Lepidus had been deprived of his share of the government, Antony was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar away collecting money, and this one man was managing everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to his own will, and the ancient system of Roman government was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly a pretence and a laughing-stock. With the intention of reverting to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom and democratic government of our ancestors, I asked that after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards of victory had been distributed the monarchy should be dissolved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen my request was not granted, I sought to enforce it by virtue of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice. Octavius falsely accused me, before the army, of obstructing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies out of pity for the landowners. I was ignorant of this slander for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta long time, and even when I learned of it I did not suppose that anybody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould believe it, when one saw that the colony officers were men assigned by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy very self to divide the lands among you. But the calumny misled some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, who joined Octavius in order to make war against us as they think.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut eventually they will find that they have been warring against their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests. I affirm that you have chosen the better cause, and that you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered for it beyond your strength. We are vanquished, not by our enemies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut by hunger, to which we have been left a prey by our own generals. It would be becoming in me to fight to the last\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremity for my country. Such an end would make my fame glorious after my\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh purposes. To that destiny I do not submit, for the sake of you, whom I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprefer to my own fame. I will send to the conqueror and beg that he will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflict such punishment as he chooses upon me alone, in place of all of you;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he will grant amnesty, not to me, but to you, his fellow-citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformerly his soldiers, who are not now in the wrong, who are not fighting\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout good cause, and are vanquished, not by war, but by hunger.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After speaking thus he at once selected three men from the optimates for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmission. The multitude wept, some on their own account, some on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir general, who appeared to them to have been actuated by the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcellent and democratic purpose, and who now yielded to extreme necessity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe three envoys, when admitted to the presence of Octavius, reminded him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the soldiers on both sides were all of one race, and that they had made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcampaigns together. They called to mind the friendship of the nobility on\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither side and also the virtue of their ancestors, who did not allow their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferences to become irreconcilable. They advanced other like arguments\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were calculated to prevail with him. Octavius, knowing that some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy were still raw recruits, while others were colonized veterans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplied artfully that he would grant amnesty to Antony's soldiers out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard for him, but that the others must surrender at discretion. This he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid in the presence of all, but, taking aside Furnius, one of the three, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tled him to expect mild treatment for Lucius and the rest, except his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersonal enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t These personal enemies of Octavius, having learned of Furnius' private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterview and suspecting that it related to themselves, reproached him when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the came back, and demanded of Lucius either that he should ask a new treaty,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich should include all alike, or fight to the death, saying that this had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot been a private war for any individual, but a public one in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. Lucius in pity commended them as men of the same rank as himself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand said that he would send another embassy. Then he added that no one was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter fitted for this task than himself, and went immediately without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\therald, merely preceded by some persons who went in advance to announce to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius his coming. The latter at once advanced to meet him. There they saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other surrounded by their friends and distinguished by the standards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand military equipment of generals on either side. Then Lucius, dismissing\n\t\t\t\t\t\this friends, went forward with two lictors only, showing his state of mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby his outward appearance. Octavius understood and imitated his example,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowing his intended good-will toward Lucius. When he saw the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastening to pass inside his fortification, indicating thereby that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready surrendered, Octavius anticipated him and went outside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification in order that Lucius might still be free to consult and decide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning his own interests. Thus as they moved forward they foreshadowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir intentions to each other in advance, by their retinue and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutward appearance. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When they came to the ditch they saluted each other, and Lucius said: \"If I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere a foreigner waging war against you, Octavius, I should consider it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisgraceful to be vanquished in this way and still more disgraceful to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender, and I should have for myself an easy means of deliverance from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch humiliation. Since I have been contending with a countryman, my equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin rank, in a matter appertaining to our common country, I do not consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit disgraceful to be beaten in such a cause by such a man. This I say not to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprecate any suffering that you may choose to inflict upon me (for you see\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I have come to your camp without any guarantee), but to ask for others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch pardon as may be just, and conducive to your own interests. That I may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake this clear to you it is necessary to separate their cause from mine, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, when you know that I am the only one to blame, you may visit your\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrath upon me, and not think that I have come here to bandy words (that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be inopportune), but to tell the truth, for it is not in my power to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeak otherwise. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"I undertook this war against you, not in order to succeed to the leadership\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby destroying you, but to restore to the country the patrician government\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been subverted by the triumvirate, as not even yourself will deny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor when you created the triumvirate you acknowledged that it was not in\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordance with law, but you established it as something necessary and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemporary because Cassius and Brutus were still alive and you could not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciled to them. When they, who had been the head of the faction, were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, and the remainder, if there were any left, were bearing arms, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the state, but because they feared you, and moreover the five years'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm was running out, I demanded that the magistracies should be revived in\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordance with the customs of our fathers, not even preferring my brother\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto my country, but hoping to persuade him to assent upon his return and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastening to bring this about during my own term of office. If you had begun\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reform you alone would have reaped the glory. Since I was not able to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuade you, I thought to march against the city and to use force, being a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen, a nobleman, and a consul. These are the causes of the war I waged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand these alone; not my brother, nor Manius, nor Fulvia, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonization of those who fought at Philippi, nor pity for the cultivators\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were deprived of their holdings, since I myself appointed the leaders of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies to my brother's legions who deprived the cultivators of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessions and divided them among the soldiers. Yet you brought this charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst me before the soldiers, shifting the cause of the war from yourself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the land distribution, and in this way chiefly you drew them to your side\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overcame me, for they were persuaded that I was warring against them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that they were defending themselves against my wrong-doing. You\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertainly needed to use artifice in the war you were waging. Now that you\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave conquered, if you are the enemy of the country you must consider me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour enemy also, since I wished what I thought was for her advantage, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas prevented by famine from accomplishing it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"While I say these things I surrender myself to you, as I have already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared, to do with me whatever you wish.

Concerning my friends and my whole army, if you will not discredit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy words, I will give you some advice for your own best interests, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, that you inflict no severity upon them on account of the quarrel between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou and me. As you are a mortal and in the hands of fortune, which is always\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfickle, do not deter those who might be willing to incur danger for you in\n\t\t\t\t\t\thazardous or trying times hereafter, by teaching them that under your rules\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is no hope of safety except for the victors. Even if all advice from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan enemy is suspected or untrustworthy, I would not hesitate to implore you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to punish my friends for my fault and my ill fortune, but to put the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole punishment on me, who am alone to blame. I purposely left my friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind so that I might not seem, by using these words in their presence, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe securing favor for myself in an underhand way.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After Lucius had thus spoken he relapsed into silence, and Octavius said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"When I saw you, Lucius, approaching without any guarantee I hastened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet you while you were still outside my intrenchments, so that you might\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven now be master of your own counsels and be able to say or do whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou should think best for your own interests. Since you deliver yourself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme (as is customary to those who acknowledge that they are in the wrong), it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis not necessary that I should discuss the false accusations that you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought against me with so much art. You began by injuring me and you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to do so. If you were here negotiating a treaty, you would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdealing with a victor whom you had wronged. Now that you surrender yourself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand your friends and your army without conditions, you take away not only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall resentment, but also the power which, under negotiations for a treaty,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou would necessarily have given me. There is involved in this question not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly what you and your friends ought to suffer, but what it is becoming in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme, as a just man, to do. I shall make the latter my chief consideration on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the gods, on my own account, and on yours, Lucius, and I shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot disappoint the expectation with which you came to me.\" These things they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid to each other, as nearly as it is possible to gather the meaning of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeakers from the Memoirs and translate it into our language. They then separated, and Octavius eulogized and admired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius because he had said nothing impolite or inconsiderate (as is usual in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadversity), and Lucius praised Octavius for his mildness and brevity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech. The others gathered the meaning of what had been said from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountenances of the speakers. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Lucius sent tribunes to receive the watchword for the army from Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey took the army roll to him, as it is still customary for the tribune who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasks for the watchword to deliver to the commander the daily register of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of troops present. After they had received the watchword they still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkept their outposts on duty, for Octavius himself ordered that each army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould keep its own guard that night. The next morning Octavius offered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice, and Lucius sent his soldiers to him bearing their arms, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprepared for marching. They saluted Octavius as imperator while still at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome distance, and each legion took its separate position as Octavius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirected, the colonized veterans being apart from the new levies. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius had finished the sacrifice he took his seat in front of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunal, crowned with laurel, the symbol of victory, and ordered them all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lay down their arms where they stood. When they had done so he ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe veterans to draw nearer, intending to reproach them for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingratitude and to strike terror into them. It was known beforehand what he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas about to do, and his own army, either purposely (as soldiers are often\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvised beforehand), or moved by sympathy as for their own relatives, broke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the formation in which they had been placed, crowded around Lucius' men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas they approached their former fellow-soldiers, embraced them, wept with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, and implored Octavius in their behalf, and ceased not crying out and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembracing them, the new levies sharing in the outburst of feeling, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was impossible to distinguish or discriminate between them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For this reason Octavius did not persist in his intention, but, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeasing the tumult with difficulty, addressed his own men as follows: \"You\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave always behaved in such a way to me, fellow-soldiers, that you can ask\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing from me in vain. I think that the new levies served Lucius under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompulsion. I intended to ask the old soldiers, who have often served with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus and who are now saved from punishment by you, what they have suffered at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour hands, or what favor they have asked in vain, or what greater favors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey expected from anybody else, that they have taken up arms against me,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst you, against them-selves.

He ordered the remainder to pitch\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir tents where they had been stationed, at a certain distance from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers, until he should assign them towns for winter quarters and appoint\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons to lead them thither. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, seated on his tribunal, Octavius summoned from Perusia Lucius and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans of responsibility who were with him. Many of the senators and knights\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame down, all presenting a pitiful appearance by reason of their sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange of fortune. As soon as they passed out of Perusia a guard was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed around it. When they reached the tribunal Octavius placed Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby his own side. Of the rest, some were taken in charge by the friends of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, others by centurions, all of whom had been instructed beforehand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto show them honor and to keep watch upon them unobserved. He commanded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose Perusians to come forward who had stretched out their hands to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the walls, all except their town council, and as they presented\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves he pardoned them. The councillors were thrown into prison and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon afterward put to death, except Lucius \u00c6milius, who had sat as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta judge at Rome in the trial of the murderers of C\u00e6sar, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted openly for condemnation, and had advised all the others to do the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to expiate the guilt. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius intended to turn Perusia itself over to the soldiers for plunder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut Cestius, one of the citizens, who was somewhat out of his mind, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought in Macedonia and for that reason called himself the Macedonian, set\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfire to his house and plunged into the flames. A strong wind fanned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconflagration and drove it over the whole of Perusia, which was entirely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumed, except the temple of Vulcan. Such was the end of Perusia, a city\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenowned for its antiquity and importance. It is said that it was one of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst twelve cities built by the Etruscans in Italy in the olden time. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reason the worship of Juno prevailed there, as among the Etruscans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally. But thereafter those who shared among themselves the remains of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city took Vulcan for their tutelary deity instead of Juno. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing day Octavius made peace with all of them, but the soldiers did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesist from tumults against some of them until the latter were killed. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere chiefly the personal enemies of Octavius, namely, Canutius, Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlavius, Clodius Bithynicus, and others. Such was the conclusion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsiege of Lucius in Perusia, and thus came to an end a war which had promised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be long-continued and most grievous to Italy. \n\t\t\t\t"},"5":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Asinius, Plancus, Ventidius, Crassus, Ateius, and the others of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty, who had forces not to be despised, numbering about thirteen legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof disciplined \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t LIVIA AS PRIESTESS OF AUGUSTUS \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t From Pompeii, in the Museum at Naples \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t troops and upward of 6500 horse, considering Lucius the chief actor in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar, retired to the sea-coast by various routes, some to Brundusium, some to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRavenna, some to Tarentum, some to Murcus and Ahenobarbus, and still others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Antony.

Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving acquired eleven legions of soldiers and these large provinces by one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstroke, dismissed the chief officers from their commands, substituted his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town, and returned to Rome. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As it was still winter, Antony retained the deputies of the colonized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveterans, who had been sent to him, and concealed his intentions. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspring he set out from Alexandria and proceeded by land to Tyre, and thence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby sea, touching at Cyprus and Rhodes, to the province of Asia. There he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned of the doings at Perusia and he blamed his brother and Fulvia, and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost of all, Manius. He found Fulvia at Athens, whither she had fled from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium. His mother, Julia, who had fled to Pompeius, had been sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthither by him from Sicily with warships, and escorted by some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toptimates of his party, by Lucius Libo, his father-in-law, by Saturninus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers, who, being attracted by Antony's capacity for great deeds, sought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbring him into friendly relations with Pompeius and to form an alliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween them against Octavius. Antony replied that he thanked Pompeius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsending his mother and that he would requite him for the service in due\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime; that if there should be a war with Octavius he would ally himself with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, but that if Octavius should adhere to their agreements he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendeavor to reconcile him with Pompeius. Such was his answer. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius returned from Gaul to Rome he heard about those who had set\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsail for Athens. Not knowing exactly what answer Antony had given them, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan to excite the colonized soldiers against the latter, representing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony intended to bring back Pompeius with the owners of the lands which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers now held, for most of the owners had taken refuge with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius. Although this cause of irritation was plausible, the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not even then take up arms against Antony with any zeal, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treputation he had gained at Philippi having made him popular. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered himself far superior to Antony, to Pompeius, and to Ahenobarbus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the number of troops, as he now had more than forty legions, but as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad no ships and no time to make any, while they had 500, he feared lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should bring famine upon Italy by patrolling the coast. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeditating on those things, and while he had the choice of many virgins in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarriage, he wrote to M\u00e6cenas to make an engagement for him with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScribonia, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sister of Libo, the father-in-law of Pompeius, so that he might have the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans of coming to an arrangement with the latter if need be. When Libo\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard of this he wrote to his family that they should betroth her to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius without delay. Then Octavius, on various pretexts, sent away, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis place and that, such of Antony's friends and soldiers as he could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrust, and he sent Lepidus to Africa, the province assigned to him, and with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim the six of Antony's legions who were under suspicion. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he summoned Lucius to his presence and praised him for his attachment to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this brother, because he had taken the blame upon himself while carrying out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's wishes, but reproached him with ingratitude if, after meeting such\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta favor from himself, he should now refuse to confess concerning the aims of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, who was said to have formed an alliance openly with Pompeius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Having confidence in you,\" he said, \"when Calenus died I took charge of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces and army through my friends for Antony, so that they might not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout a head, but now that the plot is unveiled I shall keep them all for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmyself, and if you wish to go to your brother I will allow you to do so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearlessly.\" He spoke thus, either to test Lucius or in order that what he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid might reach Antony. Lucius replied in the same spirit as before,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying, \"I knew that Fulvia was in favor of the monarchy, but I joined with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther and made use of my brother's soldiers to overthrow all of you. And now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif my brother should come to dissolve the monarchy I would go to join him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither openly or secretly, and would fight you again in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry, although you have been a benefactor to me. If he seeks allies to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist him in maintaining the tyranny, I will fight on your side against him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas long as I think that you are not trying to establish a monarchy. I shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways set my country above gratitude and above family.\" So spake Lucius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, holding him in the same admiration as recently [at Perusia], said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he did not wish to incite him against his brother, but that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrust to Lucius, because he was what he was, the whole of Spain, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy in it, which were now under the command of his lieutenants,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeduc\u00e6us and Lucius. So Octavius dismissed Lucius with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonor, but kept a secret watch upon him by means of his lieutenants. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony left Fulvia ill at Sicyon, and set sail from Corcyra into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinconsiderable army and 200 ships that he had built in Asia. Antony learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Ahenobarbus was coming to meet him with a fleet and a large number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers. Then some of Antony's friends thought that it was not safe to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrust to the agreement exchanged between them, since Ahenobarbus had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondemned at the trial of C\u00e6sar's murderers, and had been placed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the list of the proscribed, and had fought against Antony and Octavius at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe time of the battle of Philippi. Nevertheless, Antony advanced with five of his best\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships in order to seem to have confidence in Ahenobarbus, and he ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers to follow at a certain distance. When Ahenobarbus was observed coming\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward, rowing swiftly, with his whole army and fleet, Plancus, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding by the side of Antony, was alarmed and advised him to check his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse and send a few men forward to make a test, as to a man whose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions were doubtful. Antony replied that he would rather die by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreach of the treaty than to be saved by an appearance of cowardice, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued his course. Now they were drawing near, and the vessels which bore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe chiefs were distinguishable by their ensigns and approached each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's first lictor, who stood on the prow as was customary, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforgetful that Ahenobarbus was a man of doubtful purpose, and that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleading his own forces, or moved by a lofty spirit as though he were meeting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject or inferior men, ordered them to lower their flag. They did so, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid their ship alongside of Antony's. When the two commanders saw each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother they exchanged greetings, and the army of Ahenobarbus saluted Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas imperator. Plancus recovered his courage with difficulty. Antony received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAhenobarbus in his own ship and sailed to Pal\u0153is, where Ahenobarbus had his infantry, and here he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyielded his tent to Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t From thence they sailed to Brundusium, which was garrisoned by five cohorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius' troops. The citizens closed their gates against Ahenobarbus, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan old enemy, and against Antony, as one introducing an enemy. Antony was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindignant. Considering this a pretence, and that he was in fact shut out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' garrison at the latter's instance, he drew a ditch and palisade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross the isthmus that connects the town with the mainland. The city is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated on a peninsula which fronts a crescent-shaped harbor. Now the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople coming from the mainland could no longer reach the rising ground on\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the city stands, as it had been cut off and walled in. Antony also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded the harbor, which is large, and the islands in it, with towers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplanted closely together. He sent forces along the coasts of Italy, whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered to seize the advantageous positions. He called upon Pompeius to move\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Italy with his fleet and to do whatever he could. Pompeius, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\talacrity, despatched Menodorus with a numerous fleet and four legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers, who seized Sardinia, which belonged to Octavius, and two legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin it, who were panic-stricken at this agreement between Pompeius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. In Italy Antony's men captured the town of Sipuntum of Ausonia. Pompeius besieged Thurii and Consentia and ravaged their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterritory with his cavalry. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius, attacked so suddenly and in so many places, sent Agrippa into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAusonia to succor the distressed inhabitants. Agrippa called out the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonized veterans along the road, and they followed at a certain interval,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupposing that they were moving against Pompeius, but when they learned that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat had happened had been done at Antony's instance, they turned around and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent back secretly. Octavius was greatly alarmed by this. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile marching to Brundusium with another army he again fell in with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonized veterans, and interceded with them, and prevailed upon those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been colonized by himself to follow him. They were ashamed to refuse,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut they had the secret intention to bring Antony and Octavius into harmony\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith each other, and if Antony should refuse and should go to war, then to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefend Octavius. The latter was detained some days at Canusium by sickness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough his forces considerably outnumbered those of Antony, he found\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium walled in, and he could do nothing but encamp alongside of it and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tawait events. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony was enabled by means of his intrenchments to defend himself easily,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough he was much inferior in numbers. He summoned his army from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia in haste, and in the meantime he resorted to the stratagem of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsending war-ships and merchant vessels to sea by night secretly with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude of private citizens on board, which returned, one after another,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next day, in sight of Octavius, bearing armed men, as though they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust come from Macedonia. Antony had his machines already prepared and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to attack the Brundusians, to the great chagrin of Octavius, since he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not able to defend them. Toward evening the news reached both armies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Agrippa had captured Sipuntum and that Pompeius had been repulsed from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThurii, but was still besieging Consentia. Antony was disturbed by this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnews. When it was announced that Servilius was coming to the assistance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius with 1500 horse, Antony could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrain his rage, but sprang up from supper, and, with such friends as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould find ready and with 400 horse, he pressed forward with the utmost\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrepidity, and fell upon the 1500, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill asleep near the town of Uria, threw them into a panic, captured them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout a fight, and returned to Brundusium the same day. Thus did the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treputation that Antony had gained at Philippi as an invincible man still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspire terror. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony's pr\u00e6torian cohorts, proud of his prestige, approached the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp of Octavius in groups and reproached their former comrades for coming\n\t\t\t\t\t\thither to fight Antony, to whom they all owed their safety at Philippi. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter replied that the others had come making war against themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey fell to arguing and brought charges against each other. Antony's men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that Brundusium had been closed against him and that Calenus' troops\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been taken from him. The others spoke of the investment and siege of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium, the invasion of Southern Italy, the agreement with Ahenobarbus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of C\u00e6sar's murderers, and the treaty with Pompeius, their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon enemy. Finally Octavius' men revealed their purpose to the others,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying that they had come with Octavius, not because they were forgetful of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's merits, but with the intention of bringing them to an agreement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor, if Antony refused and continued the war, of defending Octavius against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. These things they openly said also when they approached Antony's works.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile these events 'were in progress the news came that Fulvia was dead. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas said that she was dispirited by Antony's reproaches and fell sick; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was thought that she had become a willing victim of disease on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe anger of Antony, who had left her while she was sick and had not visited\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther even when he was going away. The death of this turbulent woman, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstirred up so disastrous a war on account of her jealousy of Cleopatra,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseemed extremely fortunate to both of the parties who were rid of her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, Antony was much saddened by this event because he considered\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself in some sense the cause of it. \n\t\t\t\t"},"6":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t There was a certain Lucius Cocceius, a friend of both, who had been sent, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany with C\u00e6cina, by Octavius, the previous summer, to Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Ph\u0153nicia, and had remained with Antony after C\u00e6cina\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned. This Cocceius, seizing his opportunity, pretended that he had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent for by Octavius for the purpose of a friendly greeting. When Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed him to go he asked, by way of testing his disposition, whether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony would like to write any letter to Octavius which he could convey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony replied: \"What can we write to each other, now that we are enemies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept mutual recrimination? I wrote letters in reply to his of some time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tago, which I sent by the hand of C\u00e6cina. Take copies of those if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou like.\" This he said by way of jest, but Cocceius would not yet allow him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto call Octavius an enemy after his generous behavior toward Lucius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's other friends. But Antony replied: \" He has shut me out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium and taken my provinces and the army of Calenus from me. He is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkind only to my friends, and evidently not to keep them friendly, but to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake them enemies to me by his benefactions.\" Cocceius, after hearing these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplaints, did not care to irritate further a naturally passionate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposition, but proceeded to make his visit to Octavius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius saw him he expressed astonishment that he had not come sooner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I did not save your brother,\" he exclaimed, \"in order that you should be my\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\tCocceius replied, \"How is it that you, who make friends out of enemies, call\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour friends enemies and take from them their armies and provinces?\" \"It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot fitting,\" replied Octavius, \"that after the death of Calenus such large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources should be left in the hands of such a stripling as Calenus' son\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile Antony was still far distant. Lucius was excited to frenzy by them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsinius and Ahenobarbus, who were near by, were about to use them against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus. So, too, I took sudden possession of the legions of Plancus, in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they might not join the Pompeians. His cavalry have actually gone to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily.\" \"These matters have been told differently,\" said Cocceius; \"but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony did not credit the statements made to him until he was shut out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrundusium as an enemy.\" \"I gave no order on that subject,\" replied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, \"nor did I know beforehand that he was coming, nor did I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipate that he would come here with enemies. The Brundusians themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the pr\u00e6fect, who had been left with them on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\traids of Ahenobarbus, of their own motion excluded Antony, who was in league\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the common enemy, Pompeius, and was bringing in Ahenobarbus, one of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather's murderers, who has been condemned by vote of the Senate, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjudgment of the court, and by the proscription, who besieged Brundusium\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the battle of Philippi, and is still blockading the Adriatic coast,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho has burned my ships and plundered Italy.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"But it was agreed between you,\" said Cocceius, \"that you might treat with\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhomsoever you chose. Yet Antony has not made a treaty with any of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers, and he holds your father in no less honor than you do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAhenobarbus was not one of the murderers. The vote was cast against him on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of personal animosity, for he had no share whatever in the plots of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose days. If we consider him unpardonable because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was a friend of Brutus, are we not in a fair way to be bitter against\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost everybody? Antony made an agreement with Pompeius, not to make an\n\t\t\t\t\t\taggressive war with him, but either to secure his help in case of an attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby you, or to bring him into good relations with you, since he has done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing which should make him irreconcilable. You are the one to blame for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things, for if there had been no war in Italy those men would not have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tventured to send ambassadors to Antony.\" Octavius repeated his accusations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying, \" Manius and Fulvia and Lucius brought war against Italy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst me as well as Italy; and Pompeius, who did not attack before, now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes descents upon the coast, encouraged by Antony.\" Cocceius replied, \"Not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged by Antony, but directed by him; for I will not conceal from you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that the rest of Italy, which is destitute of naval defences, will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe attacked by a powerful fleet unless you agree to peace.\" Octavius, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave due weight to this artful suggestion, reflected a moment, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, \"But Pompeius will have the worst of it. He has just been repulsed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Thurii as he deserves.\" Then Cocceius, having gone over the whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontroversy, led the conversation up to the death of Fulvia and the manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it, saying that she fell sick because she could not bear the anger of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and wasted away with grief because he would not see her when she was\n\t\t\t\t\t\till, and that he was in a manner the cause of his wife's death. \"Now that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshe is dead,\" he continued, \"it only remains for you to tell each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrankly what your suspicions are.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way Cocceius won the confidence of Octavius and passed the day as his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguest, and begged him to write to Antony as the younger man to the older.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius said that he would not write to one who was still waging war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him, because Antony had not written to him, but that he would make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplaint to Antony's mother, because, although a relative and held in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighest honor by Octavius, she had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfled from Italy, as though she could not have obtained everything from him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas from her own son. This was his artful way of opening a correspondence \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t OCTAVIA \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Cameo owned by M. le Baron Roger (Duruy) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t by writing to Julia. As Cocceius was going away from the camp many of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher officers advised him of the purpose of the army, and he communicated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis and other things he had learned to Antony, so that he might know that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would fight against him because he did not come to an agreement. So he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvised Antony that Pompeius should be called back from his ravaging to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, and that Ahenobarbus should be sent somewhither until a treaty of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace should be made. Antony's mother besought him to the same purpose, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshe belonged to the Julian gens. Antony apprehended that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif the negotiations should fail he would be put to the shame of calling on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius for assistance again, but his mother encouraged him to believe that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would not fail, and Cocceius confirmed her, intimating that he knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than he had told. So Antony yielded, and ordered Pompeius back to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, implying that he would take care of their mutual concerns, and sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAhenobarbus away as governor of Bithynia. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius' soldiers learned these facts they chose deputies and sent the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame ones to both commanders. They took no notice of accusations because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had been chosen, not to decide a controve sy, but to restore peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCocceius was added to their number as she common friend of both, together\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Pollio from\" Antony's party and M\u00e6cenas from that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. It was determined that there should be amnesty between Antony and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius for the past and friendship for the future. Moreover, as Marcellus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe husband of Octavius' sister Octavia, had recently died, the umpires\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided that her brother should betroth her to Antony, which he did\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately. Then Antony and Octavius embraced each other. Thereupon shouts\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent up from the soldiers and congratulations were offered to each of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals, without intermission, through the entire day and night. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Octavius and Antony made a fresh partition of the whole Roman empire\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween themselves, the boundary line being Scodra, a city of Illyria which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas supposed to be situated about midway up the Adriatic gulf. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll provinces aid islands east of this place, as far as the river Euphrates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere to belong to Antony and all west of it to the ocean to Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus was to govern Africa, as Octavius had given it to him. Octavius was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make war against Pompeius unless they should come to some agreement, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony was to make war against the Parthians to avenge their treachery\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward Crassus. Octavius was to make the same agreement with Ahenobarbus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Antony had already made. Both of them might freely enlist soldiers in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly in equal numbers. These were the last conditions of peace between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Antony. Straightway each of them sent his friends to attend to\n\t\t\t\t\t\turgent business. Antony despatched Ventidius to Asia against the Parthians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand against Labienus, the son of Labienus, who, with the Parthians, had made\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta hostile incursion into Syria and had advanced as far as Ionia during the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate troubles. What Labienus and the Parthians did and suffered I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill show in my Parthian history. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime Helenus, a lieutenant of Octavius, who had repossessed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSardinia by a sudden onset, was driven out again by Menodorus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlieutenant of Pompeius. Octavius was so exasperated by this that he rejected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's endeavors to bring him to an agreement with Pompeius. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeded to Rome together and celebrated the marriage. Antony put Manius to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath because he had excited Fulvia by his accusations against Cleopatra and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been the cause of so many evils. He also revealed to Octavius the fact\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Salvidienus, who was in command of Octavius' army on the Rhone, had had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe intention of deserting him, and had sent word to that effect to Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was besieging Brundusium. This secret Antony revealed, not with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuniversal approbation, but because of his frankness and eagerness to show\n\t\t\t\t\t\this good-will. Octavius instantly summoned Salvidienus to Rome, pretending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he had some private communication to make to him, and that he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsend him back to the army. When he came Octavius confronted him with proofs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his treachery and put him to death, and gave his army to Antony, as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered it untrustworthy. \n\t\t\t\t"},"7":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now famine fell upon Rome, since the merchants of the Orient could not put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea for fear of Pompeius, who controlled Sicily, and those of the west were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeterred by Sardinia and Corsica, which the lieutenants of Pompeius held,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile those of Africa opposite were prevented by the same hostile fleets,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich infested both shores. There was great dearness of provisions, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople considered the cause of it to be the strife between the chiefs, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcried out against them and urged them to make peace with Pompeius. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius would by no means yield, Antony advised him to hasten the war on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the scarcity. As there was no money for this purpose, an edict\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas published that the owners of slaves should pay a tax for each one, equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto one-half of the twenty-five drachmas that had been ordained for the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst Brutus and Cassius, and that those who acquired property by legacies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould contribute a share thereof. The people tore down the edict with fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey were exasperated that, after exhausting the public treasury, stripping\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe provinces, burdening Italy itself with contributions, taxes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfiscations, not for foreign war, not for extending the empire, but for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate enmities and to add to their own power (for which reason the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscriptions and this terrible famine had come about), the triumvirs should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprive them of the remainder of their property. They banded together, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloud cries, and stoned those who did not join them, and threatened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplunder and burn their houses, until the whole populace was aroused. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius with his friends and a few attendants came into the forum intending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto intercede with the people and to show the unreasonableness of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplaints. As soon as he made his appearance they stoned him unmercifully,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand they were not ashamed when they saw him enduring this treatment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpatiently, and offering himself to it, and even bleeding from wounds. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony learned what was going on he came with haste to his assistance. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people saw him coming down the Via Sacra they did not throw stones at\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, since he was in favor of a treaty with Pompeius, but they told him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo away. When he refused to do so they stoned him also. He called in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger force of troops, who were outside the walls. As the people would not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow him to pass through, the soldiers divided right and left on either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the street and the forum, and made their attack from the narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlane, striking down those whom they met. The people could no longer find\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready escape on account of the crowd, nor was there any way out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum. There was a scene of slaughter and wounds, while shrieks and groans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsounded from the housetops. Antony made his way into the forum with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty, and snatched Octavius from the most manifest danger, in which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen was, and brought him safe to his house. The mob having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen dispersed, the corpses were thrown into the river in order to avoid a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshocking spectacle. It was a fresh cause of lamentation to see them floating\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown the stream, and the soldiers stripping them, and certain miscreants, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as the soldiers, carrying off the clothing of the better class as their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town property. This insurrection was suppressed, but with terror and hatred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the triumvirs. The famine grew worse. The people groaned, but did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstir. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony suggested to the relatives of Libo that they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsummon him from Sicily for the purpose of congratulating his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother-in-law, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplish something more important; and he promised him a safe-conduct. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatives wrote promptly and Pompeius acquiesced. Libo, on his arrival, cast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanchor at the isle of Pithecusa, which is now called \u00c6naria. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople learned this, they assembled together again and besought Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith tears to send letters of safeguard to Libo, who desired to negotiate\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him for peace. He did so reluctantly. The people also threatened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburn Mucia, the mother of Pompeius, with her house, if she did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunicate with her son in the interest of peace. When Libo perceived that\n\t\t\t\t\t\this enemies were on the point of yielding, he demanded that the leaders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves should come together in order to make such concessions to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother as they could agree upon. The people compelled them to this course,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, accordingly, Octavius and Antony went to Bai\u00e6. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t All the friends of Pompeius urged him with one accord to make peace, except\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus, who wrote to him from Sardinia either to prosecute the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvigorously or still to procrastinate, because famine was fighting for them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he would thus get better terms if he should decide to make peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus also advised him to distrust Murcus, who opposed these views,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintimating that he was seeking power for himself. Pompeius, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvexed with Murcus lately on account of his high position and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstubbornness, became still more averse to him for this reason, and held no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunication with him whatever, until, finally, Murcus retired in disgust\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Syracuse. Here he saw some of Pompeius' guards following him, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpressed his opinion of Pompeius to them freely. Then Pompeius bribed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune and a centurion of Murcus, and induced them to kill him and to say\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he had been murdered by slaves. To give credibility to this falsehood\n\t\t\t\t\t\the crucified the slaves. But he did not succeed in concealing this crime, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next one committed by him after the murder of Bithynicus, -- Murcus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving been a man distinguished for his warlike deeds, who had been strongly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattached to that party from the beginning, and had rendered great assistance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Pompeius in Spain, and had joined him in Sicily voluntarily. Such was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath of Murcus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t His other friends urged Pompeius to make peace, and they accused Menodorus of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfondness of power and as opposing peace not so much from good-will to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster as from a desire to command an army and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince. Pompeius yielded and set sail for \u00c6naria with a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of his best ships, having embarked himself on a magnificent one with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix banks of oars. In this style, toward evening, he sailed proudly past\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPuteoli in sight of his enemies. Early in the morning two sets of piles were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven in the sea a short distance apart, and planks were placed upon them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpon the platform nearest the shore Octavius and Antony took their places,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile Pompeius and Libo occupied the seaward one, a small space of water\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseparating them, but not preventing them from hearing each other without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouting. As Pompeius thought that he had come in order to be admitted to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of the government in place of Lepidus, while the others would concede\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing but his recall from exile, they separated for the time without\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplishing anything. Nevertheless, negotiations were continued on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of friends, who advanced various proposals from one side to the other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius demanded that, of the proscripts and the men with him, those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad participated in the murder of Gaius C\u00e6sar should be allowed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafe place of exile, and the rest an honorable recall to their homes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the property they had lost should be restored to them. Urged on by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine and by the people to an agreement, Octavius and Antony reluctantly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconceded a fourth part of this property, promising to buy it from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent holders. They wrote to this effect to the proscripts themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thoping that this would satisfy them. The latter accepted all the terms, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey already had apprehensions of Pompeius on account of his crime against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMurcus. So they gathered around Pompeius and besought him to come to an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreement. Pompeius rent his garments, declaring that he had been betrayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby those for whom he had fought, and he frequently invoked the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus as his most competent officer and his only friend. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally, at the instance of his mother, Mucia, and of his wife, Julia, again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe three men (Octavius, Antony, and Pompeius) came together on the mole of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPuteoli, washed by the waves on both sides, and with ships moored around it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas guards. Here they came to an agreement on the following terms: That the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar should cease on both land and sea, and that commerce should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverywhere unmolested; that Pompeius should remove his garrisons from Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand no longer afford a refuge to fugitive slaves; that he should not assail\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith his fleet the Italian coast, but should govern Sardinia, Sicily, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCorsica, and any other islands then in his possession, as long as Antony and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius should hold sway over the other countries; that he should send to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome the corn that had been previously required as tribute from those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tislands, and that he might have Peloponnesus in addition; that he might hold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship in his absence through any friend he might choose, and be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinscribed as a member of the priesthood of the first rank. Such were the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions accorded to Pompeius himself. Members of the nobility who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill in exile were allowed to return, except those who had been condemned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby vote of the Senate and judgment of court for participation in the murder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Gaius C\u00e6sar. The property of those who had fled merely from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear, and whose goods had been seized by violence, should all be restored\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept movables. Proscripts should receive one fourth part of theirs. Slaves\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had served in the army of Pompeius should be free, and free persons who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad thus served should, upon their discharge, receive the same rewards as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who had served under Octavius and Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such were the terms of the treaty, to which they attached their names and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseals and sent it to Rome to be placed in the custody of the Vestal virgins.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThen they entertained each other, casting lots to determine the order of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tceremony. The first banquet took place on Pompeius' six-banked ship, moored\n\t\t\t\t\t\talongside the mole. On succeeding days Antony and Octavius gave banquets in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttents pitched on the mole, on the pretext that thus all might participate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut perhaps really for their better security and to quiet apprehensions; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey did not even then neglect precautions. Their ships were moored\n\t\t\t\t\t\talongside and guards were stationed around them, and the banqueters were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgirded with concealed daggers. It is said that, while the three were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeasting in the ship, Menodorus sent a message to Pompeius advising him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrap these men and avenge the wrongs of his father and his brother, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavail himself of this most favorable occasion to resume the sway that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather had exercised, saying that he, with his own ships, would take care\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nobody should escape; but that Pompeius replied, in a manner worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this family and his position, \"Would that Menodorus had done this without my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge. False swearing may become Menodorus, but not Pompeius.\" At this banquet the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Pompeius and granddaughter of Libo was betrothed to Marcellus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stepson of Antony and nephew of Octavius. On the following day they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignated the consuls for the next four years, viz., for the first year\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and Libo, Antony being privileged to substitute whomsoever he liked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his own place; next Octavius and Pompeius; next Ahenobarbus and Sossius;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, finally, Antony and Octavius again; and as they would then have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls the third time it was expected that they would restore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment to the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Having finished this business they separated, Pompeius \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t SEXTUS POMPEIUS \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Museum of the Louvre (Duruy) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t going to Sicily by sea, Octavius and Antony to Rome by land.

Desiring to enrich as well as to exercise the soldiers, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto go with him into winter quarters, he sent some of them against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPartheni, an Illyrian tribe near Epidamnus, who had been very much attached\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Brutus; others against the Dardani, another Illyrian tribe, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforever making.incursions into Macedonia.

There was straightway a crowd around his doors composed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlictors, army officers, guards, and all things that inspire terror and awe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmbassies were received which had previously been kept waiting by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders, lawsuits were decided, ships were launched, and all other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations for the campaign were put in motion. \n\t\t\t\t"},"8":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While Antony was thus occupied the treaty existing beween Octavius and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius was broken for other reasons, as was suspected, than those avowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Octavius, which were the following: Antony had ceded Peloponnesus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius on condition that the tribute then due from the Peloponnesians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould either be given over at once, or that it should be guaranteed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius to Antony, or that the former should wait till the collection had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen made. Pompeius had not accepted it on these conditions. He thought that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had been given to him with the amount of tribute then due. Vexed, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius said, whether at this state of things, or from his general\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaithlessness, or his jealousy because the others had large armies, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Menodorus had prompted him to consider the agreement as a truce\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than a lasting peace, he began to build ships, and recruit crews, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce harangued his soldiers, telling them they must be prepared for\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything. Private robbery again infested the sea, and there was little or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno relief from the famine among the Romans, who cried out that the treaty\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad brought no deliverance from their sufferings, but only a fourth partner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the tyranny. Octavius having caught certain pirates and put them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttorture, they said that Pompeius had sent them out, and Octavius proclaimed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis to the people and wrote it to Pompeius himself, who disavowed it and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a counter complaint respecting the Peloponnesus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Those of the nobility who were still with Pompeius, seeing him always under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe influence of his freedmen, bribed some of them, either for their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposes or to gratify Octavius, to incite their master against Menodorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was still governing Corsica and Sardinia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe freedmen did this gladly, because they were envious of the power of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus. In this way Pompeius was brought to an estrangement with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus. About the same time Philadelphus, a freedman of Octavius, made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoyage to Menodorus to procure corn, and Micylio, the closest friend of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus, visited Octavius to arrange for the desertion of Menodorus. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter promised to hand over to him Sardinia, Corsica, three legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers, and a large number of light-armed troops. Whether this was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork of Philadelphus, or was a consequence of the calumnies against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenodorus, which Pompeius had listened to, Octavius accepted the offer, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately, but soon, since he considered the peace broken in fact. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvited Antony to come from Athens and meet him at Brundusium on an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed day, in order to take counsel with him about the war. At the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime he brought war-ships from Ravenna and an army from Gaul, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of his apparatus, rapidly to Brundusium and Puteoli, intending to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsail from both sides of Italy to Sicily if Antony should agree in opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Antony came at the appointed day with a small escort, but not finding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius there he did not wait, either because he did not approve of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar, considering it a violation of the treaty, or because he observed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' great preparations (for the desire to be the sole ruler did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpermit their fears to slumber at any time), or because he was alarmed by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprodigy. 'It was found that one of the guards who slept around his tent had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen devoured by wild beasts except his face only, as though this had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft for the purpose of recognition, and that he had uttered no cry, nor did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany of those who were asleep with him know of it. The Brundusians said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta wolf had been seen just before daybreak running away from the tents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless Antony wrote to Octavius not to violate the treaty, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatened Menodorus with punishment as his own fugitive slave; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter had been the slave of Pompey the Great, whose property Antony had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbought when it was sold under the law of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius sent officers to receive Sardinia and Corsica, which Menodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturned over to them. He strengthened the Italian coast with numerous towers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto prevent Pompeius from raiding it again. He ordered the building of new\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriremes at Rome and Ravenna, and he sent for a large army from Illyria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Menodorus came he made the latter a free citizen instead of a freedman,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand put him in command, under the admiral Calvisius, of the ships which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad brought with him. When he had finished these preparations and brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether a still larger amount of war material he yet delayed, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproached Antony for not waiting. He ordered Cornificius to bring with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Tarentum everything that was now in readiness. While Cornificius was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking the voyage a storm overtook him which destroyed only the admiral's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tship, which had been built for Octavius himself. This was considered an omen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof what was to take place. As the belief still prevailed that this war was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolation of the treaty, Octavius sought to dispel the suspicion. He wrote\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the city and he told his soldiers that Pompeius had violated the treaty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby encouraging piracy, that the pirates had confessed this, that Menodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad revealed the whole design, and that Antony knew it, and for that reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad refused to give up the Peloponnesus. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When all things were in readiness he set sail for Sicily, going himself from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTarentum, while Calvisius, with Sabinus and Menodorus, sailed from Etruria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe infantry was sent on the march to Rhegium and great haste was displayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all quarters. Pompeius had scarcely heard of the desertion of Menodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Octavius was already moving against him. While the hostile fleets were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvancing from both sides, he awaited the attack of Octavius at Messana, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered his freedman Menecrates, who was the bitterest enemy of Menodorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto advance against Calvisius and Menodorus with a large fleet. Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas observed by his enemies near nightfall on the open sea. They retired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the bay near Cum\u00e6, where they passed the night, Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeding to \u00c6naria. At daybreak they drew up their fleet, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tform of a crescent, as close to the shore as possible, in order to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy from breaking through it. Menecrates again showed himself, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately came on with a rush. As his enemies would not advance to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topen sea, and he could do nothing of importance there, he made a charge in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to drive them upon the land. They beached their ships and fought back\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the attacking prows. Menecrates had the opportunity to draw off and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenew the attack as he pleased, and to bring up fresh ships by turns, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy were distressed by the rocks, on which they had grounded, and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inability to move. They were like infantry contending against sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces, unable either to pursue or retreat. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this situation Menodorus and Menecrates came in sight of each other; and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoning the rest of the fight, drove against each other with fury and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouting, as though they had staked the issue of the battle on this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencounter, whichever should be the victor. Their ships came into violent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollision and were badly damaged, Menodorus losing his prow and Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\this oar-blades. Grapplingirons were thrown by both, and the ships, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfastened together, could no longer man\u0153uvre, but the men, as in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle on land, failed not in deeds of valor. Showers of javelins, stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand arrows were discharged, and bridges for boarding were thrown from one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tship to the other. As the ship of Menodorus was higher than the other his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbridges made a better passageway for his daring crew, and his missiles were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore effective for the same reason. Many men were already slain, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder wounded, when Menodorus was pierced in the arm with a dart, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas, however, drawn out. Menecrates was struck in the thigh with a Spanish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjavelin, made wholly of iron with numerous barbs, which could not be readily\n\t\t\t\t\t\textracted. Although Menecrates could no longer take part in the fight, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained there all the same, encouraging the others, until his ship was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured, when he plunged into the depths of the sea. Menodorus towed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured ship to the land, but was able to do nothing more himself. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This took place on the left wing of the naval fight. Calvisius directed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse from the right to the left and cut off some of Menecrates' ships from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe main body, and when they fled pursued them to the open sea. Demochares,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was a fellow-freedman of Menecrates and his lieutenant, fell upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of Calvisius' ships, put some of them to flight, broke others in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpieces on the rocks, and set fire to them after the crews had abandoned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Finally Calvisius, returning from the pursuit, led back his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleeing ships and prevented the burning of any more. As night was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching, all returned to their former station. Such was the end of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnaval fight, in which the forces of Pompeius had much the best of it; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemochares, grieving over the death of Menecrates as the greatest possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeat (for those two, Menecrates and Menodorus, had been the foremost of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius' sea captains), abandoned everything and sailed for Sicily\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately, mediately, as though he had lost not merely the body of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMenecrates and one ship, but his whole, fleet. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Calvisius, as long as he expected that Demochares would renew his attack,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at his station, unable to fight in the open sea, for his best ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been destroyed and the others were unfit for battle. When he learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat his antagonist had gone to Sicily, he repaired his ships and coasted\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong the shore exploring the bays. Octavius, in the meantime, proceeded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Tarentum to Rhegium, with a large fleet and army, and near Messana came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup with Pompeius, who had forty ships only. Octavius' friends advised him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprove this most favorable opportunity and attack Pompeius with his great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet, while the latter had so few ships and before the rest of his naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce should arrive. He did not follow this advice, but waited for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCalvisius, saying that it was not good policy to run a risk when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpecting reinforcements. When Demochares arrived at Messana, Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed him and Apollophanes, another of his freedmen, admirals in place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Menodorus and Menecrates. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius heard of his disaster at Cum\u00e6 he sailed out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraits to meet Calvisius. After accomplishing the greater part of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance and while he was passing Stylis and turning into Scyll\u00e6um, Pompeius darted out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Messana and fell upon his rear, pushed on to his front, attacked him all\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong the line, and challenged him to fight. Although beset in this way,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' fleet did not give battle, since Octavius did not permit it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither because he feared to fight in the straits or because he adhered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this first determination not to fight without Calvisius. He gave orders,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, that all should hug the shore, cast anchor, and defend themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their prows toward the enemy. Demochares,by setting two of his ships by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturns against one of the enemy's, threw them into confusion. They dashed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the rocks and against each other, and began to fill with water. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso these ships were lost, like those at Cum\u00e6, without striking a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblow, being stuck fast and battered by the enemy, who had freedom of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovement to advance and retreat. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius leaped from his ship upon the rocks and pulled out of the water\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who swam ashore, and conducted them to the mountain above. However,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornificius and the other generals who were there, encouraged each other,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcut loose from their anchors without awaiting orders, and put to sea against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy, thinking that it was better to be conquered fighting than to fall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunresisting before the blows of their assailants. First, with wonderful\n\t\t\t\t\t\taudacity, Cornificius rammed the flag-ship of Demochares and captured it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter leaped upon another vessel. Then, while the struggle and carnage\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in progress, Calvisius and Menodorus hove in sight, advancing from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topen sea, although they had not been observed by Octavius' men either from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land or the water. The Pompeians, being farther out at sea, beheld them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst, and, when they saw them, retreated, for darkness was approaching,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, fatigued as they were, they dared not encounter fresh men. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconjuncture happened very opportunely for those who had just now been in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At nightfall, those who had reached the shore from the ships took refuge on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mountains and lighted numerous fires as signals to those who were still\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the sea, and there passed the night without food, uncared for, and in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant of everything. Octavius fared like the rest, and moved around exhorting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to endure their privations till morning. While he was undergoing these\n\t\t\t\t\t\thardships it was not known that Calvisius had arrived, nor could anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing needful be obtained from the ships in their wrecked condition. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood luck came to them from another quarter. The thirteenth legion was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching by way of the mountains, and, learning of the disaster and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjudging of the road by the fire, they made their way through the crags. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound their commander, and those who had taken refuge with him, suffering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom fatigue and want of food, and ministered to them, dividing the work,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome caring for some, others for others. The centurions brought their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommander into an improvised tent, as none of his body-servants were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent, these having been dispersed in the darkness and disorder. He sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessengers in all directions forthwith, to announce that he was safe, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearned that Calvisius had arrived with the vanguard of his fleet; and, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of these two helpful and unexpected events, he allowed himself some\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest. \n\t\t\t\t"},"9":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The next morning, when Octavius looked out upon the water, he beheld some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this ships burned, others partly burned, others still burning, and others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroken in pieces; and the sea filled with sails, rudders, and furniture,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile, of the ships that were saved, the greater part were damaged. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tranged the fleet of Calvisius in front, he made repairs on those of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvessels that most needed them, turning them on their sides, the enemy meantime remaining quiet, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they feared Calvisius, or because they had decided to attack again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the open sea. Thus they remained on either side until midday, when a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth wind burst upon them, raising violent billows in that surging and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfined channel. Pompeius was then inside the harbor of Messana. The ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius were again shattered on the rough and inhospitable coast,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdashing against the rocks and against each other, for, as they were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfully manned, they were not under good control. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Menodorus, apprehending that this rising storm would increase in violence,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoved farther seaward and rode at anchor where, on account of the depth of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater, the waves were less boisterous; and even here he had recourse to hard\n\t\t\t\t\t\trowing to avoid being driven ashore. Some of the others followed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\texample, but most of them, thinking that the wind would soon subside, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tusually did in the springtime, moored themselves with anchors on either\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside, landward and seaward, and thrust out poles to prevent collisions with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other. As the wind grew more violent everything was thrown into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfusion. The ships collided, broke their anchors, and were upset on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshore one after another. Cries of alarm and groans of pain were mingled\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether, and exhortations that fell upon deaf ears. Orders could not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\theard. There was no distinction between pilot and common sailor. Knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand authority were alike unavailing. The same destruction awaited those in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ships and those who fell overboard, the latter being crushed by wind,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaves, and floating timber. The sea was full of sails, spars, and men,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliving and dead. Those who sought to escape by swimming to land were dashed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the rocks by the surf. When the convulsion seized the water, as is usual in that strait, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere terrified, being unaccustomed to it, and then their vessels were\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhirled around and dashed against each other worse than ever. As night came\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the wind increased in fury, so that they perished no longer in the light\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut in the darkness. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Groans were heard throughout the entire night, and the cries of men running\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong the shore and calling their friends and relatives upon the sea by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname, and mourning for them as lost when they could hear no responses; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanon the cries of others lifting their heads above the waves and beseeching\n\t\t\t\t\t\taid from those on shore. Nothing' could be done on either land or water. Not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly was the sea inexorable to those engulfed in it, as well as to those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill in the ships, but the danger from the storm was almost as great on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland, lest the surf should dash them against the rocks. So distressed were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey by this unexampled tempest that those who were nearest the land feared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land, yet could not get sufficient offing to avoid collision with each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother, for the narrowness of the place and its naturally difficult outlet,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with the force of the waves, the rotary motion of the wind, caused\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the surrounding mountains, and the whirlpool of the deep, holding\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything in its grasp, allowed neither tarrying nor escape. The darkness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a very black night added to their distress. And so they perished, no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger even seeing each other, some uttering confused cries, others yielding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin silence, accepting their doom, some even hastening it, believing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were utterly lost. The disaster so far surpassed their experience that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit bereft them of the hope of saving themselves even by chance. Finally, at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe approach of daylight, the wind suddenly relaxed its force, and after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsunrise wholly died away; yet even then, although the storm had ceased, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurges rolled a long time. The fury of the tempest surpassed the memory of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oldest inhabitants. It was altogether unexampled, and the greater part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius' ships and men were destroyed by it. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius, who had lost heavily in the battle the previous day and had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained two severe calamities together, took the road in haste to Vibo\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat same night, by way of the mountains, being unable to repair this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster, for which there was no help at hand. He wrote to all his friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand generals to be on the alert lest a plot should be formed against him\n\t\t\t\t\t\there or there, as is liable to be the case when adversity comes. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespatched the infantry he had with him to all points on the Italian coast,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlest Pompeius should be emboldened by his good luck even to invade the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainland. But the latter had no thought of an expedition by land. He did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven attack the ships that were left from the wreck, nor those that went\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway after the storm had subsided. On the contrary, he paid no attention to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy while they were tying their ships together with ropes as well as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey could, and sailing with a favorable wind to Vibo. He neglected them\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither because he thought that the disaster was all-sufficient for him, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he did not know how to follow up a victory, or, as I have said\n\t\t\t\t\t\telsewhere, because he was altogether inefficient in attack and cared only to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefend himself against assailants. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Less than half of Octavius' ships were saved, and these badly damaged. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft certain officers in charge of them and proceeded to Campania much cast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown, for he had no other ships and he needed many; nor did he have time to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuild them, pressed as he was by the famine and by the people, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain harassing him about a new treaty and mocking at the war as being in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolation of the old one. He needed money, but had none. The Romans were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaying the taxes, nor would they allow the use of the revenues that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevised. But he was always clever at discovering what was for his advantage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe sent \n\t\t\t\t\t\tM\u00e6cenas to Antony to change the mind of the latter respecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t the things about which they had lately had some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbickering, and to bring him to an alliance. If M\u00e6cenas should not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsucceed, he intended to embark his infantry on merchant vesels, cross over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Sicily, abandon the sea, and wage war on land. While in this state of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdejection the news reached him that Antony had agreed to the alliance, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\the heard of a splendid victory over the Gauls of Aquitania, gained under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership of Agrippa. His friends and certain cities also promised him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships, and built them. Accordingly, Octavius cast off his despondency, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade more formidable preparations than his previous ones. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t At the beginning of spring, Antony set sail from Athens to Tarentum with 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships to assist Octavius as he had promised. But the latter had changed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmind and postponed his movement until his own ships should be finished. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled upon again and told that Antony's forces were ready and sufficient,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the advanced other reasons for delay. It was evident that he was again\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffended with Antony about something, or that he disdained his assistance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause his own resources were abundant. Antony was vexed, but he remained,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless, and communicated with Octavius again, because the expense of his fleet\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas burdensome. Moreover, he needed Italian soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor his war against the Parthians, and he contemplated exchanging his fleet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a part of Octavius' army; for, although it was provided in their treaty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat each of them might recruit soldiers in Italy, it would be difficult for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to do so when Italy had fallen to the lot of Octavius. Accordingly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavia betook herself to her brother to act as mediator between them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius complained that he had been abandoned by Antony when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tovertaken by danger in the straits. She replied that that had been explained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough M\u00e6cenas. Octavius said that Antony had sent his freedman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCallias to Lepidus in Africa to induce the latter to make an alliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst him. She replied that she knew that Callias had been sent to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements about a marriage, because Antony desired, before setting out on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this Parthian expedition, to marry his daughter to the son of Lepidus, as had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen agreed. After Octavia had made this statement Antony sent Callias to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius with permission to put him to torture [in order to learn the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttruth]. Octavius would not receive him, but said that he would go and have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan interview with Antony between Metapontum and Tarentum, at a place where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a river of the latter name between them. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t They both chanced to reach the river at the same time. Antony sprang down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom his chariot and leaped alone into one of the skiffs moored near by, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trowed toward Octavius, showing confidence in him as a friend. When Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw this he followed the example. So they met in the stream and contended\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith each other which of them should disembark on the other's bank. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevailed because he was going to make a visit to Octavia at Tarentum. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook a seat with Antony in the latter's chariot, and proceeded to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlodgings at Tarentum unprotected, and passed the night there without guards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the following day Antony made the same exhibition of trust. Thus they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere continually changing from suspicion born of rivalry to confidence due\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto their mutual needs. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Octavius postponed his expedition against Pompeius till the following year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn account of the Parthian war Antony was not able to wait. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey made an exchange with each other, Antony giving to Octavius 120 ships,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he sent at once and delivered at Tarentum, in return for which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius promised to send him 20,000 Italian legionaries. Octavia, begging\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe favor from Antony, made her brother a present of ten three-banked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphaseli -- a combination of war-ship and merchant vessel -- and Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave her in return 1000 picked men as a body-guard, to be selected by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. As the term of the triumvirate voted to them was about expiring,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey renewed it for five years without again asking the people. And so they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseparated, Antony proceeding straightway to Syria and leaving Octavia with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther brother, and also a daughter already born to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t But Menodorus, -- either because he was an habitual traitor, or because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared the former threat of Antony, who had said that he would punish him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta rebellious slave, or because he had received less consideration than he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad expected, or because the other freedmen of Pompeius were continually\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproaching him for unfaithfulness to his master and urging him to return,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-- now that Menecrates was dead, asked forgiveness, and, having obtained it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserted to Pompeius with seven ships, without the knowledge of Octavius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmiral, Calvisius. For this reason Octavius dismissed the latter from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand and appointed Agrippa in his place. When the fleet was ready,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius performed a lustration for it in the following manner. Altars were\n\t\t\t\t\t\terected on the margin of the sea, and the multitude were ranged around them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin ships, observing the most profound silence. The priests who performed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tceremony offered the sacrifice while standing at the water's edge, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried the expiatory offerings in skiffs three times around the fleet, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral sailing with them, beseeching the gods to turn the bad omens against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe victims instead of the fleet. Then, dividing the entrails, they cast a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of them into the sea, and put the remainder on the altars and burned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, while the multitude chanted in unison. In this way the Romans perform\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlustrations of the fleet. \n\t\t\t\t"},"10":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t It was intended that Octavius should set sail from Puteoli, Lepidus from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, and Taurus from Tarentum, to Sicily, in order to surround the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat once, from the east, the west, and the south. The day of Octavius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailing had been previously communicated to all. It was the tenth day after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summer solstice. This, in the Roman calendar, was the calends of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth which, in honor of the first C\u00e6sar, they call July instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Quintilis. Octavius fixed on this day, perhaps because he considered it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropitious on account of his father, who was always victorious. Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed Plennius at Lilyb\u00e6um with one legion and a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of light-armed troops, to oppose Lepidus. He guarded the whole coast of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, both east and west, and especially the islands of Lipara and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCossyra, lest they should become convenient harbors and naval stations for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Lepidus against Sicily. The best part of his naval force he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkept together at Messana watching its chances. In this way they made their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations on either side. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the calends came they all set sail at daybreak, Lepidus from Africa with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1000 ships of burden, seventy war vessels, twelve legions of soldiers, 500\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumidian horse, and a great quantity of apparatus; Taurus from Tarentum with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly 102 of the 130 ships that Antony had left, since the oarsmen of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder had perished during the winter. Octavius sailed from Puteoli,\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffering sacrifices and pouring out libations from the admiral's ship into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe water to the propitious winds, and to Neptune, the guardian, and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranquil sea, that they should be his assistants against his father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Certain ships sent in advance made examination of the bays, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAppius with a large squadron followed as a rear guard. On the third day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter their departure a south wind blew with violence and capsized a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of ships of burden belonging to Lepidus. Nevertheless, he reached the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicilian coast, laid siege to Plennius in Lilyb\u00e6um, and got\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of some towns by persuasion and others by force. When the wind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan to blow Taurus returned to Tarentum. While Appius was doubling the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromontory of Minerva, some of his ships were shattered against the rocks,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers ran with violence on the shoals, and the rest were dispersed, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout injury. At the beginning of the storm, Octavius took refuge in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheltered bay of Elea, except one six-banked ship, which was wrecked on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromontory. The south wind was succeeded by a southwester, which threw the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbay into commotion, as it opened toward the west. It was impossible to sail\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of the bay with the wind still ahead, nor could the ships be held by\n\t\t\t\t\t\toars or anchors. They crashed against each other or against the rocks, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe confusion became worse confounded by night. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the tempest had subsided, Octavius buried the dead, cared for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounded, clothed those who had swum ashore and furnished them with new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweapons, and repaired his whole fleet with the means at his command. Six of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this heavy ships, twenty-six lighter ones, and a still larger number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliburnicas had been destroyed. He was likely to consume nearly thirty days\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin these repairs; and now the end of summer was approaching, for which\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason he deemed it best to postpone the war till the following summer, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the people were suffering from scarcity he drew his ships upon the land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand made his preparations rapidly, and sent the crews of the ships that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad lost to fill the empty ones in the fleet of Taurus. In anticipation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore serious misfortune he sent M\u00e6cenas to Rome on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were still under the spell of the memory of Pompey the Great, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fame of that man had not yet lost its influence over them. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself visited the new colonies throughout Italy and dispelled their fears,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been excited by the recent events. He also went to Tarentum and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspected the naval force under Taurus. Thence he proceeded to Vibo, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\the encouraged his infantry and hastened the preparations of his fleet, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime for his second invasion of Sicily being near at hand. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius did not deign to seize the fine opportunity presented to him by so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany shipwrecks. He merely offered sacrifice to the sea and to Neptune,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassuming to call himself their son, and persuading himself that it was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout the special act of Providence that his enemies had been twice\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverwhelmed in this way in the summer months. It is said that he was so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpuffed up by these circumstances that he exchanged the purple cloak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary to Roman commanders for a dark blue one, to signify that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe adopted son of Neptune. He hoped that Octavius would now desist from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertaking, but when he learned that the latter was building ships and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to renew the expedition against him that summer, he became alarmed at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinding himself at war with a man of such indomitable spirit and such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformidable preparations. He sent Menodorus, with the seven ships he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought, to reconnoitre the dockyards of Octavius and to do whatever damage\n\t\t\t\t\t\the could. Menodorus had been vexed for some time past because the naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand had not been given to him, and he now perceived that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrusted with only the ships that he had brought, because he was under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspicion. So he plotted a new desertion. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Conceiving that, however matters might turn out, he should first signalize\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself by some act of valor, he distributed among his companions all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgold he had, and sailed, by rowing three days, accomplishing a distance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1500 stades, and fell like a thunderbolt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunperceived, on the vessels that were guarding Octavius' shipyards, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdarted away to an unseen place carrying off the guard-ships by twos and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrees. He also sunk, or captured, or burned some merchant vessels, laden\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith corn, that were moored there or sailing along the coast. Everything was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrown into confusion by this raid of Menodorus, both Octavius and Agrippa\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing absent. The latter had gone away to procure timber. In a spirit of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbravado Menodorus ran his ship upon the soft ground, voluntarily and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontemptuously, and pretended to be stuck in the mud, until his enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdashed down from the mountains as to a certain prey, when he backed away,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaughing, and left the soldiers of Octavius the victims of both chagrin and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tastonishment. When he had sufficiently shown what he was capable of, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy or friend, he dismissed a senator whom he had taken prisoner, named\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRebillus, having a view already to the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t During his former desertion he had been a friend of Mindius Marcellus, one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe companions of Octavius, and he now told his own men that Mindius had the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintention of betraying his party and deserting to that of Pompeius. Then he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrew near to the enemy and invited Mindius to go with him to a small island\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to have a conference. When the latter came, and there was nobody\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse within earshot, Menodorus said that he had gone back to Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he was ill-treated by the admiral of those days, Calvisius, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince Agrippa had been appointed to the command of the fleet he would come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback to Octavius, who had done him no wrong, if Mindius would bring him a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafe-conduct from Messala, who was commanding in Agrippa's absence. He said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat on his return he would make amends for his fault by brilliant exploits,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut that until the safe-conduct arrived he should be obliged to harass the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces of Octavius as before in order to avoid suspicion; and this he did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMessala hesitated on account of the baseness of the transaction, but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless yielded, either because he considered such things necessary in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar, or because he had learned beforehand, or conjectured, the mind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius. Menodorus at once deserted, and, upon the approach of Octavius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrew himself at his feet and begged that he would pardon him without asking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the reasons for his flight. Octavius conceded his safety on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pledges made, but had him secretly watched. He dismissed the captains of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this triremes and allowed them to go wherever they pleased. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the fleet was ready Octavius set sail again. He landed at Vibo and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered Messala, who had two legions of infantry, to cross over to Sicily,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin the army of Lepidus, pass through to the bay in front of Tauromenium,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand station himself there. He sent three legions to Stylis and the extremity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the straits, to await events. He ordered Taurus to sail around from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTarentum to Mount Scylacium, which is opposite Tauromenium. Taurus did so, having prepared\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself for fighting as well as for rowing. His infantry kept even pace with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, the cavalry reconnoitring by land and the liburnicas by sea. While he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas making this movement Octavius, who had advanced from Vibo, made his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearance near Scylacium, and, after giving his approval to the good order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forces, returned to Vibo. Pompeius, as I have already said, guarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall the landing-places on the island and retained his fleet at Messana, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to send aid where it might be needed. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Such were the preparations of Octavius and Pompeius in this quarter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile four more legions were en route to Lepidus from Africa in merchant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships, being the remainder of his army. Papias, one of Pompeius' captains,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrew himself in their way on the sea, and, after they had received him as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriend (for they thought that these were ships sent by Lepidus to meet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem), destroyed them. Some ships were despatched by Lepidus later, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese were approaching, the merchant ships that had escaped mistook them for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother enemies and fled. So some of them were burned, some captured, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupset, and the rest returned to Africa. Two legions perished in the sea, or,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif any of them could swim, Tisienus, the lieutenant of Pompeius, slew them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they reached the land. The other legions re\u00ebmbarked and joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, some sooner and some later. Papias sailed back to Pompeius. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius crossed from Vibo with his whole fleet to Strongyle, one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the five \u00c6olian islands, having made a reconnoissance of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea beforehand. Seeing large forces in front of him on the Sicilian shore at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPelorum, Myl\u00e6, and Tyndaris, he conjectured that Pompeius himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas there. So he left Agrippa in command and returned again to Vibo, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthence hastened with Messala and three legions to the camp of Taurus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintending to seize Tauromenium while Pompeius was still absent, and thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreaten him on two sides at once. In pursuance of this plan Agrippa moved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward from Strongyle to the island of Hiera, and as Pompeius' garrison\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade no resistance he occupied it and intended on the following day to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack, at Myl\u00e6, Demochares, the lieutenant of Pompeius, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforty ships. Pompeius observed the menacing attitude of Agrippa, and sent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemochares from Messana forty-five ships, under the command of his freedman\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollophanes, and followed in person with seventy others. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Agrippa, with half of his ships, sailed out of Hiera before daylight in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have a naval engagement with Papias only. When he saw the fleet of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollophanes also, and seventy ships on the other wing, he sent word to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius at once that Pompeius was at Myl\u00e6 with the greater part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his naval forces. Then he placed himself with his heavy ships in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentre, and summoned the remainder of his fleet from Hiera in all haste. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations on both sides were superb. The ships had towers on both stem\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand stern. When the usual exhortation had been given and the standards\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised, they rushed against each other, some coming bow on, others making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflank attacks, the shouts of the men and the spray from the ships adding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterror to the scene. The Pompeian ships were shorter and lighter, and better\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadapted to blockading and darting about. Those of Octavius were larger and\n\t\t\t\t\t\theavier, and, consequently, slower, yet stronger to give blows and not so\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasily damaged. The Pompeian crews were better sailors than those of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, but the latter were stronger. Accordingly, the former excelled not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso much in close fighting as in the nimbleness of their movements, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreaking oar blades and rudders, cutting off oar handles, or separating the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's ships entirely, doing them no less harm than by ramming. Those of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius sought to cut down with their beaks the hostile ships, which were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller in size, or shatter them, or break through them. When they came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclose quarters, being higher, they could hurl missiles down upon the enemy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more easily throw the corvus and the grappling-irons. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeians, whenever they were overpowered in this manner, leaped into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea and were picked up by their small boats, which were hovering around for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Agrippa bore down directly upon Papias and struck his ship under the bow,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshattering it and breaking a hole in the keel. The men in the towers were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshaken down, the water rushed into the ship, and all the oarsmen on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower benches were cut off. The others broke through the deck and escaped by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswimming. Papias escaped to a ship alongside of his own, and returned to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle. Pompeius, who observed from a mountain that his ships were making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle headway, and that whenever they came to close quarters with the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were denuded of fighting men, and that reinforcements were coming to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgrippa from Hiera, gave the signal to retire in good order. This they did,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvancing and retreating little by little. Agrippa continued to bear down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon them, and they took refuge, not on the beach, but among the shoals\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed in the sea by river deposits. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Agrippa's pilots prevented him from running his large ships on the shoals. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcast anchor in the open sea, intending to blockade the enemy and to fight a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle by night if necessary; but his friends advised him not to be carried\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway by rashness and not to wear out his soldiers with excessive toil and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant of sleep, and not to trust to that tempestuous sea. So in the evening\n\t\t\t\t\t\the reluctantly withdrew. The Pompeians made sail to their harbors, having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost thirty of their ships, and sunk five of the enemy's, and having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflicted considerable other damage and suffered as much in return. Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraised his own men because they had resisted such formidable vessels,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying they had fought against walls rather than against ships; and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewarded them as though they had been victorious. He encouraged them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieve that, as they were lighter, they would prevail over the enemy in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraits on account of the current. He said also that he would make some\n\t\t\t\t\t\taddition to the height of his ships. Such was the result of the naval battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Myl\u00e6 between Agrippa and Papias. \n\t\t\t\t"},"11":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius suspected that Octavius had gone to the camp of Taurus for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of attacking Tauromenium, which was the fact. So, directly after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupper, he sailed to Messana, leaving a part of his forces at Myl\u00e6\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that Agrippa might think that he was still there. Agrippa, as soon as his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy was sufficiently rested, bestirred himself and set sail for Tyndaris,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had offered to surrender. He entered the town, but the garrison fought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaliantly and drove him out. Some other towns espoused his cause and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived his garrisons, and he returned that evening. In the meantime,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius had sailed from Scylacium to Leucopetra, \n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving learned for a certainty that Pompeius had gone from Messana to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyl\u00e6 on account of Agrippa. He was about to cross the straits from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLeucopetra to Tauromenium by night, but learning of the sea-fight he changed\n\t\t\t\t\t\this mind, thinking that a victor ought not to steal his passage, but to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcross with his army boldly by daylight; for he was fully convinced that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius was still confronting Agrippa. Looking down from the mountains upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea at daybreak and finding that it was clear of enemies, he set sail\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith as many troops as the ships could carry, leaving the rest with Messala\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil the fleet could return to him. Arriving at Tauromenium, he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessengers to demand its surrender. As his guards were not admitted, he made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsail to the river Onobalas and the temple of Venus, and moored his fleet at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe shrine of the Archegetes, the god of the Naxians, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tintending to pitch his camp there and attack Tauromenium. The Archegetes is\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta small statue of Apollo, erected by the Naxians when they first migrated to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Octavius disembarked from his ship he slipped and fell, but arose\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout assistance. While he was yet laying out his camp, Pompeius made his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearance with a large fleet--an astounding spectacle, since Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that he had been beaten by Agrippa. Pompeius' cavalry advanced at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same time, rivalling the fleet in rapidity of movement, and his infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas seen on the other side. The forces of Octavius were terrified at finding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves surrounded by enemies on three sides, and Octavius himself was\n\t\t\t\t\t\talarmed because Messala could not join him. The cavalry of Pompeius assailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' men while they were still fortifying their camp. If his infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand his naval force had attacked simultaneously with the cavalry, Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have accomplished greater results, but, being inexperienced in war and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tignorant of the panic among the troops of Octavius, and hesitating to begin\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta battle at the approach of nightfall, one part of his forces stationed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves at the promontory of Coccynus, while his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfantry, deeming it unwise to encamp near the enemy, withdrew to the town\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Ph\u0153nix. Night coming on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey went to rest, and Octavius' soldiers finished their camp, but were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincapacitated for battle by toil and want of sleep. They consisted of three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, and 500 cavalry without horses, 1000 light-armed, and 2000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonists serving as allies, but not enrolled, besides his fleet. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius placed all of his infantry under charge of Cornificius, and ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to drive back the enemy and do whatever the exigencye required. He took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tship before daylight and went seaward lest the enemy should enclose him on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis side also, giving the right wing of the fleet to Titinius and the left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Carcius, and embarking himself on a liburnica, with which he sailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the whole fleet, exhorting them to have courage. Having done this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowered the general's ensign, as is customary in times of extreme danger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius put to sea against him, and they encountered each other twice, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle ending with the night. Some of Octavius' ships were captured and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned; others spread their small sails and made for the Italian coast,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to orders. Those of Pompeius followed them a short distance and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen turned against the remainder, capturing some and burning others. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the crews swam ashore, most of whom were slaughtered or taken prisoners\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Pompeius' cavalry. Some of them set out to reach the camp of Cornificius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho sent only his light-armed troops to assist them as they came near,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he did not consider it prudent to move his disheartened legionaries\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the enemy's infantry, who were naturally much encouraged by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius spent the greater part of the night among his small boats, in doubt\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether he should go back to Cornificius through the scattered remains of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this fleet, or take refuge with Messala. Providence brought him to the harbor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Abala with a single armor-bearer, without friends, attendants, or slaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCertain persons, who had come down from the mountain to learn the news,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound him suffering in body and mind and brought him in rowboats (changing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom one to another for the purpose of concealment) to the camp of Messala,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was not far distant. Straightway, and before he had attended to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodily wants, he despatched a liburnica to Cornificius, and sent word\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthroughout the mountains that he was safe, and ordered all his forces to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelp Cornificius, and wrote to him that he would send him aid forthwith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter attending to his own person and taking a little rest, he set forth by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight, accompanied by Messala, to Stylis, where Carinas was stationed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree legions ready to embark, and ordered him to set sail for Lipara, to which place he would shortly follow. He wrote to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgrippa and urged him to send Laronius with an army to the rescue of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCornificius with all speed. He sent M\u00e6cenas again to Rome on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the revolutionists; and some of these, who were stirring up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisorder, were punished. He also sent Messala to Puteoli to bring the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso-called first legion to Vibo. \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This was the same Messala whom the triumvirs proscribed at Rome, and for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkilling of whom money and freedom were offered as rewards. He had fled to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius and Brutus, and after their death had delivered his fleet to Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin pursuance of an agreement made between them. It seems fitting to recall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis fact in honor of Roman magnanimity, inasmuch as Messala, when he had in\n\t\t\t\t\t\this power, overwhelmed with misfortune, the man who had proscribed him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaved him and cared for him as his commander. Cornificius was able easily to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefend his camp against attack; but, being in danger from want of supplies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the drew his men out for battle and challenged the enemy. But Pompeius did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot care to come to an engagement with men whose only hope rested in battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand whom he expected to subdue by famine. Cornificius, having placed in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentre the unarmed men who had escaped to him from the ships, took to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad, grievously exposed to missiles in the open plains from the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\t\thorsemen and in the broken country from the light-armed troops from Numidia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Africa, who hurled darts from long distances and made their escape when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged by their enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t On the fourth day, with difficulty, they arrived at the waterless region\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich they say was formerly inundated by a stream of fire that ran down as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar as the sea and dried up all the streams in the district. The inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the country traverse it only by night, on account of the stifling heat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the dust and ashes with which it abounds. Being ignorant of the roads\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand fearing ambush, Cornificius and his men did not dare to march through it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby night, especially as there was no moon, nor could they endure the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaytime, because of suffocation. Moreover, the bottoms of their feet were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned (especially those who had no shoes), as it was now the hottest part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the summer. On account of the tormenting thirst they could not delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey could no longer charge upon their assailants, but received wounds\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any means of defence. When they saw the place of exit from this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned district occupied by enemies, the able-bodied ones, heedless of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsick and barefooted companions, dashed at the defiles with amazing courage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overpowered the enemy with all their remaining strength. When they found\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next defiles occupied by hostile forces they gave way to despair and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccumbed to thirst and heat. Cornificius aroused them by showing them a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspring of water near by; and again they overpowered the enemy, but with\n\t\t\t\t\t\theavy loss to themselves. Another body of enemies held possession of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfountain, and now Cornificius' men lost all courage and gave way completely. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t While they were in this state Laronius, who had been sent by Agrippa with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree legions, made his appearance a long way off. Although it was not yet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplain that he was a friend, still, as they had been all the time hoping for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething of this kind, they once more recovered their spirits. When they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw the enemy abandon the water in order not to be exposed to attack on both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsides, they shouted for joy with all their strength. When the troops of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLaronius shouted in return, they ran and seized the fountain. The leaders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbade the men to drink to excess. Some who neglected this advice died\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile drinking. In this unexpected manner did Cornificius, and what was left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his army, escape to Agrippa at Myl\u00e6. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Agrippa had just taken Tyndaris, a stronghold full of provisions and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmirably situated for naval warfare. Thither Octavius transported his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfantry and cavalry. He had in Sicily all together twenty-one legions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe former, 20,000 of the latter, and more than 5000 light-armed troops. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarrison of Pompeius still held Myl\u00e6, and all the places from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyl\u00e6 to Naulochi and Pelorus, and all the coast. These garrisons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin fear of Agrippa, kept fires burning continually, signifying that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould set fire to any ships that should sail against them. Pompeius was also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster of the defiles on both sides of the island. The mountain passes in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe neighborhood of Tauromenium and around Myl\u00e6 were fortified by\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and he harassed Octavius when the latter was making a forward movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Tyndaris, but not coming to an engagement. Believing that Agrippa was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoving his fleet against him, Pompeius changed his position to Pelorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoning the defiles around Myl\u00e6; and Octavius occupied them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso Myl\u00e6 and Artemisium, a very small town, in which, they say,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the cattle of the Sun and where Ulysses fell asleep. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the report of Agrippa's movement turned out to be false, Pompeius was\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroubled that he had lost the defiles, and he called to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance Tisienus with his army. Octavius sought to intercept Tisienus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut lost his way around Mount Myconium. He passed the night there without\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttents. There was a heavy rainfall, as often occurs in the autumn, and some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his armor-bearers held a Gallic shield over his head the whole night.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHarsh mutterings and prolonged roars from Mount Etna were heard, accompanied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby flames which lighted up the camp, so that the Germans sprang from their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeds in fear. Others, who had heard what had been related of Mount Etna,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not have been surprised, in presence of these remarkable phenomena, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta torrent of fire had rolled upon them. After this Octavius ravaged the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterritory of the Abac\u00e6nians, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, who was foraging, met him, and they both encamped near Messana. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As there had been many skirmishes throughout Sicily, but no general\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement, Octavius sent Taurus to cut off Pompeius' supplies by first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapturing the towns that furnished them. Pompeius was so much inconvenienced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby this that he decided to stake everything on a great battle. Since he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared the enemy's infantry, but had confidence in his own ships, he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand asked Octavius if he would allow the war to be decided by a naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement. Octavius, although he dreaded all naval encounters, which until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow had turned out badly for him, considered it base to refuse, and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordingly, accepted the challenge. A day was fixed by them, for which 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships were put in readiness on either side, provided with missiles of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinds, with towers and whatever machines they could think of. Agrippa\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevised one called the harpago, a piece of wood five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcubits long bound with iron and having rings at the extremities. To one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese rings was attached the harpago, an iron claw, to the other numerous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tropes, which drew the harpago by machine power after it had been thrown by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcatapult and had seized the enemy's ships. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the appointed day came the rival shouts of the oarsmen were first heard,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by missiles thrown by machines and by hand, such as stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirebrands, and arrows. Then the ships dashed against each other, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstriking amidships, others on the prows, others on the beaks, where the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblows are most effectual in discomposing the crew and rendering the vessel\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseless. Others broke the opposing line by sailing through it, at the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime discharging arrows and javelins; and the small boats picked up those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho fell overboard. There was a struggle of soldiers while the sailors put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforth their strength and the pilots their skill and their lung-power. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals cheered their men, and all the machines were brought into\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequisition. The harpago achieved the greatest success. Thrown from a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance upon the ships, as it could be by reason of its lightness, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclutched them, especially when the ropes pulled on it from behind. On\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the iron bands it could not be easily cut by the men whom it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked, and those who tried to cut the ropes were prevented from reaching\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem by its length. As this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles. One thing seemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvisable in this unexpected emergency, and that was, to back water and draw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ship away; but as the enemy did the same the force exerted by the men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas equal on both sides, and the harpago did its work. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, when the ships were drawn together, there was every kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfighting, the men leaping upon each other's decks. It was no longer easy to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinguish an enemy from a friend, as they used the same weapons for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost part, and nearly all spoke the Latin tongue, and the watchwords of each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside were divulged to the other while they were mingled together. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarose many and divers frauds and lack of confidence on both sides on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of those using the same watchword. They failed to recognize each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely, and meanwhile the fighting and the sea were a confused medley of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorpses, clashing arms, and crashing ships. They left nothing untried except\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfire. This they abstained from, after their first onset, because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocked together. The foot-soldiers of each army on the land beheld this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea-fight with apprehension and eagerness, believing that their own hope of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety was bound up in it. They could not distinguish anything, however\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply they might look, but merely a long-drawn-out line of 600 ships, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan alternation of cries and groans now on one side and now on the other. \n\t\t\t\t\t","12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Judging from the colors of the towers, which constituted the only difference\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, Agrippa with difficulty made out that Pompeius' ships had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained the greater loss, and he cheered on those who were close to him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough they were already victors. Then he drove at the enemy and pressed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon them without ceasing, until he overpowered those nearest him. They then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowered their towers and turned their ships in flight toward the straits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeventeen of them, which were in advance, made their escape thither. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest were cut off by Agrippa and some were pursued and driven aground. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuers ran aground with them in the rush, and either pulled off those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad come to a standstill or set fire to them. When the Pompeian ships that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still fighting saw what had befallen these, they surrendered to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Then the soldiers of Octavius who were in the ships raised a shout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof victory and those on the land gave an answering shout. Those of Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroaned. Pompeius himself, darting away from Naulochi, hastened to Messana,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving no orders to his infantry in his panic. Accordingly Octavius received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe surrender of Tisienus on terms agreed upon, and of the cavalry besides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were surrendered by their officers. Three of Octavius' ships were sunk\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the fight. Pompeius lost twenty-eight in this way, and the remainder were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned, or captured, or run aground, and stove in pieces, except the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseventeen that escaped. \n\t\t\t\t\t","13":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius learned of the defection of his infantry while on the road, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged his costume from that of a commander to that of a private citizen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sent orders to Messana to put on shipboard everything possible. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations to this end had been made long before. He summoned Plennius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Lilyb\u00e6um in haste, with the eight legions he had, intending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take flight with them. Plennius hastened to comply with this order, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas other friends, garrisons, and soldiers were deserting, and the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet was moving into the straits, Pompeius did not wait for Plennius in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-fortified city, but fled, with his seventeen ships, from Messana to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, whose mother he had saved in similar circumstances. After his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparture Plennius arrived at Messana and occupied the place. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself remained in the camp at Naulochi, but he ordered Agrippa to lay\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsiege to Messana, which the latter did, in conjunction with Lepidus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlennius sent envoys to treat for peace. Agrippa wanted to wait till morning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the arrival of Octavius, but Lepidus granted terms, and, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconciliate the soldiers of Plennius to himself, allowed them to join the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of the army in plundering the city. They had asked for nothing but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety, and now, finding unexpected gain in addition, they plundered Messana\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole night, in conjunction with the soldiers of Lepidus, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tranged themselves under his standards. \n\t\t\t\t"},"12":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Including this new accession, Lepidus now had twenty-two legions of infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a large body of cavalry. He was elated, and thought to make himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster of Sicily, using the pretext that he was the first to invade the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisland and that he had induced many cities to join the triumvirs. He sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tword to the garrisons of these places that they should not admit the\n\t\t\t\t\t\temissaries of Octavius, and he seized all the defiles. Octavius arrived on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe following day, and reproached Lepidus through friends, who reminded him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he had come into Sicily as an ally of Octavius, not to acquire it for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself. Lepidus replied that he had been despoiled of his former allotment,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was now in the exclusive possession of Octavius, and that, if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter pleased, he would now exchange Africa and Sicily for that former\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallotment. Octavius was exasperated. He came to Lepidus in anger and heaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\treproaches on him for ingratitude. They separated, indulging in mutual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreats. They forthwith surrounded themselves with guards, and the ships of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius were anchored away from the shore, as it was said that Lepidus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintended to set fire to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers were angry at the thought of engaging in another civil war, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was never to be an end of sedition. They did not, however, seek\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto compare Octavius and Lepidus; not even the army of Lepidus did that. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmired the energy of Octavius, and.they were aware of the indolence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus. They also blamed him for admitting the defeated enemy to an equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of the plunder. When Octavius learned their state of mind, he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\temissaries among them to advise them secretly of their individual interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMany of them he tampered with, especially those who had served under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, who feared lest the terms of their capitulation should not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalid if Octavius did not ratify them. While Lepidus, by reason of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tineptitude, remained ignorant of these things Octavius came to his camp with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta large body of horse, whom he left at the entrance, and himself went in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a few. Coming forward, he declared to those whom he met that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrawn into war unwillingly. Those who saw him saluted him as imperator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all the Pompeians, who had been tampered with, collected together\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand asked his forgiveness. He said that he was astonished that persons\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasking forgiveness should not do what their own interests demanded. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstood his meaning, and forthwith seized their standards and went over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him, while others began to take down their tents. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When Lepidus became aware of this tumult he sprang from his tent to arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlows were exchanged and one of Octavius' armor-bearers was killed. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself was struck by a weapon on his breastplate, but it did not penetrate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flesh, and he ran and took refuge with his horsemen. A detachment of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguards belonging to Lepidus jeered at him as he ran. Octavius was so angry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he could not restrain himself from dashing upon them with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorsemen and destroying them. The officers of the other guards\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferred their allegiance from Lepidus to Octavius, some immediately,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers during the night; some without solicitation, others pretending to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoerced more or less by the cavalry. There were some who still resisted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassault and beat off the assailants, for Lepidus sent reenforcements in all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections; but when these very re\u00ebnforcements went over, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of his army, even those who were yet well disposed toward him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged their opinion. Again the first to move were those Pompeians who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill remained with him. They transferred themselves by detachments, one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter another. Lepidus armed others to prevent them from going, but the very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones who were armed for this purpose seized their standards and went over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius with the rest. Lepidus threatened and besought them as they took\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir departure. He held fast to the standards, and said he would not give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem up, until one of the standard-bearers said to him, \"Let go, or you are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta dead man.\" Then he was afraid and let go. \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The last to come over were the cavalry. They sent a messenger to Octavius to\n\t\t\t\t\t\task if they should kill Lepidus, who was no longer a commander. He replied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the negative. Thus was Lepidus deserted by all and bereft, in a moment of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, of so exalted a station and so great an army. He changed his costume\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand hastened to Octavius, all the spectators running with him to enjoy the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspectacle. Octavius started up as he approached, and prevented him from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrowing himself at his feet, and sent him to Rome in the garb of a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen, which he was wearing, deprived of his command, but not of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpriesthood, which he held. And so this man, who had often been a commander\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand once a triumvir, who had appointed magistrates and had proscribed so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany men of his own rank, passed his life as a private citizen, asking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavors of some of the proscribed, who were magistrates at a later\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Octavius neither pursued Pompeius nor allowed others to do so; either because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the refrained from encroaching on Antony's dominions, or because he preferred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto wait and see what Antony would do to Pompeius and make that a pretext for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta quarrel if he should do wrong (for they had long entertained the suspicion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat ambition would bring them into mutual conflict when other rivals were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of the way), or, as Octavius said later, because Pompeius was not one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this father's murderers. He now brought his forces together, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamounted to forty-five legions of infantry, 25,000 horse, and some 40,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlight-armed troops. He also had 600 war-ships and an immense number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerchant vessels, which he sent back to their owners. To the soldiers he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tawarded the prizes of victory, paying a part down and promising the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater. He distributed crowns and other honors to all, and granted pardon to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pompeian leaders. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Fortune became jealous of his great prosperity. His army revolted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially his own troops. They demanded to be discharged from the service\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that rewards should be given them equal to those given to the men who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought at Philippi. Octavius knew that the present war had not been of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame grade as that one. He promised nevertheless to pay what their services\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere worth, and to include the soldiers serving under Antony when the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould return. As to their breach of discipline, he reminded them, in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatening tone, of the laws of their ancestors, of their oaths and of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishments. As they gave little heed to what he said, he abandoned his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatening tone lest the spirit of mutiny should extend to his newly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquired troops, and said that he would discharge them at the proper time in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconjunction with Antony. He said, also, that he would not engage them in any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore civil wars, which had fortunately come to an end, but in war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Illyrians and other barbarous tribes, who were disturbing the peace\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been gained with so much difficulty; from which war the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould acquire great riches. They said that they would not go to war again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil they had received the prizes and honors of the previous wars. He said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would not postpone the honors. So he distributed many prizes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave to the legions additional crowns, and to the centurions and tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurple-bordered garments and the dignity of chief councillors in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnative towns. While he was distributing other awards of this kind, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribune Ofilius exclaimed that crowns and purple garments were playthings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor boys, that the rewards for soldiers were lands and money. The multitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcried out, \"Well said\"; whereupon Octavius descended from the platform in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanger. The soldiers gathered around the tribune, praising him and railing at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who did not join with them. Ofilius said that he alone would suffice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto defend so just a cause, but after saying this he disappeared the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing day, and it was never known what became of him. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers no longer dared to give utterance to their complaints singly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut they joined together in groups and called for their discharge in common.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius conciliated their leaders in various ways. He released those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad served at Philippi and Mutina, and who wished to be discharged, as their\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime had expired. These, to the number of 20,000, he dismissed and sent out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the island at once, lest they should seduce the others. To those only \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t AUGUSTUS \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the Braccio Nuovo, Vatican Museum, Rome \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t who had served at Mutina he added, that, although they were discharged in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis way, he would fulfil the promises made to them at that time. He came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the rest of the army and called upon them to bear witness to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperjury of the revolters, who had been dismissed contrary to the wish of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir military commander. He praised those who remained with him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged them to expect a speedy release, saying that nobody would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsorry, and that they would be discharged rich, and that he would give them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t500 drachmas per man now. Having thus spoken, he exacted tribute from Sicily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the amount of 1600 talents, appointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropr\u00e6tors for Africa and Sicily, and assigned a division of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy to each of these provinces. He sent back Antony's ships to Tarentum. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of the army he sent in advance of himself to Italy in ships, and took\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe remainder with him when he departed from the island. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When he arrived at Rome the Senate voted him unbounded honors, giving him the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivilege of accepting all, or such as he chose. They and the people went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout a long distance to meet him, wearing garlands on their heads, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tescorted him, when he arrived, first to the temples, and then from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemples to his house. The next day he made speeches to the Senate and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, recounting his exploits and his policy from the beginning to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent time. These speeches he wrote down and distributed in pamphlet form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe proclaimed peace and good-will, said that the civil wars were ended,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremitted the unpaid taxes, and released the farmers of the revenue and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholders of public leases from what they owed. Of the honors voted to him, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccepted an ovation and annual solemnities on the days of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictories, and a golden image to be erected in the forum, with the garb he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twore when he entered the city, to stand on a column surrounded by the beaks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof captured ships. There the image was placed bearing the inscription:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \"PEACE, LONG DISTURBED, HE RE\u00cbSTABLISHED ON LAND AND\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSEA.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the people desired to transfer from Lepidus to himself the office of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpontifex maximus, which the law bestowed upon one person for life, he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot accept it, and when they prayed that Lepidus might be put to death as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic enemy he would not allow it. He sent sealed letters to all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies, with instructions to open them all on a designated day and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecute the orders contained therein. These orders related to the slaves who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad run away during the civil dissensions and joined the armies, for whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius had asked freedom, which the Senate and the treaty had granted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese were all arrested on the same day and brought to Rome, and Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned them to their Roman or Italian masters, or to the heirs of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame. He also gave back those belonging to Sicilian masters. Those whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobody claimed he caused to be put to death in the cities from which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad absconded. \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This seemed to be the end of the civil dissensions. Octavius was now\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwenty-eight years of age. Cities joined in placing him among their tutelary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgods. At this time Italy and Rome itself were openly infested with bands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trobbers, whose doings were more like barefaced plunder than secret theft.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSabinus was chosen by Octavius to correct this disorder. He executed many of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe captured brigands, and within one year brought about a condition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsolute security. At that time, they say, originated the custom and system\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof cohorts of night watchmen still in force. Octavius excited astonishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby having put an end to this evil with such unexampled rapidity. He allowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe yearly magistrates to administer public affairs, in many particulars,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the customs of the fathers. He burned the writings which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontained evidence concerning the civil strife, and said that he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabdicate entirely when Antony should return from the Parthian war, for he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas persuaded that Antony, too, would be willing to lay down the government,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe civil wars being at an end. Thereupon he was chosen tribune for life by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacclamation, the people urging him, by the offer of this perpetual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistracy, to give up his former one. This he accepted, and at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same time he wrote privately to Antony in reference to their government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony gave instructions to Bibulus, who was going away from him, to confer\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Octavius. He sent governors to take charge of his provinces in like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner as Octavius had done, and he had thoughts of joining the latter in\n\t\t\t\t\t\this expedition against the Illyrians. \n\t\t\t\t"},"13":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius, fleeing from Sicily to Antony, stopped at the Lacinian promontory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand robbed the rich temple of Juno of its gifts. He landed at Mitylene and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspent some time at that place, where his father, when at war with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC\u00e6sar, had bestowed him with his mother, when he was still a boy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand where his father had recovered him after his defeat. As Antony was now\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaging war in Media against the Medes and the Parthians, Pompeius decided to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrust himself to Antony on his return. When he heard that Antony had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworsted, and this result was confirmed by the reports, his hopes once more\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevived, and he fancied that he might succeed Antony if the latter were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, or share his power if he returned. He was continually thinking of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabienus, who had overrun Asia not long before. While he was in this frame\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof mind the news reached him that Antony had returned to Alexandria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScheming with both projects, he sent ambassadors to Antony ostensibly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace himself at the latter's disposal and to offer himself as a friend and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tally, but really to get accurate information about Antony's affairs. At the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame time he sent others secretly to the princes of Thrace and Pontus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintending, if he should not obtain what he desired from Antony, to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight through Pontus to Armenia. He sent also to the Parthians, hoping\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, for the remainder of their war against Antony, they would be eager to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceive him as a general, because he was a Roman, and especially because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the son of Pompey the Great. He refitted his ships and drilled the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers he had brought in them, pretending at one time that he was in fear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius, and at another that he was getting ready to assist Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as Antony heard of the coming of Pompeius he designated Titius to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the field against him. He ordered the latter to take ships and soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria and to wage war vigorously against Pompeius if he showed himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostile, but to treat him with honor if he submitted himself to Antony. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the gave audience to the ambassadors who had arrived, and who addressed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas follows: \"Pompeius has sent us to you, not because he was without a place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof refuge (if he were minded to continue the war) in Spain, a country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendly to him on his father's account and which espoused his own cause\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he was younger, and even now calls upon him for that purpose, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he prefers to enjoy peace with you, or, if need be, to fight under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour orders. He makes these advances now not for the first time, but did so\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was master of Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and when he rescued\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour mother and sent her to you. If you had accepted these advances,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius would not have been driven out of Sicily (for you would not have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided Octavius with ships against him), nor would you have been defeated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Parthia, in consequence of Octavius, not sending you the soldiers he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreed to send. In fact, you would now be in possession of Italy in addition\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto your other dominions. As you did not accept the offer at the time when it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have been most advantageous to you, he repeats it now in order that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may not be so often ensnared by Octavius' words and by the marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship existing between you; for you will remember that, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis connected by marriage with Pompeius, he declared war against the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the treaty had been made, and without excuse. He also deprived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, his partner in the government, of his share, and divided no part of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit with you. \n\t\t\t\t\t","2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \"You are now the only remaining one who stands between him and the monarchy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he longs for. He would already have been at blows with you, had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius stood in the way. Although you ought to have foreseen these things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor yourself, Pompeius calls your attention to them out of good-will,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he prefers a candid and magnanimous man to a deceitful, treacherous,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand artful one. He does not blame you for the gift of ships which you made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Octavius against him as a matter of necessity, in order to procure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers for the Parthian war in exchange, but he reminds you that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers were not sent. In short, Pompeius delivers himself to you with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships which he still has and his most faithful soldiers, who have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoned him even in his flight. If peace is maintained, it will be a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglory to you to have saved the son of Pompey the Great. In case of war, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be a considerable help to your party in the conflict which is coming,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunless, to be sure, it has already come.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t When the ambassadors had thus spoken, Antony showed them the orders he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent to Titius, and said that if Pompeius was truly in this frame of mind he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould come in person under the escort of Titius. In the meantime, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessengers who had been sent by Pompeius to the Parthians were captured by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's generals and brought to Alexandria. After Antony had examined each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them he summoned the ambassadors of Pompeius and showed the captives to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. They made excuses for Pompeius even then as a young man in a desperate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplight, fearful lest Antony should not treat him kindly, and driven by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity to make trial even of the bitterest enemies of Rome. They said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he would show his true disposition as soon as he should learn Antony's,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand would then need no other attempt or devices. Antony believed them, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin other respects and at all times of a frank, magnanimous, and unsuspecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnature. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime Furnius, who was governing the province of Asia for Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad received Pompeius when he arrived, as he was behaving quietly; since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFurnius had not sufficient force to prevent him and did not yet know\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's mind. Seeing Pompeius drilling his troops, he mustered\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta force from the provincials and hastily summoned Ahenobarbus, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand of an army in the vicinity, and also Amyntas from the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey responded promptly, and Pompeius complained against Furnius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregarding him in the light of an enemy when he had sent ambassadors to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and was waiting for an answer from him. While he was saying this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas meditating the project of seizing Ahenobarbus, with the connivance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurius, one of Ahenobarbus' officers, intending to hold that general as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluable hostage to exchange for himself in case of need. The treachery was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered and Curius was convicted before the Romans present and put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Pompeius put to death his freedman Theodorus, the only person who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivy to the plan, believing that he had divulged it. As he no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to conceal his projects from Furnius, he possessed himself of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLampsacus by treachery, a city which contained many Italians, colonized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere by Gaius C\u00e6sar. These Italians he induced to enter his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary service by large bounties. Having now 200 horse and three legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof infantry, he attacked Cyzicus by land and sea. He was repulsed on both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsides, because there was a force, although not a large one, in Cyzicus, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas guarding some gladiators whom Antony supported there. So Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretired to the harbor of the Ach\u00e6ans and collected provisions. \n\t\t\t\t\t","5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Furnius did not begin hostilities, but he continually camped alongside of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius with a large body of horse and prevented his foe from foraging or\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinning the cities to his side. As Pompeius had no cavalry, he assaulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp of Furnius in front and, at the same time, sent a force secretly around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his rear. Furnius accordingly directed his forces against Pompeius' front\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack, but he was driven out of his camp by the force in his rear. Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued his men and killed many as they fled over the Scamandrian plain,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was saturated with recent rains. Those who were saved withdrew to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace of safety, as they were not fit for battle. While they were waiting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor assistance from Mysia, the Propontis, and elsewhere, the inhabitants,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were distressed by continual exactions, enlisted gladly under Pompeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially on account of the reputation he had gained by his victory at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharbor of the Ach\u00e6ans. While Pompeius was deficient in cavalry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was thus crippled in procuring supplies, he learned that a troop of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian horse was coming to Antony, sent by Octavia, who was passing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter in Athens. So he sent emissaries with gold to corrupt this troop, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's governor of Macedonia caught these men and distributed their gold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the cavalry. \n\t\t\t\t\t","6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius took Nic\u00e6a and Nicomedia, from which he obtained large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies of money, and his strength was augmented in all respects with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidity that exceeded his expectations. But Furnius, who was camping not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar away from him, was re\u00ebnforced, at the beginning of spring,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst with seventy ships that had come from Sicily, which had been saved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom those that Antony had lent to Octavius against Pompeius; for after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclose of the war in Sicily Octavius had dismissed them. Then Titius arrived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria with 120 additional ships and a large army; and all these had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlanded at Proconnesus. Pompeius became alarmed and burned his own ships and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmed his oarsmen, believing that he could fight to better advantage with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of his forces combined on land. Cassius of Parma, Nasidius, Saturninus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThermus, Antistius, and the other distinguished men of his party who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill with him as friends, and Fannius, who held the highest rank of all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pompeius' father-in-law, Libo, when they saw that he did not desist from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar against superior forces even after Titius, to whom Antony had given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire charge, had arrived, despaired of him, and, having made terms for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, went over to Antony. \n\t\t\t\t\t","7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius, now deserted by his friends, withdrew to the interior of Bithynia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing reported as making his way to Armenia. One night as he marched out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this camp quietly, Furnius and Titius followed him, and Amyntas joined in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuit. After a hot chase they came up with him toward evening, and each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped by himself around a certain hill without ditch or palisade, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas late and they were tired. While they were in this state, Pompeius made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight attack with 300 light troops and killed many who were still asleep or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspringing out of bed. The rest took to disgraceful flight in a state of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnudity. It is evident that if Pompeius had made this night attack with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire army, or if he had followed up energetically the victory he did win,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the would have overcome them completely. But, misled by a god, he gave no\n\t\t\t\t\t\theed to these opportunities, and he gained no other advantage from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffair than to penetrate farther into the interior of the country. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, having formed a junction, followed him and cut off his supplies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil he was in danger from want. Then he sought an interview with Furnius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had been a friend of Pompey the Great, and who was of higher rank and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more trustworthy character than the others. \n\t\t\t\t\t","8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking a position where a river flowed between them, Pompeius said that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad sent ambassadors to Antony, and he added that, being in need of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovisions meanwhile, and nobody supplying him, he had done what he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone. \"If you have fought against me,\" he continued, \"by Antony's direction,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony has misconceived his own interests in not foreseeing the coming war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you are anticipating Antony's intentions, I protest and implore you to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twait for the embassy that I sent to Antony or to take and bring me to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow. I will surrender myself to you alone, Furnius, asking merely your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpledge that you will conduct me to him in safety.\" He spoke thus because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad confidence in Antony as a man of generous nature, and he apprehended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely that something might happen to him on the journey. Furnius replied to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim as follows: \"If you wished to surrender yourself to Antony you ought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave done so in the beginning, or else have waited quietly at Mitylene for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this answer. But if you desired the war you should have done as you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone. Why is it necessary to recount your deeds to one who knows them? If\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow you repent, do not bring us, generals, into collision with each other,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut surrender yourself to Titius, to whom these matters have been intrusted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Antony. The pledge which you ask from me you can ask from him. He has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen ordered by Antony to put you to death if you wage war, but, if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender yourself, to send you to him in an honorable manner.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t","9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Pompeius was angry with Titius as an ingrate, in that he undertook to wage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis war against him, for he had once been taken prisoner and spared by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius. Besides being angry he considered it beneath his dignity to be in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe power of Titius, who was not of noble birth. Moreover he suspected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitius, either because he was acquainted with his character and did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider him trustworthy, or because he was conscious of some old injury\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone to him previous to the benefaction above mentioned. Again he offered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender himself to Furnius, and begged that he would receive him. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter refused he said that he would surrender to Amyntas. Furnius said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmyntas would not receive him, because that would be an insult to the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom Antony had intrusted with this whole business; and so the interview\n\t\t\t\t\t\tended. The opinion prevailed in the camp of Furnius that, for want of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources, Pompeius would deliver himself up to Titius on the following day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen night came Pompeius left the customary fires burning, and the trumpets\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving the usual signal at intervals through the night, while he quietly\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew from the camp with a well-prepared band, who had not been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously advised whither they were to go. He intended to go to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea-shore and burn Titius' fleet, and perhaps would have done so had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScaurus deserted from him and communicated the fact of his departure and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad he had taken, although ignorant of his design. Amyntas, with 1500 horse, pursued Pompeius, who had no cavalry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Amyntas drew near, Pompeius' men passed over to him, some privately,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers openly. Pompeius, being almost entirely deserted and afraid of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town men, surrendered himself to Amyntas without conditions, although he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscorned to surrender to Titius with conditions. \n\t\t\t\t\t","10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus was Sextus Pompeius captured. He was the last remaining son of Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Great, and had been deprived of his father when very young and of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother while still a stripling. After their death he concealed himself for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta long time and practised robbery secretly in Spain until he had collected a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge following, because he made himself known as Pompey's son. Then he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpractised more open robbery. After the death of Gaius C\u00e6sar he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried on war vigorously and collected a large army, together with ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand money, took islands, became master of the western sea, brought famine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon Italy, and compelled his enemies to make peace on such terms as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchose. Of most importance was the aid that he rendered to the proscribed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome exposed to utter destruction, rescuing many of the nobility who were,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat this later time, safe at home by means of him. But stricken with mental\n\t\t\t\t\t\taberration, he never pursued an aggressive policy against his foes, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortune offered him many opportunities; he only defended himself. After such\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta career Pompeius was taken prisoner. \n\t\t\t\t\t","11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Titius brought Pompeius' soldiers into Antony's service and put Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself to death at Miletus in the fortieth year of his age. This he did\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither on his own account, angry at some former insult, and ungrateful for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe subsequent kindness, or in pursuance of Antony's order. Some say that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlancus, not Antony, gave this order. They think that Plancus, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoverning Syria, was authorized by letters to sign Antony's name in cases of\n\t\t\t\t\t\turgency and to use his seal. Others think that it was written by Plancus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Antony's knowledge, but that the latter was ashamed to write it on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the name Pompeius, and because Cleopatra was favorable to him on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of Pompey the Great. Still others think that Plancus, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcognizant of these facts, took it upon himself to give the order as a matter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof precaution, lest Pompeius, with the co\u00f6peration of Cleopatra,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould breed dissension between Antony and Octavius. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t","12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t After the death of Pompeius Antony made a new expedition to Armenia, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius made one against the Illyrians, who were plundering Italy, some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom had never been subject to the Romans, while others had revolted during\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe civil wars. Since these Illyrian affairs are not very well known to me,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand are not of sufficient length to make a book by themselves, and have no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuitable place to be treated elsewhere, I have recorded them above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(beginning with the time when Illyria was acquired by the Romans and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing them down to the end), and added them to the history of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighboring Macedonia. \n\t\t\t\t"}},"5":{"0":{"0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t WHEN Troy was captured on the 8th day of the month of December,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00c6neas fled to Mount Ida, passing through the Ach\u00e6ans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho gave way to him as he was carrying off his household gods and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamily.
