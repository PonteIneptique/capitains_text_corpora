In size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarth. As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast, and from them projected a hundred dragons' heads. From\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers, which when drawn out,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twinged :unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes. Such and so great was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphon when, hurling kindled rocks, he made for the very heaven with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the gods saw him rushing at heaven, they made for Egypt in flight, and being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued they changed their forms into those of animals. However Zeus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstruck him down with an adamantine sickle, and as he fled pursued him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosely as far as Mount Casius, which overhangs Syria . There, seeing the monster sore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twounded, he grappled with him. But Typhon twined about him and gripped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea to Cilicia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave. Likewise he put away the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe-dragon Delphyne, who was a half-bestial maiden. But Hermes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAegipan stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus. And having recovered his strength Zeus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly from heaven, riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphon with thunderbolts and pursued him to the mountain called Nysa , where the Fates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuasion that he would be strengthened thereby. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing again pursued he came to Thrace , and in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved whole mountains. But when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese recoiled on him through the force of the thunderbolt, a stream of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstance the mountain was called Haemus . And when he started to flee through the Sicilian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Sicily upon him. That is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta huge mountain, from which down to this day they say that blasts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfire issue from the thunderbolts that were thrown. So much for that subject. \n "

When the Bebryces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflight with great slaughter. \n ",
                "20":"\n \n Thence they put to sea and came to land at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSalmydessus in Thrace , where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelt Phineus, a seer who had lost the sight of both eyes. Some say he was a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgenor, but others that he was a son of Poseidon,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand he is variously alleged to have been blinded by the gods for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforetelling men the future; or by Boreas and the Argonauts because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblinded his own sons at the instigation of their stepmother; or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould sail from Colchis to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Greece . The gods also\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsent the Harpies to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttable was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmost of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould touch it. When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvoyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Harpies. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfood. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air. Now it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Peloponnese , the river\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t( but Hesiod calls her Ocypode) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfled by the Propontis till she came to the Echinadian Islands, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnow called Strophades after her; for when she came to them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe turned ( estraphe ) and being at the shore fell\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would wrong Phineus no more. \n \n ",
                "21":"\n \n Being rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClashing Rocks in the sea. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere huge cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tloud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelp of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad made the passage, they should come to rest completely. \n ",

There died Idmon the seer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a wound inflicted by a boar; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand there too died Tiphys, and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship. \n And having sailed past the Thermodon and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Caucasus they came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Phasis , which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Colchian land. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeetes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyoke the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls that he had, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenormous size, a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfire from their mouths. These creatures Aeetes ordered him to yoke and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto sow dragon's teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tteeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes . While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean. And fearing lest he might be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece, if he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvoyage to Greece . When Jason\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tswore to do so, she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them. But though the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso, Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fleece and in Jason's company came to the Argo. She was attended,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo, by her brother Apsyrtus. And with them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArgonauts put to sea by night. \n ",
                "23":"\n \n When Aeetes discovered the daring deeds done by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedea, he started off in pursuit of the ship; but when she saw him near,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimbs of his child, he called the place Tomi . But he sent out many of the Colchians\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued the search in divers places. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArgonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus sent a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified. \n \n ",

Now Danaus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistrusted their professions and bore them a grudge on account of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texile; nevertheless he consented to the marriage and allotted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdamsels among them. First, they picked out Hypermnestra as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe eldest to be the wife of Lynceus, and Gorgophone to be the wife of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProteus; for Lynceus and Proteus had been borne to Egyptus by a woman of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\troyal blood, Argyphia; but of the rest Busiris, Enceladus, Lycus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaiphron obtained by lot the daughters that had been borne to Danaus by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Europe , to wit,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAutomate, Amymone, Agave, and Scaea. These daughters were borne to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDanaus by a queen; but Gorgophone and Hypermnestra were borne to him by Elephantis.

Agaptolemus got Pirene; Cercetes got Dorium; Eurydamas got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhartis; Aegius got Mnestra; Argius got Evippe; Archelaus got Anaxibia;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMenemachus got Nelo. These seven sons were begotten on a Phoenician\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twoman, and the maidens on an Ethiopian woman. The sons of Egyptus by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyria got as their wives, without drawing lots, the daughters of Danaus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Memphis in virtue of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilarity of their names; thus Clitus got Clite; Sthenelus got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSthenele; Chrysippus got Chrysippe. The twelve sons of Egyptus by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNaiad nymph Caliadne cast lots for the daughters of Danaus by the Naiad\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnymph Polyxo: the sons were Eurylochus, Phantes, Peristhenes, Hermus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDryas, Potamon, Cisseus, Lixus, Imbrus, Bromius, Polyctor, Chthonius;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the damsels were Autonoe, Theano, Electra, Cleopatra, Eurydice,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGlaucippe, Anthelia, Cleodore, Evippe, Erato, Stygne, Bryce. The sons of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptus by Gorgo, cast lots for the daughters of Danaus by Pieria, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeriphas got Actaea, Oeneus got Podarce, Egyptus got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDioxippe, Menalces got Adite, Lampus got Ocypete, Idmon got Pylarge. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyoungest sons of Egyptus were these: Idas got Hippodice; Daiphron got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdiante ( the mother who bore these damsels was Herse); Pandion got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCallidice; Arbelus got Oeme; Hyperbius got Celaeno; Hippocorystes got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperippe; the mother of these men was Hephaestine, and the mother of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese damsels was Crino. When they had got their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrides by lot, Danaus made a feast and gave his daughters daggers; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey slew their bridegrooms as they slept, all but Hypermnestra; for she\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaved Lynceus because he had respected her virginity: wherefore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDanaus shut her up and kept her under ward. But the rest of the daugters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Danaus buried the heads of their bridegrooms in Lerna \n and paid funeral honors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto their bodies in front of the city; and Athena and Hermes purified\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem at the command of Zeus. Danaus afterwards united Hypermnestra to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLynceus; and bestowed his other daughters on the victors in an athletic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontest. \n Amymone had a son Nauplius by Poseidon. This Nauplius lived to a great age, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsailing the sea he used by beacon lights to lure to death such as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfell in with. It came to pass, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he himself died by that very death. But before his death he married\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta wife; according to the tragic poets, she was Clymene, daughter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCatreus; but according to the author of The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReturns , she was Philyra; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to Cercops she was Hesione.

But of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsons of Electryon there survived Licymnius, who was still young; and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sons of Pterelaus there survived Everes, who guarded the ships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose of the Taphians who escaped sailed away, taking with them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcattle they had lifted, and entrusted them to Polyxenus, king of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEleans; but Amphitryon ransomed them from Polyxenus and brought them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Mycenae . Wishing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavenge his sons' death, Electryon purposed to make war on the Teleboans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut first he committed the kingdom to Amphitryon along with his daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlcmena, binding him by oath to keep her a virgin until his return. However, as he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treceiving the cows back, one of them charged, and Amphitryon threw at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther the club which he had in his hands. But the club rebounded from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcow's horns and striking Electryon's head killed him. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSthenelus laid hold of this pretext to banish Amphitryon from the whole of Argos , while he himself seized the throne of Mycenae and Tiryns ; and he entrusted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Midea to Atreus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThyestes, the sons of Pelops, whom he had sent for. 0 Amphitryon went with Alcmena and Licymnius to Thebes and was purified by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreon and gave his sister Perimede to Licymnius. And as Alcmena said\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe would marry him when he had avenged her brothers' death, Amphitryon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tengaged to do so, and undertook an expedition against the Teleboans, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvited Creon to assist him. Creon said he would join in the expedition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif Amphitryon would first rid the Cadmea of the vixen; for a brute of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvixen was ravaging the Cadmea. But though Amphitryon undertook the task, it was fated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nobody should catch her. \n ",
                "6":"\n As the country suffered thereby, the Thebans every month exposed a son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof one of the citizens to the brute, which would have carried off many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif that were not done. So Amphitryon betook him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCephalus, son of Deioneus, at Athens , and persuaded him, in return for a share of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTeleboan spoils, to bring to the chase the dog which Procris had brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Crete as a gift from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinos ; for that dog was destined to catch whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit pursued. So then, when the vixen was chased by the dog, Zeus turned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth of them into stone. Supported by his allies, to wit, Cephalus from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThoricus in Attica , Panopeus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Phocis , Heleus, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerseus, from Helos in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Argolis , and Creon from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Thebes , Amphitryon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\travaged the islands of the Taphians.

He slew Comaetho, and sailed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe booty to Thebes , and gave the islands to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeleus and Cephalus; and they founded cities named after themselves and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelt in them. \n ",

But when Amphitryon arrived and saw that he was not welcomed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby his wife, he inquired the cause; and when she told him that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcome the night before and slept with her, he learned from Tiresias how\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus had enjoyed her. And Alcmena bore two sons, to wit, Hercules, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe had by Zeus and who was the elder by one night, and Iphicles, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe had by Amphitryon. When the child was eight months old, Hera desired\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlcmena called Amphitryon to her help, but Hercules arose and killed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tserpents by strangling them with both his hands. However, Pherecydes says that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas Amphitryon who put the serpents in the bed, because he would know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich of the two children was his, and that when Iphicles fled, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules stood his ground, he knew that Iphicles was begotten of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody. \n ",
                "8":"\n \n Hercules was taught to drive a chariot by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmphitryon, to wrestle by Autolycus, to shoot with the bow by Eurytus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto fence by Castor, and to play the lyre by Linus. This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Thebes and became a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTheban, but was killed by Hercules with a blow of the lyre; for being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstruck by him, Hercules flew into a rage and slew him. When he was tried for murder, Hercules quoted a law of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhadamanthys, who laid it down that whoever defends himself against a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twrongful aggressor shall go free, and so he was acquitted. But fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the might do the like again, Amphitryon sent him to the cattle farm; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere he was nurtured and outdid all in stature and strength. Even by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe look of him it was plain that he was a son of Zeus; for his body\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasured four cubits, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflashed a gleam of fire from his eyes; and he did not miss, neither with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bow nor with the javelin. While he was with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe herds and had reached his eighteenth year he slew the lion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCithaeron, for that animal, sallying from Cithaeron, harried the kine of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmphitryon and of Thespius. \n \n ",

Now the Thebans paid tribute to Erginus for the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason. Clymenus, king of the Minyans, was wounded with a cast of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone by a charioteer of Menoeceus, named Perieres, in a precinct of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoseidon at Onchestus; and being carried dying to Orchomenus , he with his last breath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged his son Erginus to avenge his death. So Erginus marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Thebes , and after\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughtering not a few of the Thebans he concluded a treaty with them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed by oaths, that they should send him tribute for twenty years,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta hundred kine every year. Falling in with the heralds on their way to Thebes to demand this tribute, Hercules outraged them; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the cut off their ears and noses and hands, and having fastened them by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tropes from their necks, he told them to carry that tribute to Erginus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Minyans. Indignant at this outrage, Erginus marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Thebes . But Hercules,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaving received weapons from Athena and taken the command, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErginus, put the Minyans to flight, and compelled them to pay double the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttribute to the Thebans.

On his way to attack the lion he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcame to Cleonae and lodged at the house of a day-laborer,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMolorchus; and when his host\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould have offered a victim in sacrifice, Hercules told him to wait for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthirty days, and then, if he had returned safe from the hunt, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice to Saviour Zeus, but if he were dead, to sacrifice to him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto a hero. And having come to Nemea and tracked the lion, he first shot an arrow at him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut when he perceived that the beast was invulnerable, he heaved up his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclub and made after him. And when the lion took refuge in a cave with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo mouths, Hercules built up the one entrance and came in upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeast through the other, and putting his arm round its neck held it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttight till he had choked it; so laying it on his shoulders he carried it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Cleonae. And finding Molorchus on the last of the thirty days about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto sacrifice the victim to him as to a dead man, he sacrificed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaviour Zeus and brought the lion to Mycenae . Amazed at his manhood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus forbade him thenceforth to enter the city, but ordered him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texhibit the fruits of his labours before the gates. They say, too, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin his fear he had a bronze jar made for himself to hide in under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearth, and that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsent his commands for the labours through a herald, Copreus, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPelops the Elean.

So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmounting a chariot driven by Iolaus, he came to Lerna , and having halted his horses, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered the hydra on a hill beside the springs of the Amymone, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas its den. By pelting it with fiery shafts he forced it to come out,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand in the act of doing so he seized and held it fast. But the hydra\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas smashed there grew up two. A huge crab also came to the help of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thydra by biting his foot.

So passing through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPholoe he was entertained by the centaur Pholus, a son of Silenus by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Melian nymph. He set roast meat before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules, while he himself ate his meat raw. When Hercules called for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twine, he said he feared to open the jar which belonged to the centaurs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin common. But Hercules, bidding him be of good\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourage, opened it, and not long afterwards, scenting the smell, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentaurs arrived at the cave of Pholus, armed with rocks and firs. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst who dared to enter, Anchius and Agrius, were repelled by Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a shower of brands, and the rest of them he shot and pursued as far\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas Malea. Thence they took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea. As the centaurs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcowered about Chiron, Hercules shot an arrow at them, which, passing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron. Distressed at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timmortal. However, Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this stead, and so Chiron died. The rest of the centaurs fled in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent directions, and some came to Mount Malea, and Eurytion to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPholoe, and Nessus to the river Evenus. The rest of them Poseidon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treceived at Eleusis and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t hid them in a mountain. But Pholus, drawing the arrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a corpse, wondered that so little a thing could kill such big\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfellows; howbeit, it slipped from his hand and lighting on his foot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled him on the spot. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Hercules returned to Pholoe, he beheld Pholus dead; and he buried\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim and proceeded to the boar hunt. And when he had chased the boar with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshouts from a certain thicket, he drove the exhausted animal into deep\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsnow, trapped it, and brought it to Mycenae . \n ",
                "4":"\n \n The fifth labour he laid on him was to carry out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dung of the cattle of Augeas in a single day. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugeas was king of Elis ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome say that he was a son of the Sun, others that he was a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoseidon, and others that he was a son of Phorbas; and he had many herds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof cattle. Hercules accosted him, and without revealing the command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus, said that he would carry out the dung in one day, if Augeas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould give him the tithe of the cattle. Augeas was incredulous, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised. Having taken Augeas's son Phyleus to witness, Hercules made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbreach in the foundations of the cattle-yard, and then, diverting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses of the Alpheus and Peneus, which flowed near each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother, he turned them into the yard, having first made an outlet for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater through another opening. When Augeas learned that this had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplished at the command of Eurystheus, he would not pay the reward;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnay more, he denied that he had promised to pay it, and on that point he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprofessed himself ready to submit to arbitration. The arbitrators having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken their seats, Phyleus was called by Hercules and bore witness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his father, affirming that he had agreed to give him a reward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a rage Augeas, before the voting took place, ordered both Phyleus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules to pack out of Elis . So Phyleus went to Dulichium and dwelt there, and Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepaired to Dexamenus at Olenus . He found\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDexamenus on the point of betrothing perforce his daughter Mnesimache to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe centaur Eurytion, and being called upon by him for help, he slew\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurytion when that centaur came to fetch his bride. But Eurystheus would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot admit this labour either among the ten, alleging that it had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed for hire. \n ",
                "5":"\n \n The sixth labour he enjoined on him was to chase\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taway the Stymphalian birds. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow at the city of Stymphalus in Arcadia was the lake called Stymphalian, embosomed in a deep\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twood. To it countless birds had flocked for refuge, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be preyed upon by the wolves. So when Hercules was at a loss how to drive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe birds from the wood, Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treceived from Hephaestus. By clashing these on a certain mountain that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverhung the lake, he scared the birds. They could not abide the sound,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut fluttered up in a fright, and in that way Hercules shot them. \n ",
                "6":"\n \n The seventh labour he enjoined on him was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbring the Cretan bull. Acusilaus says that this was the bull\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat ferried across Europa for Zeus; but some say it was the bull that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoseidon sent up from the sea when Minos promised to sacrifice to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoseidon what should appear out of the sea. And they say that when he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw the beauty of the bull he sent it away to the herds and sacrificed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother to Poseidon; at which the god was angry and made the bull\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsavage. To attack this bull Hercules came to Crete , and when, in reply to his request\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor aid, Minos told him to fight and catch the bull for himself, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaught it and brought it to Eurystheus, and having shown it to him he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlet it afterwards go free. But the bull roamed to Sparta and all Arcadia , and traversing the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsthmus arrived at Marathon in Attica and harried the inhabitants. \n ",
                "7":"\n \n The eighth labour he enjoined on him was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbring the mares of Diomedes the Thracian to Mycenae . Now this Diomedes was a son of Ares and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Cyrene , and he was king\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Bistones, a very warlike Thracian people, and he owned man-eating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmares. So Hercules sailed with a band of volunteers, and having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverpowered the grooms who were in charge of the mangers, he drove the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmares to the sea. When the Bistones in arms came to the rescue, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitted the mares to the guardianship of Abderus, who was a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermes, a native of Opus in Locris , and a minion of Hercules; but the mares killed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby dragging him after them. But Hercules fought against the Bistones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslew Diomedes and compelled the rest to flee. And he founded a city\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Abdera beside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrave of Abderus who had been done to death, \n and bringing the mares he gave them to Eurystheus. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus let them go, and they came to Mount Olympus , as it is called, and there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were destroyed by the wild beasts. \n ",
                "8":"\n \n The ninth labour he enjoined on Hercules was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbring the belt of Hippolyte. She was queen of the Amazons, who dwelt about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\triver Thermodon, a people great in war; for they cultivated the manly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvirtues, and if ever they gave birth to children through intercourse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the other sex, they reared the females; and they pinched off the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright breasts that they might not be trammelled by them in throwing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjavelin, but they kept the left breasts, that they might suckle. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trest. Hercules was sent to fetch this belt because Admete, daughter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus, desired to get it. So taking with him a band of volunteer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomrades in a single ship he set sail and put in to the island of Paros , which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabited by the sons of Minos, to wit, Eurymedon, Chryses, Nephalion, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilolaus. But it chanced that two of those in the ship landed and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled by the sons of Minos. Indignant at this, Hercules killed the sons of Minos on the spot and besieged the rest closely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttill they sent envoys to request that in the room of the murdered men he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould take two, whom he pleased. So he raised the siege, and taking on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboard the sons of Androgeus, son of Minos, to wit, Alcaeus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSthenelus, he came to Mysia ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the court of Lycus, son of Dascylus, and was entertained by him; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a battle between him and the king of the Bebryces Hercules sided with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLycus and slew many, amongst others King Mygdon, brother of Amycus. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the took much land from the Bebryces and gave it to Lycus, who called it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall Heraclea .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Having put in at the harbor of Themiscyra,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the received a visit from Hippolyte, who inquired why he was come, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to give him the belt. But Hera in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmultitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe queen. So the Amazons in arms charged on horseback down on the ship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut when Hercules saw them in arms, he suspected treachery, and killing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHippolyte stripped her of her belt. And after fighting the rest he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed away and touched at Troy . But it chanced that the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas then in distress consequently on the wrath of Apollo and Poseidon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor desiring to put the wantonness of Laomedon to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproof, Apollo and Poseidon assumed the likeness of men and undertook to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfortify Pergamum for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twages. Therefore Apollo sent a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster, which, carried up by a flood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsnatched away the people of the plain. But as oracles foretold\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliverance from these calamities if Laomedon would expose his daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHesione to be devoured by the sea monster, he exposed her by fastening\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther to the rocks near the sea. \n Seeing her exposed, Hercules promised to save her on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition of receiving from Laomedon the mares which Zeus had given in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompensation for the rape of Ganymede. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn Laomedon's saying that he would give them, Hercules killed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonster and saved Hesione. But when Laomedon would not give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstipulated reward, Hercules put to sea after threatening to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twar on Troy . \n And he touched at Aenus , where he was entertained by Poltys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd as he was sailing away he shot and killed on the Aenian beach a lewd\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow, Sarpedon, son of Poseidon and brother of Poltys. And having come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Thasos and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjugated the Thracians who dwelt in the island, he gave it to the sons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Androgeus to dwell in. From Thasos he proceeded to Torone , and there, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenged to wrestle by Polygonus and Telegonus, sons of Proteus, son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Poseidon, he killed them in the wrestling match. And having brought the belt to Mycenae he gave it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus. \n \n ",
                "9":"\n \n As a tenth labour he was ordered to fetch the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkine of Geryon from Erythia. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErythia was an island near the ocean; it is now called Gadira. This island was inhabited by Geryon, son of Chrysaor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Callirrhoe, daughter of Ocean. He had the body of three men grown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether and joined in one at the waist, but parted in three from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflanks and thighs. He owned red kine, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Eurytion was the herdsman and Orthus, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe two-headed hound, begotten by Typhon on Echidna, was the watchdog.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo journeying through Europe \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto fetch the kine of Geryon he destroyed many wild beasts and set foot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Libya , and proceeding to Tartessus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the erected as tokens of his journey two pillars over against each other at the boundaries of Europe and Libya . But being heated by the Sun on his journey, he bent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this bow at the god, who in admiration of his hardihood, gave him a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgolden goblet in which he crossed the ocean. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd having reached Erythia he lodged on Mount Abas. However the dog,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperceiving him, rushed at him; but he smote it with his club, and when the herdsman Eurytion came to the help of the dog,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules killed him also. But Menoetes, who was there pasturing the kine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Hades, reported to Geryon what had occurred, and he, coming up with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules beside the river Anthemus, as he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdriving away the kine, joined battle with him and was shot dead. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules, embarking the kine in the goblet and sailing across to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTartessus, gave back the goblet to the Sun. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassing through Abderia he came to Liguria , where Ialebion and Dercynus, sons of Poseidon,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattempted to rob him of the kine, but he killed them and went on his way through Tyrrhenia. But at Rhegium a bull broke\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taway \n and hastily plunging into the sea swam across to Sicily , and having passed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the neighboring country since called Italy after it, for the Tyrrhenians called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bull italus , came to the plain of Eryx , who reigned over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElymi. Now Eryx was a son of Poseidon, and he mingled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bull with his own herds. So Hercules entrusted the kine to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHephaestus and hurried away in search of the bull. He found it in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\therds of Eryx, and when the king refused to surrender it unless Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould beat him in a wrestling bout, Hercules beat him thrice, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the wrestling, and taking the bull drove it with the rest of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\therd to the Ionian Sea. But when he came to the creeks of the sea, Hera\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafflicted the cows with a gadfly, and they dispersed among the skirts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mountains of Thrace .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules went in pursuit, and having caught some, drove them to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Hellespont ; but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder were thenceforth wild. Having with difficulty collected the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcows, Hercules blamed the river Strymon, and whereas it had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnavigable before, he made it unnavigable by filling it with rocks; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the conveyed the kine and gave them to Eurystheus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrificed them to Hera. \n ",
                "10":"\n \n When the labours had been performed in eight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears and a month, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus ordered Hercules, as an eleventh labour, to fetch golden\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapples from the Hesperides, for he did not acknowledge the labour\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the cattle of Augeas nor that of the hydra. These apples were not, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome have said, in Libya ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut on Atlas among the Hyperboreans. They were presented\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t< by Earth> to Zeus after his marriage with Hera, and guarded by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan immortal dragon with a hundred heads, offspring of Typhon and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEchidna, which spoke with many and divers sorts of voices. With it the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHesperides also were on guard, to wit, Aegle, Erythia, Hesperia, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArethusa. So journeying he came to the river Echedorus. And Cycnus, son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Ares and Pyrene, challenged him to single combat. Ares championed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcause of Cycnus and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the two and parted the combatants. And going on foot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough Illyria and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thastening to the river Eridanus he came to the nymphs, the daughters of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus and Themis. They revealed Nereus to him, and Hercules seized him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he slept, and though the god turned himself into all kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshapes, the hero bound him and did not release him till he had learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom him where were the apples and the Hesperides. Being informed, he traversed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Libya . That country was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthen ruled by Antaeus, son of Poseidon, who used to kill\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangers by forcing them to wrestle. Being forced to wrestle with him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he touched earth so\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarth. After Libya he traversed Egypt . That country was then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\truled by Busiris, a son of Poseidon by Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphus. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiris used to sacrifice strangers on an altar of Zeus in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a certain oracle. For Egypt was visited with dearth for nine years, and Phrasius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta learned seer who had come from Cyprus , said that the dearth would cease if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey slaughtered a stranger man in honor of Zeus every year. Busiris\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan by slaughtering the seer himself and continued to slaughter the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangers who landed. So Hercules also was seized and haled to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taltars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Busiris and his son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmphidamas. \n And traversing Asia he put in to Thermydrae, the harbor of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Lindians. And having loosed one of the bullocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the cart of a cowherd, he sacrificed it and feasted. But the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcowherd, unable to protect himself, stood on a certain mountain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcursed. Wherefore to this day, when they sacrifice to Hercules, they do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit with curses. \n \n And passing by Arabia he slew Emathion, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTithonus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjourneying through Libya to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe outer sea he received the goblet from the Sun. And having crossed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite mainland he shot on the Caucasus the eagle, offspring of Echidna\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand Typhon, that was devouring the liver of Prometheus, and he released\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrometheus, after choosing for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thimself the bond of olive, and to Zeus he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpresented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin his stead. Now Prometheus had told Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to go himself after the apples but to send Atlas, first relieving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim of the burden of the sphere; so when he was come to Atlas in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tland of the Hyperboreans, he took the advice and relieved Atlas. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Atlas had received three apples from the Hesperides, he came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules, and not wishing to support the sphere< he said that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould himself carry the apples to Eurystheus, and bade Hercules hold up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sky in his stead. Hercules promised to do so, but succeeded by craft\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin putting it on Atlas instead. For at the advice of Prometheus he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbegged Atlas to hold up the sky till he should> put a pad on his head. When Atlas heard that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the laid the apples down on the ground and took the sphere from Hercules.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd so Hercules picked up the apples and departed. But some say that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdid not get them from Atlas, but that he plucked the apples himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafter killing the guardian snake. And having brought the apples he gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to Eurystheus. But he, on receiving them, bestowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem on Hercules, from whom Athena got them and conveyed them back\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain; for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n ",
                "11":"\n \n A twelfth labour imposed on Hercules was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbring Cerberus from Hades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow this Cerberus had three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this back the heads of all sorts of snakes. When Hercules was about to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepart to fetch him, he went to Eumolpus at Eleusis , wishing to be initiated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever it was not then lawful for foreigners to be initiated: since he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed to be initiated as the adoptive son of Pylius. But not being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\table to see the mysteries because he had not been cleansed of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter of the centaurs, he was cleansed by Eumolpus and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinitiated. And having come to Taenarum in Laconia , where is the mouth of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe descent to Hades, he descended through it. But when the souls saw him, they fled, save\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeleager and the Gorgon Medusa. And Hercules drew his sword against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGorgon, as if she were alive, but he learned from Hermes that she was an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tempty phantom. And being come near to the gates of Hades he found Theseus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPirithous, him who wooed Persephone in wedlock and was therefore bound\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfast.

But Priam\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thanded over Arisbe to Hyrtacus and married a second wife Hecuba,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Dymas, or, as some say, of Cisseus, or, as others say, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Sangarius and Metope. The first son born\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto her was Hector; and when a second babe was about to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborn Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspread over the whole city and burned it. When Priam learned of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdream from Hecuba, he sent for his son Aesacus, for he was an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterpreter of dreams, having been taught by his mother's father Merops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHe declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand advised that the babe should be exposed. When the babe was born\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPriam gave it to a servant to take and expose on Ida; now the servant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas named Agelaus.

When he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas afterwards surnamed Alexander, because he repelled robbers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefended the flocks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd not long afterwards he discovered his parents. After him Hecuba gave birth to daughters, Creusa, Laodice, Polyxena, and Cassandra. Wishing to gain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCassandra's favours, Apollo promised to teach her the art of prophecy;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe learned the art but refused her favours; hence Apollo deprived her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprophecy of power to persuade. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfterwards Hecuba bore sons, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeiphobus, Helenus, Pammon, Polites, Antiphus, Hipponous, Polydorus, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTroilus: this last she is said to have had by Apollo.

In search\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof her Asopus came to Corinth , and learned from Sisyphus that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ravisher was Zeus. Asopus pursued\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim, but Zeus, by hurling thunderbolts, sent him away back to his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstreams; hence coals are fetched\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto this day from the streams of that river. And having conveyed Aegina to the island then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnamed Oenone, but now called Aegina after her, Zeus cohabited\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith her and begot a son Aeacus on her. As Aeacus was alone in the island, Zeus made the ants into men\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor him. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAeacus married Endeis, daughter of Sciron, by whom he had two sons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeleus and Telamon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut Pherecydes says that Telamon was a friend, not a brother of Peleus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the being a son of Actaeus and Glauce, daughter of Cychreus. Afterwards Aeacus cohabited with Psamathe, daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Nereus, who turned herself into a seal to avoid his embraces, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbegot a son Phocus. \n Now Aeacus was the most pious of men. Therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Greece suffered from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfertility on account of Pelops, because in a war with Stymphalus, king\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Arcadians, being unable to conquer Arcadia , he slew the king under a pretence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof friendship, and scattered his mangled limbs, oracles of the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared that Greece would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe rid of its present calamities if Aeacus would offer prayers on its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbehalf. So Aeacus did offer prayers, and Greece was delivered from the dearth. Even after his death Aeacus is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thonored in the abode of Pluto, and keeps the keys of Hades. \n As Phocus excelled in athletic sports, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrothers Peleus and Telamon plotted against him, and the lot falling on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelamon, he killed his brother in a match by throwing a quoit at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead, and with the help of Peleus carried the body and hid it in a wood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the murder being detected, the two were driven fugitives from Aegina by Aeacus. \n \n ",

Some say that this Erichthonius was a son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Hephaestus and Atthis, daughter of Cranaus, and some that he was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Hephaestus and Athena, as follows: Athena came to Hephaestus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesirous of fashioning arms. But he, being forsaken by Aphrodite, fell\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin love with Athena, and began to pursue her; but she fled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen he got near her with much ado ( for he was lame), he attempted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tembrace her; but she, being a chaste virgin, would not submit to him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand he dropped his seed on the leg of the goddess.

Having been brought up by Athena herself in the precinct, Erichthonius expelled Amphictyon and became\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tking of Athens ; and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tset up the wooden image of Athena in the acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenaea, and married Praxithea, a Naiad nymph, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhom he had a son Pandion. \n ",

Now Nisus perished\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough his daughter's treachery. For he had a purple hair on the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof his head, and an oracle ran that when it was pulled out he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdie; and his daughter Scylla fell in love with Minos and pulled out the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thair. But when Minos had made himself master of Megara , he tied the damsel by the feet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the stern of the ship and drowned her. \n \n When the war lingered on and he could not take\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Athens , he prayed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus that he might be avenged on the Athenians. And the city being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvisited with a famine and a pestilence, the Athenians at first, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobedience to an ancient oracle, slaughtered the daughters of Hyacinth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto wit, Antheis, Aegleis, Lytaea, and Orthaea, on the grave of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeraestus, the Cyclops; now Hyacinth, the father of the damsels, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcome from Lacedaemon and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelt in Athens . But when this was of no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavail, they inquired of the oracle how they could be delivered; and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod answered them that they should give Minos whatever satisfaction he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmight choose. So they sent to Minos and left it to him to claim\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsatisfaction. And Minos ordered them to send seven youths and the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of damsels without weapons to be fodder for the Minotaur. Now the Minotaur\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas confined in a labyrinth, in which he who entered could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot find his way out; for many a winding turn shut off the secret\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutward way. The labyrinth was constructed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaedalus, whose father was Eupalamus, son of Metion, and whose mother\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas Alcippe; for he was an excellent architect and the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinventor of images. He had fled from Athens , because he had thrown down from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacropolis Talos, the son of his sister Perdix; for Talos was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this pupil, and Daedalus feared that with his talents he might surpass\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thimself, seeing that he had sawed a thin stick with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjawbone of a snake which he had found. But the corpse was discovered; Daedalus was tried in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAreopagus, and being condemned fled to Minos. And there Pasiphae having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen in love with the bull of Poseidon, Daedalus acted as her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplice by contriving a wooden cow, and he constructed the labyrinth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto which the Athenians every year sent seven youths and as many damsels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be fodder for the Minotaur. \n "
