In this work Laurentius is\n introduced, a Roman, a man of distinguished fortune, giving a banquet in his own\n house to men of the highest eminence for every kind of learning and\n accomplishment; and there is no sort of gentlemanly knowledge which he does not\n mention in the conversation which he attributes to them; for he has put down in\n his book, fish, and their uses, and the meaning of their names; and he has\n described divers kinds of vegetables, and animals of all sorts. He has introduced\n also men who have written histories, and poets, and, in short, clever men of all\n sorts; and he discusses musical instruments, and quotes ten thousand jokes: he\n talks of the different kinds of drinking cups, and of the riches of kings, and the\n size of ships, and numbers of other things which I cannot easily enumerate, and\n the day would fail me if I endeavoured to go through them separately. \n And the arrangement of the conversation is an imitation of a sumptuous banquet;\n and the plan of the book follows the arrangement of the conversation. This, then,\n is the delicious feast of words which this admirable master of the feast, Athen\u00e6us, has prepared for us; and gradually sur- passing\n himself, like the orator at Athens, as he warms with his subject, he bounds on\n towards the end of the book in noble strides. \n ","1":"\n And the Deipnosophists who were present at this banquet were, Masyrius, an expounder of the law, and one who had been no superficial\n student of every sort of learning; Magnus . . . .\n [Myrtilus] a poet, a man who in other branches of learning was inferior to no one,\n and who had devoted himself in no careless manner to the whole circle of arts and\n learning; for in everything which he discussed, he appeared as if that was the\n sole thing which he had studied; so great and so various was his learning from his\n childhood. And he was an iambic poet, inferior to no one who has ever lived since\n the time of Archilochus. There were present also Plutarchus,\n and Leonidas of Elis, and Aemilianus the\n Mauritanian, and Z\u00f6ilus, all the most admirable of\n grammarians. \n And of philosophers there were present Pontianus and Democritus, both of Nicomedia; men superior to all their\n contemporaries in the extent and variety of their learning; and Philadelphus of Ptolemais, a man who had not only been bred up from his\n infancy in philosophical speculation, but who was also a man of the highest\n reputation in every part of his life. Of the Cynics, there was one whom he calls\n Cynulcus, who had not only two white dogs following\n him, as they did Telemachus when he went to the assembly, but a more numerous pack\n than even Act\u00e6on had. And of rhetoricians there was a whole troop, in no respect\n inferior to the Cynics. And these last, as well, indeed, as every one else who\n ever opened his mouth, were run down by Uppianus the\n Tyrian, who, on account of the everlasting questions which he keeps putting every\n hour in the streets, and walks, and booksellers' shops, and baths, has got a name\n by which he is better known than by his real one, Ceitouceitus. This man had a rule of his own, to eat nothing without\n saying \u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ; \u1f22 \u03bf\u1f50\n \u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ; In this way, Can we say of the word \u1f65\u03c1\u03b1 that it \u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \n or is applicable to any part of the day? And is the word \u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, or drunk, applicable to a man? Can the word \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, or paunch, be applied to any eatable food? Is\n the name \u03c3\u03cd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 a compound word applicable to\n a boar? \u2014And of physicians there were present Daphnus \n the Ephesian, a man holy both in his art and by his manners, a\n man of no slight insight into the principles of the Academic school; and Galenus of Pergamos, who has published such numbers of\n philosophical and medical works as to surpass all those who preceded him, and who\n is inferior to none of the guests in the eloquence of his descriptions. And Rufinus of Myl\u00e6a.\u2014And of musicians, Alcides of Alexandria, was present. So that the whole party was so\n numerous that the catalogue looks rather like a muster-roll of soldiers, than the\n list of a dinner party. \n ","2":"\n And Athen\u00e6us dramatises his dialogue in imitation of the manner of Plato. And thus\n he begins:\u2014 \n TIMOCRATES. ATHENAEUS. \n \n Tim. Were you, Athen\u00e6us, yourself present at that\n delightful party of the men whom they now call Deipnosophists; which has been so\n much talked of all over the city; or is it only from having heard an account of it\n from others that you spoke of it to your companions? \n \n Ath. I was there myself, Timocrates. \n \n Tim. I wish, then, that you would communicate to us also\n some of that agreeable conversation which you had over your cups; \n Make your hand perfect by a third attempt, \n as the bard of Cyrene says somewhere or other; or must week some one else? \n ","3":"\n Then after a little while he proceeds to the praises of Laurentius, and says that\n he, being a man of a munificent spirit, and one who collected numbers of learned\n men about him, feasted them not only with other things, but also with\n conversation, at one time proposing questions deserving of investigation, and at\n another asking for information himself; not suggesting subjects without\n examination, or in any random manner, but as far as was possible with a critical\n and Socratic discernment; so that every one marvelled at the systematic character\n of his questions. And he says, too, that he was appointed superintendant of the\n temples and sacrifices by that best of all sovereigns Marcus; and that he was no\n less conversant with the literature of the Greeks than with that of his own countrymen. And he calls him a sort of Asterop\u00e6us, equally\n acquainted with both languages. And he says that he was well versed in all the\n religious ceremonies instituted by Romulus, who gave his name to the city, and by\n Numa Pompilius; and that he is learned in all the laws of politics; and that he\n has arrived at all this learning solely from the study of ancient decrees and\n resolutions; and from the collection of the laws which (as Eupolis, the comic\n writer, says of the poems of Pindar) are already reduced to silence by the\n disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning. He had also, says he, such a\n library of ancient Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are\n remarkable for such collections; such as Polycrates of Samos, and Pisistratus who\n was tyrant of Athens, and Euclides who was himself also an Athenian, and\n Nicorrates the Samian, and even the kings of Pergamos, and Euripides the poet, and\n Aristotle the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say that our\n countryman Ptolem\u00e6us, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported them\n with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful\n Alexandria. So that a man may fairly quote the verses of Antiphanes and apply them\n to him:\u2014 \n You court the heav'nly muse with ceaseless zeal, \n And seek to open all the varied stores \n Of high philosophy. \n And as the Theban lyric poet says:\u2014 \n Nor less renown'd his hand essays \n To wake the muse's choicest lays, \n Such as the social feast around \n Full oft our tuneful band inspire. \n And when inviting people to his feasts, he causes Rome to be looked upon\n as the common country of all of them. For who can regret what he has left in his\n own country, while dwelling with a man who thus opens his house to all his\n friends. For as Apollodorus the comic poet says:\u2014 \n Whene'er you cross the threshhold of a friend, \n How welcome you may be needs no long time \n To feel assured of; blithe the porter looks, \n \n The house-dog wags his tail, and rubs his nose \n Against your legs; and servants hasten quick, \n Unbidden all, since their lord's secret wish \n Is known full well, to place an easy chair \n To rest your weary limbs. \n \n \n ","4":"\n It would be a good thing if other rich men were like him; since when a man acts in\n a different manner, people are apt to say to him, Why are you so mean You\n tents are full of wine. \n \n Call the elders to the feast, \n Such a course befits you best. \n Such as this was the magnanimity of the great Alexander. And Conon, after\n he had conquered the Laced\u00e6monians in the sea-fight off Cnidus, and fortified the\n Pir\u00e6us, sacrificed a real hecatomb, which deserved the name, and feasted all the\n Athenians. And Alcibiades, who conquered in the chariot race at the Olympic games,\n getting the first, and second, and fourth prizes, (for which victories Euripides\n wrote a triumphal ode,) having sacrificed to Olympian Jupiter, feasted the whole\n assembly. And Leophron did the same at the Olympic games, Simonides of Ceos\n writing a triumphal ode for him. And Empedocles of Agrigentum, having gained the\n victory in the horse race at the Olympic games, as he was himself a Pythagorean,\n and as such one who abstained from meat, made an image of an ox of myrrh, and\n frankincense, and the most expensive spices, and distributed it among all who came\n to that festival. And Ion of Chios, having gained the tragic crown at Athens, gave\n a pot of Chian wine to every Athenian citizen. For Antiphanes says:\u2014 \n For why should any man wealth desire,' \n And seek to pile his treasures higher, \n If it were not to aid his friends in their need, \n And to gain for himself love's and gratitude's meed? \n For all can drink and all can eat, \n And it is not only the richest meat, \n Or the oldest wine in the well-chased bowl \n Which can banish hunger and thirst from the soul. \n And Xenophanes of Chalcedon, and Speusippus the Academic philosopher, and\n Aristotle, have all written drinking sons. \n And in the same manner Gellias of Agrigentum, being a very hospitable man, and\n very attentive to all his guests, gave a tunic and cloak to every one of five\n hundred horsemen who once came to him from Gela in the winter season. \n \n ","5":"\n The sophist uses the word Dinnerchaser, on which Clearchus says that Charmus the\n Syracusan adopted some little versicles and proverbs very neatly to whatever was\n put on the table. As on seeing a fish, he says:\u2014 \n I come from the salt depths of Aegeus' sea. \n And when he saw some ceryces he said\u2014 \n Hail holy heralds ( \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 ), messengers of\n Jove. \n And on seeing tripe, \n Crooked ways, and nothing sound. \n When a well-stuffed cuttlefish is served up, \n Good morrow, fool. \n When he saw some pickled char, \n O charming sight; hence with the vulgar crowd. \n And on beholding a skinned eel, \n \n Beauty when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most. \n \n Many such men then as these, he says, were present at Laurentius's supper;\n bringing books out of their bags, as their contribution to the picnic. And he says\n also that Charmus, having something ready for everything that was served up, as\n has been already said, appeared to the Massenians to be a most accomplished man;\n as also did Calliphanes, who was called the son of Parabrycon, who having copied\n out the beginnings of many poems and other writings, recollected three or four\n stanzas of each, aiming at a reputation for extensive learning, And many other men\n had in their mouths turbots caught in the Sicilian sea, and swimming eels, and the\n trail of the tunny-fish of Pachynum, and kids from Melos, and mullets from\n Sym\u00e6thus. And, of dishes of less repute, there were cockles from Pelorum,\n anchovies from Lipara, turnips from Mantinea, rape from Thebes, and beetroot from\n the Ascr\u00e6ans. And Cleanthes the Tarentine, as Clearchus says, said everything\n while the drinking lasted, in metres. And so did Pamphilus the Sicilian, in this\n way:\u2014 \n Give me a cup of sack, that partridge leg, \n Likewise a pot, or else at least a cheesecake. \n Being, says he, men with fair means, and not forced to earn their dinner\n with their hands,\u2014 \n Bringing baskets full of votes. \n \n \n \n ","6":"\n Archestratus the Syracusan or Geloan, in his work to which Chrysippus gives the\n title of Gastronomy, but Lynceus and Callimachus of Hedypathy, that is Pleasure,\n and which Clearchus calls Deipnology, and others Cookery, (but it is an epic poem,\n beginning, \n Here to all Greece I open wisdom's store;) \n says, \n A numerous party may sit round a table, \n But not more than three, four, or five on one sofa; \n For else it would be a disorderly Babel, \n Like the hireling piratical band of a rover. \n But he does not know that at the feast recorded by Plato there were eight\n and twenty guests present. \n How keenly they watch for a feast in the town, \n And, asked or not, they are sure to go down; \n says Antiphanes; and he adds\u2014 \n Such are the men the state at public cost \n Should gladly feed; \n and always \n Treat them like flies at the Olympic games \n And hang them up an ox to feast upon. \n \n \n ","7":"\n \n \n Winter produces this, that summer bears; \n says the bard of Syracuse. So that it is not easy to put all sorts of things on the\n table at one time; but it is easy to talk of all kinds of subjects at any time.\n Other men have written descriptions of feasts; and Tinachidas of Rhodes has done\n so in an epic poem of eleven books or more; and Numenius the Heraclean, the pupil\n of Dieuchas the physician; and Metreas of Pitane, the man who wrote parodies; and\n Hegemon of Thasos, surnamed Phac\u00e8, whom some men reckon among the writers of the\n Old Comedy. And Artemidorus, the false Aristophanes, collected a number of sayings\n relating to cookery. And Plato, the comic writer, mentions in his Phaon the\n banquet of Philoxenus the Leucadian. \n \n \n A. But I have sought this tranquil solitude, \n To ponder deeply on this wondrous book. \n \n B. I pray you, what's the nature of its treasures \n \n A. \n Sauce for the million, by Philoxenus. \n \n B. Oh, let me taste this wisdom. A. Listen then; \n \n I start with onions, and with tunnies end.\" \n \n \n B. With tunnies? Surely, then, he keeps the best \n And choicest of his dishes for the last. \n \n A. Listen. In ashes first your onions roast \n Till they are brown as toast, \n Then with sauce and gravy cover; \n Eat them, you'll be strong all over. \n So much for earth; now list to me, \n While I speak of the sons of the sea. \n \n And presently he says:\u2014 \n \n A good large flat dish is not bad, \n But a pan is better when 'tis to be had. \n \n And presently again:\u2014 \n \n Never cut up a sardine \n Or mackarel of silv'ry sheen, \n Lest the gods should scorn a sinner\u2014 \n Such as you, and spoil your dinner; \n But dress them whole and serve them up, \n And so you shall most richly sup. \n Good sized polypus in season \n Should be boil'd,\u2014to roast them's treason; \n But if early and not big, \n Roast them; boil'd ain't worth a fig. \n Mullets, though the taste is good, \n Are by far too weakening food; \n And the ills it brings to master \n You will need a scorpion plaster. \n \n ","8":"\n And it is from this Philoxenus that the Philoxenean cheesecakes are named; and\n Chrysippus says of him, \"I know an epicure, who carried his disregard of his\n neighbours to such an extent, that he would at the bath openly put in his hand to\n accustom it to the warm water, and who would rinse out his mouth with warm water,\n in order to be less affected by heat. And they said that he used to gain over the\n cooks to set very hot dishes before him, so that he might have them all to\n himself, as no one else could keep up with him. And they tell the same story about\n Philoxenus of Cythera, and about Archytas, and many more, one of whom is\n represented by Cromylus, the comic writer, as saying: \n I've fingers Id\u00e6an to take\n up hot meat, \n And a throat to devour it too; \n Curries and devils are my sweetest treat, \n Not more like a man than a flue. \n \n But Clearchus says that Philoxenus would, after he had bathed,\n both when in his own country and in other cities, go round to men's houses, with\n his slaves following him, carrying oil, and wine, and pickle juice, and vinegar,\n and other condiments; and that so, going into other persons' houses he would\n season what was dressed for them, putting in whatever was requisite; and then,\n when he had finished his labours, he would join the banquet. He, having sailed to\n Ephesus, finding the market empty, asked the reason; and learning that everything\n had been bought up for a wedding feast, bathed, and without any invitation went to\n the bridegroom's house, and then after the banquet he sang a wedding song, which\n began\u2014 \n O Marriage, greatest of the gods, \n in such a manner as to delight every one, for he was a dithyrambic poet.\n And the bridegroom said, Philoxenus, are you going to dine here\n to-morrow? \n Certainly, said he, if no one sells any meat in the\n market. \n \n ","9":"\n But Theophilus says:\u2014\"We should not act like Philoxenus, the son of Eryxis; for\n he, blaming, as it seems, the niggardliness of nature, wished to have the neck of\n a crane for the purposes of enjoyment. But it would be better still to wish to be\n altogether a horse, or an ox, or a camel, or an elephant; for in the case of those\n animals the desires and pleasures are greater and more vehement; for they limit\n their enjoyments only by their power. And Clearchus says that Melanthius did pray\n in this way, saying, Melanthius seems to have been wiser than Tithonus; for\n this last, having desired immortality, is hung up in a basket; being deprived\n of every sort of pleasure by old age. But Melanthius, being devoted to\n pleasure, prayed to have the neck of an ostrich, in order to dwell as long as\n possible on sweet things. \n \n The same Clearchus says that Pithyllus, who was called Tenthes, not only had a\n covering to his tongue made o skin, but that he also wrapped up his tongue for the\n sake of luxury, and then that he rubbed it clean again with the skin of a fish.\n And he is the first of the epicures who is said to have eaten his meat with\n fingerstalls on, in order to convey it to his mouth as warm as possible. And\n others call Philoxenus Philicthus; but Aristotle\n simply calls him Philodeipnus, \n writing in this way:\u2014 Those who make harangues to the\n multitude, spend the whole day in looking at jugglers and mountebanks, and men\n who arrive from the Phasis or the Borysthenes; having never read a book in\n their lives except The Banquet of Philoxenus, and not all of that. \n \n ","10":"\n But Phanias says that Philoxenus of Cythera, a poet, being exceedingly fond of\n eating, once when he was supping with Dionysius, and saw a large mullet put before\n him and a small one before himself, took his up in his hands and put it to his\n ear; and, when Dionysius asked him why he did so, Philoxenus said that he was\n writing Galatea, and so he wished to ask the fish some of the news in the kingdom\n of Nereus; and that the fish which he was asking said that he knew nothing about\n it, as he had been caught young; but that the one which was set before Dionysius\n was older, and was well acquainted with everything which he wished to know. On\n which Dionysius laughed, and sent him the mullet which had been set before\n himself. And Dionysius was very fond of drinking with Philoxenus, but when he\n detected him in trying to seduce Galatea, whom he himself was in love with, he\n threw him into the stone quarries; and while there he wrote the Cyclops,\n constructing the fable with reference to what had happened to himself;\n representing Dionysius as the Cyclops, and the flute-player as Galatea, and\n himself as Ulysses. \n ","11":"\n About the time of Tiberius there lived a man named Apicius; very rich and\n luxurious; from whom several kinds of cheesecakes are called Apician. He spent\n myriads of drachms on his belly, living chiefly at Minturn\u00e6, a city of Campania,\n eating very expensive crawfish, which are found in that place superior in size to\n those of Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing too that they were\n very large in Africa, he sailed thither, without waiting a single day, and\n suffered exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the place, before he\n disembarked from the ship, (for his arrival made a great noise among the\n Africans,) the fishermen came alongside in their boats and brought him some very\n fine crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had any finer; and when\n they said that there were none finer than those which they brought, he,\n recollecting those at Minturn\u00e6, ordered the master of the ship to sail back the\n same way into Italy, without going near the land. But Aristoxenus, the philosopher of Cyrene, a real devotee of the philosophy of\n his country, (from whom, hams cured in particular way are called Aristoxeni,) out\n of his prodigious luxury used to syringe the lettuces which grew in his garden\n with mead in the evening, and then, when he picked them in the morning, he would\n say that he was eating green cheesecakes, which were sent up to him by the\n Earth. \n ","12":"\n When the emperor Trajan was in Parthia, at a distance of many days' journey from\n the sea, Apicius sent him fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever\n contrivance of his own; real oysters, not like the sham anchovies which the cook\n of Nicomedes, king of the Bithynians, made in imitation of the real fish, and set\n before the king, when he expressed a wish for anchovies, (and he too at the time\n was a long way from the sea.) And in Euphron, the comic writer a cook says:\u2014\n \n \n A. I am a pupil of Soterides, \n Who, when his king was distant from the sea \n Full twelve days' journey, and in winter's depth, \n Fed him with rich anchovies to his wish, \n And made the guests to marvel. \n \n B. How was that? \n \n A. He took a female turnip, shred it fine \n Into the figure of the delicate fish; \n Then did he pour on oil and savoury salt \n With careful hand in due proportion. \n On that he strew'd twelve grains of poppy seed, \n Food which the Scythians love; then boil'd it all. \n And when the turnip touch'd the royal lips, \n Thus spake the king to the admiring guests: \n \"A cook is quite as useful as a poet, \n And quite as wise, and these anchovies show it.\" \n \n \n ","13":"\n Archilochus, the Parian poet, says of Pericles, that he would often come to a\n banquet without being invited, after the fashion of the Myconians. But it seems to\n me that the Myconians are calumniated as sordid and covetous because of their\n poverty, and because they live in a barren island. At all events Cratinus calls\n Ischomachus of Myconos sordid. \n \n A. But how can you be generous, if the son \n Of old Ischomachus of Myconos? \n \n B. I, a good man, may banquet with the good, \n For friends should have all their delights in common. \n Archilochus says:\u2014 \n You come and drink full cups of Chian wine, \n And yet give no return for them, nor wait \n \n To be invited, as a friend would do. \n Your belly is your god, and thus misleads \n Your better sense to acts of shamelessness. \n And E\u0169bulus, the comic writer, says somewhere:\u2014 \n We have invited two unequaled men, \n Philocrates and eke Philocrates. \n For that one man I always count as two, \n I don't know that I might not e'en say three. \n They say that once when he was ask'd to dinner, \n To come when first the dial gave a shade \n Of twenty feet, he with the lark uprose, \n Measuring the shadow of the morning sun, \n Which gave a shade of twenty feet and two. \n Off to his host he went, and pardon begg'd \n For having been detain'd by business; \n A man who came at daybreak to his dinner! \n Amphis, the comic writer, says:\u2014 \n A man who comes late to a feast, \n At which he has nothing to pay, \n Will be sure if in battle he's press'd, \n To run like a coward away. \n And Chrysippus says:\u2014 \n Never shun a banquet gay, \n Where the cost on others falls; \n Let them, if they like it, pay \n For your breakfasts, dinners, balls. \n And Antiphanes says:\u2014 \n More blest than all the gods is he, \n Whom every one is glad to see, \n Who from all care and cost is free. \n And again:\u2014 \n Happy am I, who never have cause \n To be anxious for meat to put in my jaws. \n I prepared all these quotations beforehand, and so came to the dinner,\n having studied beforehand in order to be able to pay my host a rent, as it were,\n for my entertainment. \n \n For bards make offerings which give no smoke. \n \n The ancients had a word, \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, applied to\n those who eat alone. And so Antiphanes says:\u2014 \n \n But if you sulk, \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd, \n \n Why must I, too, eat alone? \n \n And Ameipsias says:\u2014 \n \n And if she's a \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, plague take her, \n I'd guard against her as a base housebreaker. \n \n \n ","14":"\n Dioscorides, with respect to the laws praised in Homer, says, \"The poet, seeing\n that temperance was the most desirable virtue for young men, and also the first of\n all virtues, and one which was becoming to every one; and that which, as it were,\n was the guide to all other virtues, wishing to implant it from the very beginning\n in every one, in order that men might devote their leisure to and expend their\n energies on honourable pursuits, and might become inclined to do good to, and to\n share their good things with others; appointed a simple and independent mode of\n life to every one; considering that those desires and pleasures which had\n reference to eating and drinking were those of the greater power, and of the\n highest estimation, and moreover innate in all men; and that those men who\n continued orderly and temperate in respect of them, would also be temperate and\n well regulated in other matters. Accordingly, he laid down a simple mode of life\n for every one, and enjoined the same system indifferently to kings and private\n individuals, and young men and old, saying\u2014 \n The tables in fair order spread, \n They heap the glittering canisters with bread, \n Viands of simple kinds allure the taste, \n Of wholesome sort, a plentiful repast. \n \n Their meat being all roasted, and chiefly beef; and he never sets before\n his heroes anything except such dishes as these, either at a sacred festival, or\n at a marriage feast, or at any other sort of convivial meeting. And this, too,\n though he often represents Agamemnon as feasting the chiefs. And Menelaus makes a\n feast on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Hermione; and again on the\n occasion of the marriage of his son; and also when Telemachus comes to him\u2014 \n The table groan'd beneath a chine of beef, \n With which the hungry heroes quell'd their grief. \n \n For Homer never puts rissoles, or forcemeat, or cheeseakes, or omelettes\n before his princes, but meat such as was calculated to make them vigorous in body\n and mind. And so too Agamemnon feasted Ajax after his single combat with Hector,\n on a rumpsteak; and in the same way he gives Nestor, who was now of advanced age,\n and Ph\u0153nix too, a roast sirloin of beef. And Homer describes\n Alcinous, who was a man of a very luxurious way of life, as having the same\n dinner; wishing by these descriptions to turn us away from intemperate indulgence\n of our appetites. And when Nestor, who was also a king and had many subjects,\n sacrificed to Neptune on the sea-shore, on behalf of his own dearest and most\n valued friends, it was beef that he offered him. For that is the holiest and most\n acceptable sacrifice to the gods, which is offered to them by religious and\n well-disposed men. And Alcinous, when feasting the luxurious Ph\u00e6acians, and when\n entertaining Ulysses, and displaying to him all the arrangements of his house and\n garden, and showing him the general tenor of his life, gives him just the same\n dinner. And in the same way the poet represents the suitors, though the most\n insolent of men and wholly devoted to luxury, neither eating fish, nor game, nor\n cheesecakes; but embracing as far as he could all culinary artifices, and all the\n most stimulating food, as Menander calls it, and especially such as are called\n amatory dishes, (as Chrysippus says in his Treatise on Honour and Pleasure,) the\n preparation of which is something laborious. \n ","15":"\n Priam also, as the poet represents him, reproaches his sons for looking for\n unusual delicacies; and calls them \n The wholesale murderers of lambs and kids. \n \n Philochorus, too, relates that a prohibition was issued at Athens against\n any one tasting lamb which had not been shorn, on an occasion when the breed of\n sheep appeared to be failing. And Homer, though he speaks of the Hellespont as\n abounding in fish, and though he represents the Ph\u00e6acians as especially addicted\n to navigation, and though he knew of many harbours in Ithaca, and many islands\n close to it, in which there were large flocks of fishes and of wild birds; and\n though he enumerates among the riches of the deep the fact of its producing fish,\n still never once represents either fish or game as being put on the table to eat.\n And in the same way he never represents fruit as set before any one, although\n there was abundance of it; and although he is fond of speaking of it, and although\n he speaks of it as being supplied without end. For he says, Pears upon\n pears, and so on. Moreover, he does not represent his heroes as\n crowned, or anointed, or using perfumes; but he portrays even\n his kings as scorning all such things, and devoting themselves to the maintenance\n of freedom and independence. \n In the same way he allots to the gods a very simple way of life, and plain food,\n namely, nectar and ambrsia; and he represents men as paying them honour with the\n materials of their feasts; making no mention of frankincens, or myrrh, or\n garlands, or luxury of this sort. And he does not describe them as indulging in\n even this plain food to an immoderate extent; but like the most skilful physicians\n he abhors satiety. \n But when their thirst and hunger were appeased; \n \n then, having satisfied their desires, they went forth to athletic\n exercises; amusing themselves with quoits and throwing of javelins, practising in\n their sport such arts as were capable of useful application. And they listened to\n harp players who celebrated the exploits of bygone heroes with poetry and\n song. \n ","16":"\n So that it is not at all wonderful that men who lived in such a way as they did\n were healthy and vigorous both in mind and body. And he, pointing out how\n wholesome and useful a thing moderation is, and how it contributes to the general\n good, has represented Nestor, the wisest of the Greeks, as bringing wine to\n Machaon the physician when wounded in the right shoulder, though wine is not at\n all good for inflammations; and that, too, was Pramnian wine, which we know to be\n very strong and nutritious. And he brings it to him too, not as a relief from\n thirst, but to drink of abundantly; (at all events, when he has drank a good\n draught of it, he recommends him to repeat it.) \n Sit now, and drink your fill, \n says he; and then he cuts a slice of goat-milk cheese, and then an onion,\n \n A shoeing-horn for further draughts of wine; \n \n though in other places he does say that wine relaxes and enervates the\n strength. And in the case of Hector, Hecuba, thinking that then he will remain in\n the city all the rest of the day, invites him to drink and to pour libations,\n encouraging him to abandon himself to pleasure. But he, as he is going out to\n action, puts off the drinking. And she indeed, praises wine without ceasing; but\n he, when he comes in out of breath, will not have any. And she\n urges him to pour a libation and then to drink, but he, as he is all covered with\n blood, thinks it impiety. \n Homer knew also the use and advantages of wine, when he said that if a man drank\n it in too large draughts it did harm. And he was acquainted, too, with many\n different ways of mixing it. For else Achilles would not have bade his attendants\n to mix it for him with more wine than usual, if there had not been some settled\n proportion in which it was usually mixed. But perhaps he was not aware that wine\n was very digestible without any admixture of solid food, which is a thing known to\n the physicians by their art; and, therefore, in the case of people with heartburn\n they mix something to eat with the wine, in order to retain its power. But Homer\n gives Machaon meal and cheese with his wine; and represents Ulysses as connecting\n the advantages to be derived from food and wine with one another when he says\u2014\n \n Strengthen'd with wine and meat, a man goes forth: \n \n and to the reveller gives sweet drink, saying\u2014 \n \n There, too, were casks of old and luscious wine. \n \n \n ","17":"\n Homer, too, represents the virgins and women washing the strangers, knowing that\n men who have been brought up in right principles will not give way to undue warmth\n or violence; and accordingly the women are treated with proper respect. And this\n was a custom of the ancients; and so too the daughters of Cocalus wash Minos on\n his arrival in Sicily, as if it was a usual thing to do. On the other hand, the\n poet, wishing to disparage drunkenness, represents the Cyclops, great as he was,\n destroyed through inebriety by a man of small stature, and also Eurytian the\n Centaur. And he relates how the men at Circe's court were transformed into lions\n and wolves, from a too eager pursuit of pleasure. But Ulysses was saved from\n following the advice of Mercury, by means of which he comes off unhurt. But he\n makes Elpenor, a man given to drinking and luxury, fall down a precipice. And\n Antinous, though he says to Ulysses\u2014 \n Luscious wine will be your bane, \n \n could not himself abstain from drinking, owing to which he was wounded\n and slain while still having hold of the goblet. He represents\n the Greeks also as drinking hard when sailing away from Troy, and on that account\n quarrelling with one another, and in consequence perishing. And he relates that\n Aeneas, the most eminent of the Trojans for wisdom , was led away by the manner in\n which he had talked, and bragged, and made promises to the Trojans, while engaged\n in drinking, so as to encounter the mighty Achilles, and was nearly killed. And\n Agamemnon says somewhere about drunkennes\u2014 \n Disastrous folly led me thus astray, \n Or wine's excess, or madness sent from Jove: \n placing madness and drunkenness in the same boat. And Dioscorides, too,\n the pupil of Isocrates, quoted these verses with the same object, saying, \"And\n Achilles, when reproaching Agamemnon, addresses him\u2014 \n \n Tyrant, with sense and courage quell'd by wine.\" \n \n This was the way in which the sophist of Thessalia argued, from whence came the\n term, a Sicilian proverb, and Athen\u00e6us is, perhaps, playing on the proverb. \n ","18":"\n As to the meals the heroes took in Homer, there was first of all breakfast, which\n he calls \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, which he mentions once in the\n Odyssey, \n Ulysses and the swineherd, noble man, \n First lit the fire, and breakfast then began. \n \n And once in the Iliad, \n Then quickly they prepared to break their fast. \n \n But this was the morning meal, which we call \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2, because we soak crusts of bread in pure wine ( \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ), and eat them, as Antiphanes says\u2014 \n While the cook the \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd prepares. \n And afterwards he says\u2014 \n Then when you have done your business, \n Come and share my \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2. \n \n And Cantharus says\u2014 \n \n A. Shall we, then, take our \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 there? \n \n B. No; at the Isthmus all the slaves prepare \n The sweet \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u2014 \n using the two words as synonymous. Aristomenes says\u2014 \n I'll stop awhile to breakfast, then I'll come, \n When I a slice or two of bread have eaten, \n But Philemon says that the ancients took the following meals\u2014 \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f11\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, or the\n afternoon meal, and \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, , supper; calling the\n \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 breakfast, and \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \n luncheon, and\n \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd the meal which came after luncheon. And\n the same order of names occur in Aeschylus, where Palamedes is introduced, saying\u2014\n \n The different officers I then appointed, \n And bade them recollect the soldiers' meals, \n In number three, first breakfast, and then dinner, \n Supper the third. \n And of the fourth meal Homer speaks thus\u2014 \n \n And come thou \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2. \n \n \n \n That which some call \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd is between what we\n call \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd and \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ; and \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd in Homer, that\n which is taken in the morning, \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd is what is\n taken at noon, which we call \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, and \u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd is the name for the evening meal. Sometimes,\n then, \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd is synonymous with \u03b4\u03b5\u0342\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ; for somewhere or other Homer says\u2014 \n \n \u03b4\u03b5\u0342\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd they took, then arm'd them for the\n fray. \n For making their \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd immediately\n after sunrise, they then advance to battle. \n ","19":"\n In Homer they eat sitting down; but some think that a separate table was set\n before each of the feasters. At all events, they say a polished table was set\n before Mentes when he came to Telemachus, arriving after tables were already laid\n for the feast. However, this is not very clearly proved, for Minerva may have\n taken her food at Telemachus's table. But all along the banqueting-room full\n tables were laid out, as is even now the custom among many nations of the\n barbarians, \n Laden with all dainty dishes, \n as Anacreon says. And then when the guests have departed, the\n handmaidens \n \n Bore off the feast, and clear'd the lofty hall, \n Removed the goblets and the tables all. \n \n \n The feast which he mentions as taking place in the palace of Menelaus is of a\n peculiar character; for there he represents the guests as conversing during the\n banquet and then they wash their hands and return to the board, ad proceed to\n supper after having indulged their grief. But the line in the last book of the\n Iliad, which is usually read, \n He eat and drank, while still the table stood, \n should be read, \n He eat and drank still, while the table stood, \n or else there would be blame implied for what Achilles was doing at the\n moment; for how could it be decent that a table should be laid before Achilles, as\n before a party of revellers, down the whole length of a banqueting-room? Bread,\n then, was placed on the table in baskets, and the rest of the meal consisted\n wholly of roast meat. But Homer never speaks of broth, Antiphanes says, \n He never boil'd the legs or haunches, \n But roasted brains and roasted paunches, \n As did his sires of old. \n \n \n ","20":"\n And portions of the meat were then distributed among the guests; from which\n circumstances he speaks of equal feasts, because of their equal\n division. And he calls suppers \u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, from the\n word \u03b4\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to divide, since not only was the\n meat distributed in that way, but the wine also. \n Their hunger was appeased, \n And strength recruited by the equal feast. \n \n And again, \n Come, then, Achilles, share this equal feast. \n \n From these passages Zenodotus got the idea that \u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1 \n \u1f10\u0390\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd meant a good feast; for as food is a\n necessary good to men, he says that he, by extension of the meaning of the word,\n called it \u1f10\u0390\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd. But men in the early times, as\n they had not food in sufficient abundance, the moment any appeared, rushed on it\n all at once, and tore it to pieces with violence, and even took it away from\n others who had it; and this disorderly behaviour gave rise to bloodshed. A d it is\n from this that very probably the word \u1f00\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \n originated, because it was in \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, another name\n for banquets, tat men first offended against one another. But when, by the bounty\n of Ceres, food became abundant, then they distributed an\n equal portion to each individual, and so banquets became orderly entertainments.\n Then came the invention of wine and of sweetmeats, which were also distributed\n equally: and cups, too, were given to men to drink out of, and these cups all held\n the same quantity. And as food was called \u03b4\u03b1\u1f76\u03c2, \n from \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, that is, from being divided, so he\n who roasted the meat was called \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2, because\n it was he who gave each guest an equal portion. We must remark that the poet uses\n the word \u03b4\u03b1\u1f76\u03c2 only of what is eaten by men, and\n never applies it to beasts; so that it was out of ignorance of the force of this\n word that Zenodotus, in his edition writes:\u2014 \n \n \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f11\u03bb\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c7\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \n \n \n \u03bf\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1, \n \n \n calling the food of the vultures and other birds by this name, though it\n is man alone who has come to an equal division after his previous violence, on\n which account it is his food alone that is called \u03b4\u03b1\u1f76\u03c2, and the portion given to him is called \u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1. But the feasters mentioned in Homer did not carry home the\n fragments, but when they were satisfied they left them with the givers of the\n feast; and the housekeeper took them in order, if any stranger arrived, to have\n something to give him. \n ","21":"\n Now Homer represents the men of his time as eating fish and birds: at all events,\n in Sicily the companions of Ulysses catch \n All fish and birds, and all that come to hand \n With barbed hooks. \n \n But as the hooks were not forged in Sicily, but were brought by them in\n their vessel; it is plain that they were fond of and skilful in catching fish. And\n again, the poet compares the companions of Ulysses, who were seized by Sylla, to\n fish caught with a long rod and thrown out of doors; and he speaks more accurately\n concerning this act than those who have written poems or treatises professedly on\n the subject. I refer to C\u00e6cilius of Argos, and Numenius of Heraclea, and Pancrates\n the Arcadian, and Posidonius the Corinthian, and Oppianus the Cilician, who lived\n a short time ago; for we know of all those men as writers of\n heroic poems about fishing. And of prose essayists on the subject we have Seleucus\n of Tarsus, and Leonidas of Byzantium, and Agathocles of Atracia. But he never\n expressly mentions such food at his banquets, just as he also forbears to speak f\n the meat of young animals, as such food was hardly considered suitable to the\n dignity of heroes of reputation. However, they did eat not only fish, but oysters;\n though this sort of food is neither very wholesome nor very nice, but the oysters\n lie at the bottom of the sea, and one cannot get at them by any other means,\n except by diving to the bottom. \n An active man is he, and dives with ease; \n \n as he says of a man who could have collected enough to satisfy many men,\n while hunting for oysters. \n ","22":"\n Before each one of the guests in Homer is placed a separate cup. Demodocus has a\n basket and a table and a cup placed before him, \n To drink whene'er his soul desired. \n \n Again the goblets are crowned with drink; that is\n to say, they are filled so that the liquor stands above the brim, and the cups\n have a sort of crown of wine on them. Now the cupbearers filled them so for the\n sake of the omen; and then they pour out \n \n \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03be\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \n \n \n the word \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd referring not to the cups\n but to the men. Accordingly Alcinous says to Pontonous, \n Let all around the due libation pay \n To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way; \n \n and then he goes on, \n All drink the juice that glads the heart of man. \n And due honour is paid at those banquets to all the most eminent men.\n Accordingly, Tydides is honoured with great quantities of meat and wine; and Ajax\n receives the compliment of a whole chine of beef. And the kings are treated in the\n same way:\u2014 \n A rump of beef they set before the king: \n \n \n that is, before Menelaus. And in like manner he honours\n Idomeneus and Agamemnon \n With ever brimming cups of rosy wine. \n \n And Sarpedon, among the Lycians, receives the same respect, and has the\n highest seat, and the most meat. \n They had also a way of saluting in drinking one another's health; and so even the\n gods, \n In golden goblets pledged each other's health; \n that is, they took one another by the right hand while drinking. And so\n some one \u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u02bc \u02bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, which is the same as\n if he had said \u1f10\u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf, that is, took him by the\n right hand. He drank to him, proffering him the goblet in his right hand. They\n also gave some of their own portion to those to whom they wished to show\n attention; as, Ulysses having cut off a piece of chine of beef which was set\n before himself, sent it to Demodocus. \n ","23":"\n They also availed themselves at their banquets of the services of minstrels and\n dancers; as the suitors did, and in the palace of Menelaus \n A band amid the joyous circle sings \n High airs at tempered to the vocal strings; \n While, warbling to the varied strain, advance \n Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance. \n \n And though Homer uses \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03c0\u1f74, \n warbling, here, he is really speaking only of the exercise\n of the dance. But the race of bards in those days was modest and orderly,\n cultivating a disposition like that of philosophers. And accordingly Agamemnon\n leaves his bard as a guardian and counsellor to Clyt\u00e6mnestra: who, first of all,\n going through all the virtues of women, endeavoured to inspire her with an\n ambition of excelling in virtuous and ladylike habits; and, after that, by\n supplying her with agreeable occupation, sought to prevent her inclinations from\n going astray after evil thoughts: so that Aegisthus could not seduce the woman\n till he had murdered the bard on a desert island. And the same is the character of\n that bard who sings under compulsion before the suitors; who bitterly reproached\n them for laying plots against Penelope. We find too that using one general term, Homer calls all bards objects of veneration among men.\n \n Therefore the holy Muse their honour guards \n In every land, and loves the race of bards. \n \n And Demodocus the bard of the Ph\u0153acians sins of the intrigue between Mars\n and Venus; not because he approves of such behaviour, but for the purpose of\n dissuading his hearers from the indulgence of such passions, knowing that they\n have been brought up in a luxurious way, and therefore relating to them tales not\n inconsistent with their own manners, for the purpose of pointing out to them the\n evil of then, and persuading them to avoid such conduct. And Phemius sings to the\n suitors, in compliance with their desire, the tale of the return of the Greeks\n from Troy; and the sirens sing to Ulysses what they think will be most agreeable\n to him, saying what they think most akin to his own ambition and extensive\n learning. We know, say they, \n Whate'er beneath the sun's bright journey lies, \n Oh stay and learn new wisdom from the wise. \n \n \n \n ","24":"\n The dances spoken of in Homer are partly those of tumblers and partly those of\n ball-players; the invention of which last kind Agallis, the Corcyrean authoress,\n who wrote on grammar, attributes to Nausicaa, paying a compliment to her own\n countrywoman; but Dic\u00e6archus attributes it to the Sicyonians. But Hippasus gives\n the credit of both this and gymnastic exercises to the Laced\u00e6monians. However,\n Nausicaa is the only one of his heroines whom Homer introduces playing at ball.\n Demoteles, the brother of Theognis the Chiansophist, was eminent for his skill in\n this game; and a man of the name of Ch\u00e6rephanes, who once kept following a\n debauched young man, and did not speak to him, but prevented him from misbehaving.\n And when he said, Ch\u00e6rephanes, you may make your own terms with me, if you\n will only desist from following me; \n Do you think, said he, that I want to speak to you? \n If you do not, said he, why do you follow me \n I like to look at you, he replied, but I do not approve of\n your conduct. \n \n The thing called \u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, , which appears to\n have been a kind of small ball, was invented by Atticus the Neapolitan, the tutor\n in gymnastics of the great Pompey. And n the game of ball the\n variation called \u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd used to be called\n \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1, and I think that the best of all the\n games of ball. \n ","25":"\n There is a great deal of exertion and labour in a game of ball, and it causes\n great straining of the neck and shoulders. Antiphanes says, \n Wretch that I am, my neck's so stiff; \n and again Antiphanes describes the \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 thus:\u2014 \n The player takes the ball elate, \n And gives it safely to his mate, \n Avoids the blows of th' other side, \n And shouts to see them hitting wide; \n List to the cries, Hit here, \n hit there, ' \n \n Too far, \n too high, \n that is not fair, \u2014 \n See every man with ardour burns \n To make good strokes and quick returns. \n And it was called \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 from the rapid\n motion of those who played, or else because its inventor, as Juba the Mauritanian\n says, was Ph\u00e6nestius, a master of gymnastics. And Antiphanes, \n To play Ph\u00e6ninda at Ph$anestius' school. \n And those who played paid great attention to elegance of motion and\n attitude; and accordingly Demoxenus says:\u2014 \n A youth I saw was playing ball, \n Seventeen years of age and tall; \n From Cos he came, and well I wot \n The Gods look kindly on that spot. \n For when he took the ball or threw it, \n So pleased were all of us to view it, \n We all cried out; so great his grace, \n Such frank good humour in his face, \n That every time he spoke or moved, \n All felt as if that youth they loved. \n Sure ne'er before had these eyes seen, \n Nor ever since, so fair a mien; \n Had I staid long most sad my plight \n Had been to lose my wits outright, \n And even now the recollection \n Disturbs my senses' calm reflection. \n \n \n Ctesibius also of Chalcis, a philosopher, was no bad player. And there were many\n of the friends of Antigonus the king who used to take their coats off and play\n ball with him. Timocrates, too, the Laced\u00e6monian, wrote a book on playing\n ball. \n ","26":"\n But the Ph\u00e6acians in Homer had a dance also uncon- nected with\n ball playing; and they danced very cleverly, alternating in figures with one\n another. That is what is meant by the expression, \n In frequent interchanges, \n while others stood by and made a clapping noise with their fore-fingers,\n which is called \u03bb\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd. The poet was acquainted\n also with the art of dancing so as to keep time with singing. And while Demodocus\n was singing, youths just entering on manhood were dancing; and in the book which\n is called the Manufacture of the Arms, a boy played the harp, \n Danced round and sung in soft well measured tune. \n And in these passages the allusion is to that which is called the\n hyporchematic style, which flourished in the time of Xenodemus and Pindar. And this kind\n of dance is an imitation of actions which are explained by words, and is what the\n elegant Xenophon represents as having taken place, in his Anabasis, at the banquet\n given by Seuthes the Thracian. He says: \n \"After libations were made, and the guests had sung a p\u00e6an, there rose up first\n the Thracians, and danced in arms to the music of a flute, and jumped up very\n high, with light jumps, and used their swords. And at last one of them strikes\n another, so that it seemed to every one that the man was wounded. And he fell down\n in a very clever manner, and all the bystanders raised an outcry. And he who\n struck him having stripped him of his arms, went out singing Sitalces. And others\n of the Thracians carried out his antagonist as if he were dead; but in reality, he\n was not hurt. After this some Aenianians and Magnesians rose up, who danced the\n dance called Carp\u00e6a, they too being in armour. And the fashion of that dance was\n like this: One man, having laid aside his arms, is sowing, and driving a yoke of\n oxen, constantly looking round as if he were afraid. Then three comes up a robber;\n but the sower, as soon as he sees him snatches up his arms and fights in defence\n of his team in regular time to the music of the flute. And at last the robber,\n having bound the man, carries off the team; but sometimes the\n sower conquers the robber, and then binding him alongside his oxen, he ties his\n hands behind him, and drives him forward. And one man,\" says he, danced the\n Persian dance, and rattling one shield against another, fell down, and rose up\n again: and he did all this in time to the music of a flute. And the Arcadians\n rising up, all moved in time, being clothed in armour, the flute-players\n playing the tune suited to an armed march; and they sung the p\u00e6an, and\n danced. \n \n ","27":"\n The heroes used also flutes and pipes. At all events Agamemnon hears the\n voice of flutes and pipes, which however he never introduced into\n banquets, except that in the Manufacture of Arms, he mentions the flute on\n the occasion of a marriage-feast. But flutes he attributes to the barbarians.\n Accordingly, the Trojans had the voice of flutes and pipes, and\n they made libations, when they got up from the feast, making them to Mercury, and\n not, as they did afterwards, to Jupiter the Finisher. For Mercury appears to be\n the patron of sleep: they drop libations to him also on their tongues when they\n depart from a banquet, and the tongues are especially allotted to him, as being\n the instruments of eloquence. \n Homer was acquainted also with a variety of meats. At all events he uses the\n expression various meats, and \n Meats such as godlike kings rejoice to taste. \n He was acquainted, too, with everything that is thought luxurious even in\n our age. And accordingly the palace of Menelaus is the most splendid of houses.\n And Polybius describes the palace of one of the Spanish kings as being something\n similar in its appointments and splendour, saying that he was ambitious of\n imitating the luxury of the Ph\u00e6acians, except as far as there stood in the middle\n of the palace huge silver and golden goblets full of wine made of barley. But\n Homer, when describing the situation and condition of Calypso's house, represents\n Mercury as astonished; and in his descriptions the life of the Ph\u00e6acians is wholly\n devoted to pleasure: \n We ever love the banquet rich, \n The music of the lyre, \n \n and so on. And \n How goodly seems it, etc. etc. \n lines which Eratosthenes says ought to stand thus:\u2014 \n How goodly seems it ever to employ \n Far from all ills man's social days in joy, \n The plenteous board high heap'd with cates divine \n While tuneful songs bid flow the generous wine. \n \n When he says far from all ills, he means where folly is\n not allowed to exhibit itself; for it would be impossible for the Ph\u00e6acians to be\n anything but wise, inasmuch as they are very dear to the gods, as Nausicaa\n says. \n ","28":"\n In Homer, too, the suitors amused themselves in front of the doors of the palace\n with dice; not having learnt how to play at dice from Diodorus of Megalopolis, or\n from Theodorus, or from Leon of Mitylene, who was descended from Athenian\n ancestors: and was absolutely invincible at dice, as Phanias says. But Apion of\n Alexandria says that he had heard from Cteson of Ithaca what sort of game the game\n of dice, as played by the suitors, was. For the suitors being a hundred and eight\n in number, arranged their pieces opposite to one another in equal numbers, they\n themselves also being divided into two equal parties, so that there were on each\n side fifty-four; and between the men there was a small space left empty. And in\n this middle space they placed one man, which they called Penelope. And they made\n this the mark, to see if any one of them could hit it with his man; and then, when\n they had cast lots, he who drew the lot aimed at it. Then if any one hit it and\n drove Penelope forward out of her place, then he put down his own man in the place\n of that which had been hit and moved from its place. After which, standing up\n again, he shot his other man at Penelope in the place in which she was the second\n time. And if he hit her again without touching any one of the other men, he won\n the game, and had great hopes that he should be the man to marry her. He says too\n that Eurymachus gained the greatest number of victories in this game, and was very\n sanguine about his marriage. And in consequence of their luxury the suitors had\n such tender hands that they were not able to bend the bow; and even their servants\n were a very luxurious set. \n \n Homer, too, speaks of the smell of perfumes as something very admirable:\u2014 \n Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets \n The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets. \n \n He speaks, too, of splendid beds; and such is the bed which Arete orders\n her handmaids to prepare for Ulysses. And Nestor makes it a boast to Telemachus\n that he is well provided with such things. \n ","29":"\n But some of the other poets have spoken of the habits of expense and indolence of\n their own time as existing also at the time of the Trojan war; and so Aeschylus\n very improperly introduces the Greeks as so drunk as to break their vessels about\n one another's heads; and he says\u2014 \n This is the man who threw so well \n The vessel with an evil smell, \n And miss'd me not, but dash'd to shivers \n The pot too full of steaming rivers \n Against my head, which now, alas! sir, \n Gives other smells besides macassar. \n And Sophocles says in his banquet of the Greeks, \n He in his anger threw too well \n The vessel with an evil smell \n Against my head, and fill'd the room \n With something not much like perfume; \n So that I swear I nearly fainted \n With the foul steam the vessel vented. \n But Eupolis attacks the man who first mentioned such a thing, saying\u2014\n \n I hate the ways of Sparta's line, \n And would rather fry my dinner; \n He who first invented wine \n Made poor man a greater sinner, \n And through him the greater need is \n Of the arts of Palamedes. \n \n \n \n But in Homer the chiefs banquet in Agamemnon's tent in a very orderly manner; and\n if in the Odyssey Achilles and Ulysses dispute and Agamemnon exults, still their\n rivalry with one another is advantageous, since what they are discussing is\n whether Troy is to be taken by stratagem, or by open-hand fighting. And he does\n not represent even the suitors as drunk, nor has he ever made\n his heroes guilty of such disorderly conduct as Aeschylus and Sophocles have,\n though he does speak of the foot of an ox being thrown at Ulysses. \n ","30":"\n And his heroes sit at their banquets, and do not lie down. And this was sometimes\n the case at the feasts of Alexander the king, as Dures says. For he once, when\n giving a feast to his captains to the number of six thousand, made them sit upon\n silver chairs and couches, having covered them with purple covers. And Hegesander\n says that it was not the custom in Macedonia for any one to lie down at a banquet,\n unless he had slain a boar which had escaped beyond the line of nets; but with\n that exception, every one sat at supper. And so Cassander, when he was thirty-five\n years of age, supped with his father in a sitting posture, not being able to\n perform the above-mentioned exploit, though he was of man's estate, and a gallant\n hunter. \n But Homer, who has always an eye to propriety, has not introduced his heroes\n feasting on anything except meat, and that too they dressed for themselves. For it\n caused neither ridicule nor shame to see them preparing and cooking their own\n food: for they studied to be able to wait upon themselves; and they prided\n themselves, says Chrysippus, on their dexterity in such matters. And accordingly\n Ulysses boasts of being a better hand than any one else at making a fire and\n cutting up meat. And in the book of the Iliad called The Prayers, Patroclus acts as\n cupbearer, and Achilles prepares the supper. And when Menelaus celebrates a\n marriage feast, Megapenthes the bridegroom acts as cupbearer. But now we have come\n to such a pitch of effeminacy as to lie down while at our meals. \n ","31":"\n And lately baths too have been introduced; things which formerly men would not\n have permitted to exist inside a city. And Antiphanes points out their injurious\n character: \n Plague take the bath! just see the plight \n In which the thing has left me; \n It seems t' have boil'd me up, and quite \n Of strength and nerve bereft me. \n Don't touch me, curst was he who taught a \n Man to soak in boiling water. \n \n And Hermippus says, \n As to mischievous habits, if you ask my vote, \n I say there are two common kinds of self-slaughter, \n One, constantly pouring strong wine down your throat, \n T'other plunging in up to your throat in hot water. \n But now the refinements of cooks and perfumers have increased so much,\n that Alexis says that even if a man could bathe in a bath of perfume he would not\n be content. And all the manufactories of sweetmeats are in great vigour, and such\n plans are devised for intercourse between people, that some have proposed even to\n stuff the sofas and chairs with sponge, as on the idea that that will make the\n occupiers more amorous. And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of\n wondrous efficacy in such matters; and Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to\n some of the presents which Sandrocottus, the king of the Indians, sent to\n Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of\n affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love. Music, too, has been\n cultivated now, in a way which is a great perversion of its legitimate use: and\n extravagance has descended even to our clothes and shoes. \n ","32":"\n But Homer, though he was well acquainted with the nature of perfume, has never\n introduced any of his heroes as perfumed except Paris; when he says,\n glittering with beauty, as in another place he says that Venus\u2014\n \n With every beauty every feature arms, \n Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms. \n \n Nor does he ever represent them as wearing crowns, although by some of\n his similes and metaphors he shows that he knew of garlands. At all events he\n speaks of \n That lovely isle crown'd by the foaming waves, \n \n And again he says\u2014 \n For all around the crown of battle swells. \n \n We must remark, too, that in the Odyssey he represents his characters as\n washing their hands before they partake of food. But in the Iliad there is no\n trace of such a custom. For the life described in the Odyssey is that of men\n living easily and luxuriously owing to the peace; on which account the men of that time indulged their bodies with baths and washings. And\n that is the reason why in that state of things they play at dice, and dance, and\n play ball. But Herodotus is mistaken when he says that those sports were invented\n in he time of Atys to amuse the people during the famine. For the heroic times are\n older than Atys. And the men living in the time of the Iliad are almost constantly\n crying out\u2014 \n Raise the battle cry so clear, \n Prelude to the warlike spear. \n \n \n ","33":"\n Now to go back to what we were saying before. The Athenians made Aristonicus the\n Carystian, who used to play at ball with Alexander the king, a freeman of their\n city on account of his skill, and they erected a statue to him. And even in later\n times the Greeks considered all handicraft trades of much less importance than\n inventions which had any reference to amusement. And the people of Histi\u00e6a, and of\n Oreum, erected in their theatre a brazen statue holding a die in its hand to\n Theodorus the juggler. And on the same principle the Milesians erected one to\n Archelaus the harp- player. But at Thebes there is no statue to Pindar, though\n there is one to Cleon the singer, on which there is the inscription\u2014 \n Stranger, thou seest Pytheas' tuneful son, \n While living oft with victory's garlands crown'd, \n Sweet singer, though on earth his race is run, \n E'en the high heavens with his name resound. \n Polemo relates that when Alexander razed Thebes to the ground, one man\n who escaped hid some gold in the garments of this statue, as they were hollow; and\n then when the city was restored he returned and recovered his money after a lapse\n of thirty years. But Herodotus, the logomime as he was called, and Archelaus the\n dancer, according! to Hegesander, were more honoured by Antiochus the king than\n any others of his friends. And Antiochus his father made the sons of Sostratus the\n flute-player his body guards. \n ","34":"\n And Matreas, the strolling player of Alexandria, was admired by both Greeks and\n Romans; and he said that he was cherishing a beast which was eating itself. So\n that even now it is disputed what that beast of Matreas's was. He used to propose\n ridiculous questions in parody of the doubt raised by Aristotle, and then he read\n them in public; as Why is the sun said to set, and not\n to dive? \n why are sponges said to suck up, and not to drink? and why\n do we say of a tetra-drachm that it \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \n when we never\n speak of its getting in a passion? And the Athenians gave Pothimos the\n puppet-master the use of the very stage on which Euripides had exhibited his noble\n dramas. And they also erected a statue of Euripides in the theatre next to the\n statue of Aeschylus. Xenophon the conjuror, too, was very popular among them, who\n left behind him a pupil of the name of Cratisthenes, a citizen of Phlias; a man\n who used to make fire spout up of its own accord, and who contrived many other\n extraordinary sights, so as almost to make men discredit the evidence of their own\n senses. And Nymphodorus the conjuror was another such; a man who having quarrelled\n with the people of Rhegium, as Duris relates, was the first man who turned them\n into ridicule as cowards. And Eudicus the buffoon gained great credit by imitating\n wrestlers and boxers, as Aristoxenus relates. Straton of Tarentum, also, had many\n admirers; he was a mimic of the dithyrambic poets; and so had Aenonas the Italian,\n who mimicked the harp-players; and who gave representations of the Cyclops trying\n to sing, and of Ulysses when shipwrecked, speaking in a clownish fashion. And\n Diopeithes the Locrian, according to the account of Phanodemus, when he came to\n Thebes, fastened round his waist bladders full of wine and milk, and then,\n squeezing them, pretended that he was drawing up those liquids out of his mouth.\n And No\u00ebmon gained a great reputation for the same sort of tricks. \n There were also in Alexander's court the following jugglers, who had all a great\n name. Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse, and Heraclitus of\n Mitylene. And there were too some strolling players of high repute, such as\n Cephisodorus and Pantaleon. And Xenophon makes mention also of Philip the\n buffoon. \n ","35":"\n Rome may fairly be called the nation of the world. And he will not be far out who\n pronounces the city of the Romans an epitome of the whole earth; for in it you may\n see every other city arranged collectively, and many also separately; for\n instance, there you may see the golden city of the Alex- \n andrians, the beautiful metropolis of Antioch, the surpassing beauty of Nicomedia;\n and besides all these that most glorious of all the cities which Jupiter has ever\n display d, I mean Athens. And not only one day, but all the days in an entire\n year, would be too short for a man who should attempt to enumerate all the cities\n which might be enumerated as discernible in that uranopolis of the Romans, the\n city of Rome; so numerous are they.\u2014For indeed some entire nations are settled\n there, as the Cappadocians, the Scythians, the people of Pontus, and many others.\n And all these nations, being so to say the entire population of the world, called\n the dancer who was so famous in our time Memphis, comparing him, on account of the\n elegance of his movements, to the most royal and honourable of cities; a city of\n which Bacchylides sings\u2014 \n Memphis, which winter dares not to assail, \n And lotus-crowned Nile. \n \n \n As for the Pythagorean philosophy, Athen\u00e6us explains that to us, and shows us\n everything in silence more intelligibly than others who undertake to teach the\n arts which require talking. \n ","36":"\n Now of tragic dancing, as it was called, such as it existed in his time, Bathyllus\n of Alexandria was the first introducer; whom Seleucus describes as having been a\n legitimate dancer. This Bathyllus, according to the account of Aristonicus, and\n Pylades too, who has written a treatise on dancing, composed the Italian dance\n from the comic one which was called \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, and\n from the tragic dance which was called \u1f10\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, \n and from the Satyric dance which was called \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2, (from which also the Satyrs were called \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af, ) the inventor of which was a barbarian\n named Sicinnus, though some say that Sicinnus was a Cretan. Now, the dance\n invented by Pylades was stately, pathetic, and laborious; but that of Bathyllus\n was in a merrier style; for he added to his a kind of ode to Apollo. But\n Sophocles, in addition to being eminent for personal beauty, was very accomplished\n in music and dancing, having been instructed in those arts while a boy by Lamprus,\n and after the naval victory of Salamis, he having no clothes on, but only being\n anointed with oil, danced round the trophy erected on that occasion to the music\n of the lyre, but some say that he had his tunic on; and when he exhibited his\n Thamyris he himself played the harp; and he also played at \n ball with great skill when he exhibited his Nausicaa. And Socrates the Wise was\n very fond of the dance Memphis; and as he was often caught dancing, as Xenophon\n relates, he said to his friends that dancing was a gymnastic exercise for every\n limb; for the ancients used the word \u1f40\u03c1\u03c7\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for\n every sort of motion and agitation. Anacreon says\u2014 \n The fair-hair'd maids of mighty Jove \n Danced lightly in the mystic grove; \n and Ion has the expression\u2014 \n This strange occurrence makes my heart to dance. \n \n \n ","37":"\n And Hermippus says, that Theophrastus used to come to the walks at a regular hour,\n carefully and beautifully dressed; and that then he would sit down and enter upon\n an argument, indulging in every sort of motion and gesture imaginable; so that\n once while imitating an epicure he even put out his tongue and licked his\n lips. \n Those men were very careful to put on their clothes neatly; and they ridiculed\n those who did not do so. Plato, in the The\u00e6tetus, speaks of a man who has\n capacity to manage everything cleverly and perfectly, but who has no idea how\n to put on even proper clothes like a gentleman, and who has no notion of the\n propriety of language, so as to be able to celebrate the life of gods and men\n in a becoming manner. And Sappho jests upon Andromeda:\u2014 \n Sure by some milkmaid you've been taught \n To dress, whose gown is all too short \n To reach her sturdy ancles. \n And Philet\u00e6rus says\u2014 \n Don't let your gown fall down too low, \n Nor pull it up too high to show \n Your legs in clownish fashion. \n And Hermippus says, that Theocritus of Chios used to blame the way in\n which Anaximenes used to wrap his cloak round him as a boorish style of dressing.\n And Callistratus the pupil of Aristophanes, in one of his writings, attacked\n Aristarchus severely for not being neatly dressed, on the ground, that attention\n to those minute is no trifling indication of a man's abilities and good sense. On\n which account Alexis says\u2014 \n 'Tis a sure sign of a degraded nature, \n To walk along the street in sloven's guise; \n Having the means of neatness: which costs nothing; \n \n Is subject to no tax; requires no change; \n And creditable is to him who uses it, \n And pleasant to all those who witness it. \n Who then would ever disregard this rule, \n That wishes to be thought a man of sense? \n \n \n ","38":"\n But Aeschylus was not only the inventor of becoming and dignified dress, which the\n hierophants and torch-bearers of the sacred festivals imitated; but he also\n invented many figures in dancing, and taught them to the dancers of the chorus.\n And Cham\u00e6leon states that he first arranged the choruses; not using the ordinary\n dancing-masters, but himself arranging the figures of the dancers for the chorus;\n and altogether that he took the whole arrangement of his tragedies on himself. And\n he himself acted in his own plays very fairly. And accord- ingly, Aristophanes\n (and we may well trust the comic writers in what they say of the tragedians)\n represents Aeschylus himself as saying\u2014 \n I myself taught those dances to the chorus, \n Which pleased so much when erst they danced before us. \n And again, he says, I recollect that when I saw ' The Phrygians,'\n when the men came on who were uniting with Priam in his petition for the ransom\n of his son, some danced in this way, some in that, all at random. \n Telesis, or Telestes, (whichever was his right name,) the dancing-master, invented\n many figures, and taught men to use the action of their hands, so as to give\n expression to what they said. Phillis the Delian, a musician, says, that the\n ancient harp-players moved their countenances but little, but their feet very\n much, imitating the march of troops or the dancing of a chorus. Accordingly\n Aristotle says, that Telestes the director of Aeschylus's choruses was so great a\n master of his art, that in managing the choruses of the Seven Generals against\n Thebes, he made all the transactions plain by dancing. They say, too, that the old\n poets, Thespis, Pratinas, Carcinus, and Phrynichus, were called dancing poets,\n because they not only made their dramas depend upon the dancing of the chorus, but\n because, besides directing the exhibition of their own plays, they also taught\n dancing to all who wished to learn. But Aeschylus was often drunk when he wrote\n his tragedies, if we may trust Cham\u00e6leon: and accordingly Sophocles reproached\n him, saying, that even when he did what was right he did not know that he was ding\n so. \n \n ","39":"\n Now the national dances are the following:\u2014the Lace- d\u00e6monian, the Tr\u0153zenian, the\n Epizephyrian, the Cretan, the Ionian, the Mantinean, which Aristoxenus considers\n as the best of all, on account of its movement of the hands. And dancing was\n considered so creditable an employment, and one requiring so much talent, that\n Pindar calls Apollo a dancer:\u2014 \n Prince of dancers, prince of grace, \n Hail, Ph\u0153bus of the silver quiver. \n And Homer too, or one of the Homerid\u00e6, in one of the hymns to Apollo,\n says\u2014 \n How deftly Ph\u0153bus strikes the golden lyre, \n While strength and grace each moving limb inspire! \n and Eumelus, or Arctinus, the Corinthian, somewhere or other introduces\n Jupiter himself as dancing, saying\u2014 \n And gracefully amid the dancing throng, \n The sire of gods and mortals moved along. \n But Theophrastus says that Andron of Catana, a flute-player, was the\n first person who invented motions of the body keeping time to music, while he\n played on the flute to the dancers; from whom dancing among the ancients was\n called Sicelizing. And that he was followed by Cleophantus of Thebes. Among the\n dancers of reputation there was Bulbus, mentioned by Cratinus and Callias; and\n Zeno the Cretan, who was in high favour with Artaxerxes, mentioned by Ctesias.\n Alexander also, in his letter to Philoxenus, mentions Theodorus and\n Chrysippus. \n ","40":"\n The Temple of the Muses is called by Timon the Phliasian, the satiric writer, the\n basket, by which term he means to ridicule the philosophers who frequent it, as if\n they were fattened up in a hen-coop, like valuable birds:\u2014 \n Aegypt has its mad recluses, \n Book-bewilder'd anchorites, \n In the hen-coop of the Muses \n Keeping up their endless fights. \n . . . . till these table orators got cured of their diarrhea of words; a\n pack of men, who from their itch for talking appear to me to have forgotten the\n Pythian oracle, which Chameleon quotes\u2014 \n Three weeks ere Sirius burns up the wheat, \n And three weeks after, seek the cool retreat \n Of shady house, and better your condition \n By taking Bacchus for your sole physician. \n \n And so Mnesitheus the Athenian says that the Pythia enjoined\n the Athenians to honour Bacchus the physician. But Alc\u00e6us, the Mitylen\u00e6an poet,\n says\u2014 \n Steep your heart in rosy wine, for see, the dog star is in view; \n Lest by heat and thirst oppress'd you should the season's fury rue. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Fill me, boy, a sparkling cup; \n See, the dogstar's coming up. \n And Eupolis says that Callias was compelled to drink by Protagoras, in\n order that his lungs might not be melted away before the dogdays. But at such a\n time I not only feel my lungs dried up, but I may almost say my heart too. And\n Antiphanes says\u2014 \n \n A. Tell me, I pray you, how you life define. \n \n B. To drink full goblets of rich Chian wine. \n You see how tall and fine the forest grows \n Through which a sacred river ceaseless flows; \n While on dry soils the stately beech and oak \n Die without waiting for the woodman's stroke. \n And so, says he, they, disputing about the dogstar, had plenty to drink.\n Thus the word \u03b2\u03c1\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9, to moisten or soak, is often\n applied to drinking. And so Antiphanes says\u2014 \n Eating much may bring on choking, \n Unless you take a turn at soaking. \n And Eubulus has\u2014 \n \n A. I Sicon come with duly moisten'd clay. \n \n B. What have you drunk then? A.

Thucydides says in his first book, When they are defeated\n they are least of all people inclined to \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. \n And Cratinus uses the same expression of rowers\u2014 \n Ply your oars and bend your backs. \n And Xenophon in his \u0152conomics says, Why is it that rowers are not\n troublesome to one another, except because they sit in regular order, and bend\n forward in r gular order, and ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd )\n lean back in regular order? \u2014The word \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 is properly applied to a statue, on which account they\n used to laugh at those who used the word of the guests at a feast, for whom the\n proper expression was \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9. \n Accordingly Diphilus puts into the mouth of a man at a feast\u2014\n \n I for a while sat down ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd ): \n and his friend, not approving of such an expression, says, \u02bc\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf. And Philippides has\u2014 \n I supped too \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 in his house. \n And then the other speaker rejoins\u2014 \n What, was he giving a dinner to a statue? \n But the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 is used, and\n also \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03bb\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, of reclining at meals: as\n Xenophon and Plato prove in their essays called the Banquet. Alexis too says\u2014\n \n 'Tis hard before one's supper to lie down, \n For if one does one cannot go to sleep; \n Nor give much heed to aught that may be said; \n One's thoughts being fix'd on what there 'll be to eat. \n Not but what the word \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 is used\n in this sense, though rarely. The satyr in Sophocles says\u2014 \n If I catch fire I'll leap with a mighty \n Spring upon Hercules, as \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n And Aristotle says, when speaking of the laws of the Tyrrhenians,\n But the Tyrrhenians sup, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \n with the women under the same covering. Theopompus also says\u2014 \n Then we the goblets fill'd with mighty wine, \n On delicate couches \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \n \n Singing in turn old songs of Telamon. \n And Philonides says\u2014 \n I have been here \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 a long\n time. \n And Euripides says in the Cyclops\u2014 \n \n \u02bc\u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 (which is the same as \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf \n \n Breathing forth long and deep and heavy breath. \n p And Alexis says\u2014 \n After that I bade her \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd by my\n side. \n \n \n ","42":"\n The ancients, too, used the word \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 for to\n taste. And so Ph\u0153nix says to Achilles, \"You would not \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 anything in any one else's house.

And\n Priam says to Achilles\u2014- \n Now I have tasted food, ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd. ) \n For it was natural for a man suffering under such calamities as his, only\n just to taste food, for his grief would not permit him to go so far as to satisfy\n his hunger. And therefore, he who did not touch food at all is called\n fasting, \n \u1f04\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. But the poet never uses the word \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 of those who eat their fill; but in their case\n he uses words which express satiety:\u2014 \n But when their minds were pleased ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c6\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd )\n with wholesome food; \n and, \n When they had ceased to wish for meat and drink. \n But more modern writers use the word \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 for being satisfied. Callimachus says\u2014 \n I should like to satiate \n ( \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) myself with thyme; \n and Eratosthenes\u2014 \n They roasted their game in the ashes and ate it, \n ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf ) at least they all did who could\n get it. \n \n \n ","43":"\n We find in the Theban bard the expression, glueing them together as one\n would glue one piece of wood to another. \n \n Seleucus says that the expression so common in Homer, \u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\n \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd, is the same as \u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1 by a\n slight alteration of the arrangement of the letters; for he thinks that is too\n violent a change to consider it as derived from \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n Carystius of Pergamos relates that the Corcyrean women sing to this day when\n playing at ball. And in Homer, it is not only men who play, but women also. And\n they used to play at quoits also, and at throwing the javelin, with some grace:\u2014\n \n They threw the quoit, and hurl'd the playful spear. \n For any amusement takes away the feeling of ennui. And young men\n prosecute hunting as a sort of practice against the dangers of war; and there is\n no sort of chase which they avoid; and the consequence is that they are more\n vigorous and healthy than they otherwise would be. \n As when they stand firm as unshaken towers, \n And face the foe, and pour forth darts in showers. \n \n The men of those times were acquainted with baths also of all\n sorts. as a relief from fatigue. Refreshing themselves after toil by bathing in\n the sea; which of all baths is the best for the sinews; and having relaxed the\n excessive strains of their muscles in the bath, they then anointed themselves with\n ointment, in order to prevent their bodies from becoming too rigid as the water\n evaporated. And so the men who returned from a reconnoissance, \n Wash'd off their heat in Neptune's briny tides, \n And bathed their heads, and legs, and brawny sides. \n \n And then\u2014 \n They to the polish'd marble baths repair, \n Anoint with fresh perfumes their flowing hair, \n And seek the banquet hall. \n There was another way, too, of refreshing themselves and getting rid of\n their fatigue, by pouring water over the head:\u2014 \n Then o'er their heads and necks the cooling stream \n The handmaids pour'd: \n \n for baths, in which the whole body is immersed, as the water surrounds\n all the pores on every side, prevents the escape of the perspiration, just as if a\n sieve were thrown into the water. For then nothing goes through the sieve, unless\n you lift it up out of the water, and so allow its pores, if one may call them so,\n to open, and make a passage through; as Aristotle says in his problems of natural\n philosophy, when he asks, Why do men in a perspiration, when they come into\n warm or cold water no longer perspire, until they leave the bath again? \n \n ","44":"\n Vegetables also were set before the ancient heroes when they supped. And that they\n were acquainted with the use of vegetables is plain from the expression, \n He went down to the furthest bed \n In the well-order'd garden. \n And they used onions too, though they have a very disagreeable smell:\u2014\n \n There was the onion, too, to season wine. \n \n \n Homer represents his heroes also as fond of the fruit of trees:\u2014 \n Figs after figs grow old, pears after pears. \n \n On which account also he calls those trees which bear fruit\n beauteous:\u2014 \n There many a beauteous tree appears\u2014 \n Pomegranates, apples, figs, and pears. \n And those which are adapted for being cut down for timber he calls tall,\n distinguishing the epithets which h applies to each by their respective uses:\u2014\n \n There tall trees adorn the grove, \n The ash, and pine that towers above. \n And the use of these trees was older than the Trojan war. And Tantalus,\n even after he is dead, is not cured of his fancy for these fruits; as the god, to\n punish him, waves such before his eyes (just as men lead on irrational animals by\n holding branches in front of them), and then prevents him from enjoying them, the\n moment he begins to entertain a hope of doing so. And Ulysses reminds Laertes of\n what he gave him when he was a child: You gave me thirteen pears \n \u2014and so on. \n ","45":"\n And that they used to eat fish, Sarpedon proves plainly, when he compares the\n being taken prisoner to fish caught in a large net. Yet Eubulus, jesting in the\n way that the comic writers allow themselves, says\u2014 \n I pray you, where in Homer is the chief \n Who e'er eat fish, or anything but beef? \n And, though so much of liberty they boasted, \n Their meat was never anything but roasted. \n Nor did those heroes allow the birds the free enjoyment of the air;\n setting traps and nets for thrushes and doves. And they practised the art of\n taking birds, and, suspending a dove by a small string to the mast of a ship, then\n shot arrows at it from a distance, as is shown in the book describing the funeral\n games. But Homer passed over the use of vegetables, and fish, and birds, lest to\n mention them should seem like praising gluttony, thinking besides there would be a\n want of decorum in dwelling on the preparation of such things, which he considered\n beneath the dignity of gods and heroes. But that they did in reality eat their\n meat boiled as well as roasted, he shows when he says\u2014 \n But as a caldron boils with melting fat \n Of well-fed pig; \n \n and the foot of the ox which was thrown at Ulysses proves it\n too, for no one ever roasts oxen's feet. And the line too- \n Then many a well-fill'd dish was duly set \n On the full board, with every kind of meat; \n as this not only speaks of the variety of meats, such as birds, pigs,\n kids, and beef; but it also speaks of the way in which they were dressed as having\n varied, and not having been all of one kind, but carefully arranged. So that you\n may see here the origin of the Sicilian and Sybaritic and Italian ways of giving\n feasts, and the Chian fashion also. For the Chians are reported not to have been\n less studious than the other nations just mentioned in the art of dressing their\n meat. Timocles says\u2014 \n The Chians \n Are splendid hands at dressing viands. \n And in Homer, not only the young men, but the old men too, such as Ph\u0153nix\n and Nestor, sleep with the women; and Menelaus is the only man who has no woman\n allotted to him, inasmuch as he had collected the whole expedition for the sake of\n his wife, who had been carried away from him. \n ","46":"\n Pindar praises \n Ancient wine and modern songs. \n And Eubulus says\u2014 \n Inconsistent it seems for a fair one to praise \n Old wine, and to say that such never can cloy; \n But bring her a man who has seen his best days, \n And she'd rather put up with a whiskerless boy. \n And Alexis says very nearly the same thing word for word; only using the\n word little instead of never. \n Though in reality old wine is not only more pleasant, but also better for health;\n for it aids digestion more; and being thinner it is itself more digestible; it\n also invigorates the body; and makes the blood red and fluid, and produces\n untroubled sleep. But Homer praises that wine most which will admit of a copious\n admixture of water; as the Maronean. And old wine will allow of more water being\n added to it, because its very age has added heat to it. And some men say, that the\n flight of Bacchus to the sea is emblematic of the making of wine, as it was\n practised long ago; because wine is very sweet when sea-water\n is poured into it. And Homer praising dark-coloured wine, often calls it \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03bf\u03c8. For the dark-coloured wine is the strongest, and\n it remains in the system of the drinkers of it longer than any other. But\n Theopompus says, that black wine was first made among the Chians; and, that the\n Chians were the first people who imparted the knowledge of planting and tending\n vines to the rest of mankind, having learnt it from \u0152nopion the son of Bacchus,\n who was the original colonizer of their island. But white wine is weak and thin;\n but yellow wine is very digestible, being of a more drying nature. \n ","47":"\n Respecting the Italian wines, Galen is represented by this sophist as saying, that\n the Falernian wine is fit to drink from the time that it is ten or fifteen years\n old, till it is twenty; but after that time it falls off, and is apt to give\n headaches, and affects the nervous system. There are two kinds of Falernian wine,\n the dry and the sweet. The sweet wine is made when the south wind blows through\n the vineyard; which also makes it darker in colour. But that which is not made at\n this time is dry and yellow. Of the Alban wine there are also two kinds, one sweet\n and one sour; and both are in their prime after they are fifteen years old. The\n wine of Surrentum begins to be drinkable when five-and-twenty years old; for as it\n has no oil of any sort in it, and is very thin, it is a long time ripening: and\n when it is old it is nearly the only wine that is wholesome to be drunk for a\n continuance. But the Rhegian wine, being richer than the Surrentine, may be used\n as soon as it is fifteen years old. The wine of Privernum too is very good, being\n thinner than the Rhegian wine, and one which does not take much effect on the\n head. And the Formian wine is like it; and is a wine which soon comes to its\n prime; it is, however, a richer wine than the other, But the Trifoline wine is\n slower ripening, and has a more earthy taste than the Surrentine. The Setine is a\n wine of the first class, like the Falernian wine, but lighter, and not so apt to\n make \"a man drunk. The wine of Tibur is thin, and evaporates easily, being at its\n best as soon as it is ten years old. Still it is better as it gets older. The\n Labican wine is sweet and oily to the taste, being something between the Falerrian\n and the Alban: and you may drink that when it is ten years old. There is the\n Gauran wine too, a scarce and very fine wine, and likewise\n very powerful and oily; more so indeed than the wine of Pr\u00e6neste or of Tibur. The\n Marsic is a very dry wine; and very good for the stomach. Around Cum\u00e6 in Campania\n there is a wine made which is called Ulban, a light wine, fit to be drunk when\n five years old. The wine of Ancona is a fine wine, and rather oily. The Buxentine\n is like the Alban, as far as being rather sour; but it is a strong wine, and good\n for the stomach. The Veliternian wine is very sweet to drink and good for the\n stomach; but it has this peculiarity, that it does not taste like a pure wine, but\n always has an appearance as if some other was mixed with it. The Calenian wine is\n light, and better for the stomach than the Falernian. The C\u00e6cuban is a noble wine,\n full of strength and easily affecting the head; but it does not come to its prime\n till after many years. The Fundan wine is strong, and nutritious, and affects the\n head and stomach, on which account it is not much used at banquets. But the Sabine\n wine is lighter than any of these, and is fit to be drunk from the time that it is\n seven years old till it is fifteen; and the Signine wine is available at six years\n old, but as it gets older it is far more valuable. The wine of Nomentum gets in\n season very early, and can be drunk as soon as it is five years old; it is not\n very sweet, and not very thin; but that of Spoletum is very sweet to the taste,\n and has a golden colour. The wine of Capua is in many respects like the Surrentine\n wine. The Barbine is very dry and continually improving. The Caucine too is a\n noble wine, and resembles the Falernian. The wine of Venafrum is good for the\n stomach, and light. The Trebellian wine, which is made round Naples, is of\n moderate strength, good for the stomach, and pleasant to the taste. The Erbulian\n wine is at first dark coloured, but in a few years it becomes white; and it is a\n very light and delicate wine. That of Marseilles is a fine wine, but it is scarce,\n and thick, with a good deal of body. The Tarentine, and all the other wines of\n that district, are delicate wines, without very much strength or body, sweet, and\n good for the stomach. The Mamertine is a foreign wine, made out of Italy. There is\n also another wine made in Sicily, and called Iotaline; it is a sweet wine and\n light, but there is some strength in it. \n Among the Indians a deity is worshipped, according to the \n account of Chares of Mitylene, who is called Soroadeus; which name, as interpreted\n in Greek, means Winemaker. \n ","48":"\n Antiphanes, that witty man, catalogues all the things which are peculiar to each\n city thus:\u2014 \n Cooks come from Elis, pots from Argos, \n Corinth blankets sends in barges, \n Phlius wine, and Sicyon fish, \n While cheese is a Sicilian dish. \n Aegium sends flute-playing maids; \n Perfumers ply their dainty trades \n At Athens, under Pallas' eye; \n B\u0153otia sends us eels to fry. \n And Hermippus says, \n Tell me, ye Muses, who th' Olympic height \n Cheer with your holy songs and presence bright; \n Tell me what blessings Bacchus gave to man, \n Since first his vessel o'er the waters ran. \n Ox-hides from Libya's coasts, and juicy kail: \n The narrow sea, still vocal with the wail \n Of lost Leander's bride, the tunny sends, \n And our first meal with kipper'd salmon mends. \n Groats come from Italy, and ribs of beef; \n While Thrace sends many a lie and many a thief. \n Still do the Spartans scratch their sides in vain, \n Mad with the itching of th' Odrysian pain. \n Then Syracuse gives cheese and well-fed pigs; \n Fair Athens olives sends, and luscious figs. \n Cursed of all islands let Corcyra be, \n Where no especial excellence we see. \n Sails come from Egypt, and this paper too; \n Incense from Syria; Crete upholds to view \n The cypress tall; and, dear to mighty Jove, \n In Paphlagonia grows the almond grove. \n The elephant sends its teeth from Afric's sands; \n Pears and fat sheep grow on Eub\u0153a's lands; \n Rhodes sends us raisins, and beguiles the night \n With figs that make our dreams and slumbers light \n From Phrygia slaves, allies from Area's land; \n The Pagas$ean ports their hirelings brand; \n Ph\u0153nicia sends us dates across the billows, \n ???nd Carthage, carpets rich, and well-stuft'd pillows. \n \n \n ","49":"\n Pindar too, in the Pythian ode addressed to Hiero, says, \n Give me the noble Spartan hound \n With whose deep voice Eurotas' banks resound; \n While the dark rocks \n Of Scyrus give the choicest flocks \n \n Of milky goats; and, prompt at war's alarms, \n Brave Argos burnishes the well-proved arms, \n The Sicels build the rapid car, \n And the fierce Thebans urge the chariot to the war. \n \n Critias tells us\u2014 \n Know ye the land of the fair Proserpine, \n Where the cottabus splashes the ominous wine; \n Where the lightest and handsomest cars . . . \n \n \n And what can for tired limbs compare \n With the soft and yielding Thessalian chair? \n But no town with Miletus vies \n In the bridal bed's rich canopies. \n But none the golden bowl can chase, \n Or give to brass such varied grace, \n As that renowned hardy race \n That dwells by Arno's tide; \n Ph\u0153nicia, mother of the arts, \n Letters to learned men imparts; \n Thebes scaled the mountain's side, \n Bade the tough ash its trunk to yield, \n And fill'd with cars the battle-field; \n While Carians, masters of the seas, \n First launch'd the boat to woo the breeze. \n Offspring of clay and furnace bright, \n The choicest porcelain clear and light \n Boasts, as its birth-place, of the towers \n Which Neptune's and Minerva's powers \n From ills and dangers shield; \n Which beat back war's barbaric wave \n When Mede and Persian found a grave \n In Marathon's undying field. \n And indeed the pottery of Attica is deservedly praised.

And Alexis says\u2014 \n All wise men think \n The Lesbian is the nicest wine to drink. \n And again he says\u2014 \n His whole thoughts every day incline \n To drink what rich and rosy wine \n From Thasos and from Lesbos comes, \n And dainty cakes and sugarplums. \n And again\u2014 \n Hail, O Bacchus, ever dear, \n You who from Lesbos drove dull care \n With sparkling rosy wine; \n He who would give one glass away, \n Too vile on cheerful earth to stay, \n Shall be no friend of mine. \n And Ephippus sings\u2014 \n Oh how luscious, oh how fine \n Is the Pramnian Lesbian wine! \n All who 're brave, and all who're wise, \n Much the wine of Lesbos prize. \n And Antiphanes\u2014 \n There is good meat, and plenteous dainty cheer; \n And Thasian wine, perfumes, and garlands here; \n Venus loves comfort; but where folks are poor, \n The merry goddess ever shuns their door. \n And Eubulus\u2014 \n In Thasian wine or Chian soak your throttle, \n Or take of Lesbian an old cobwebb'd bottle. \n He speaks too of Psithian wine\u2014 \n Give me some Psithian nectar, rich and neat, \n To cool my thirst, and quench the burning heat. \n And Anaxandrides mentions a jar full of Psithian wine. \n \n \n ","51":"\n Thesmophorius of Tr\u0153zene entitles the second \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 of Aristophanes \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9. . In that play the poet speaks of Peparethian wine:\u2014\n \n Shun, my boy, the Pramnian cup, \n Nor Thasian drink, nor Chian sup; \n Nor let your glass with Peparethian brighten\u2014 \n For bachelors that liquor's too exciting. \n Elbulus says\u2014 \n As sweet as \n Wine from Leucas or Miletus. \n Archestratus, the author of The Art of giving a Banquet, \n says,\u2014 \n \n When a libation to the gods you make, \n Let your wine worthy be, and ripe and old; \n Whose hoary locks droop o'er his purple lake, \n Such as in Lesbos' sea-girt isle is sold. \n Ph\u0153nicia doth a generous liquor bear, \n But still the Lesbian I would rather quaff; \n For though through age the former rich appear, \n You'll find its fragrance will with use go off. \n \n \n But Lesbian is the true ambrosial juice, \n And so the gods, whose home's Olympus, think it; \n And if some rather the Phoenician choose, \n Let them, as long as they don't make you drink it. \n \n \n The Thasian isle, too, noble wine doth grow, \n When passing years have made its flavour mellow, \n And other places too; still all I know \n Is that the Lesbian liquor has no fellow. \n \n \n I need not stop to tell you all the names \n Of towns which in the generous contest vie, \n Each for itself the vict'ry hotly claims; \n But still the Lesbian wine beats all, say I. \n \n \n \n ","52":"\n Ephippus, too, mentions the Phoenician wine, saying, Nuts, pomegranates,\n dates, and other sweetmeats, and small casks of Ph\u0153nician wine. And\n again,\u2014 \n A cask of good Ph\u0153nician wine was tapp'd. \n Xenophon, too, mentions it in his Anabasis. The Mend\u00e6an wine is mentioned\n by Cratinus:\u2014 \n When a man tastes Mend\u00e6an wine, \n How rich, says he, how sweet, how fine! \n I wonder where it can be bought, or \n What's the right quantity of water. \n And Hermippus somewhere introduces Bacchus as mentioning several\n different kinds of wine:\u2014 \n \n Mend\u00e6an wine such as the gods distil, \n And sweet Magnesian, cures for every ill, \n And Thasian, redolent of mild perfume; \n But of them all the most inviting bloom \n Mantles above old Homer's Chian glass; \n That wine doth all its rivals far surpass. \n There is a wine, which Saprian they call, \n Soon as the seals from whose rich hogshead fall, \n Violets and roses mix their lovely scent, \n And hyacinths, in one rich fragrance blent; \n You might believe Jove's nectar sparkled there, \n With such ambrosial odour reeks the air. \n This is the wine I'll to my friends disclose; \n The Peparethian trash may suit my foes. \n And Phanias the Eresian poet says that the Mend\u00e6ans are in the habit of\n syringing the grapes with opening medicine, even while still on the vine; and that\n this makes the wine soft. \n ","53":"\n Themistocles received from the king of Persia Lampsacus, to supply him with wine;\n Magnesia, for bread; Myus, for meat; and Percope and Pal\u00e6scepsis were to provide\n him with bedclothes and garments. The king moreover enjoined him to wear a cloak\n such as is worn by the barbarians, as he had previously bade Demaratus do; and he\n gave him the same presents as he had formerly given to Demaratus, and added also a\n robe such as is worn by the sons-in-law of the king, on condition of his never\n reassuming the Greek attire. And Cyrus the Great gave Pytharchus of Cyzicus, being\n a friend of his, seven cities, as is related by Agathocles of Babylon; namely,\n Pedasus, and Olympius, and Cama, and Tium, and Sceptra, and Artypsus, and Tortyra.\n But he, being made insolent and having his head turned by this liberality,\n attempted to make himself tyrant of his country, and collected an army for that\n purpose. On which the people of Cyzicus went out to battle against him, and\n attacked him eagerly, and so preserved their liberties. \n Among the people of Lampsacus Priapus is held in high honour, being the same as\n Bacchus, and having this name Priapus only as an epithet, just as Thriambus and\n Dithyrambus are. \n The Mitylen\u00e6ans have a sweet wine which they call \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, and others call it \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n ","54":"\n The Icarian wine, too, is held in high estimation, as Amphis says:\u2014 \n \n Thurium gives the olive juice, \n Lentils Gela's fields produce; \n Icarian wine well merits praise, \n And figs which the Cimolians raise. \n The Pramnian wine, too, according to Eparchides, is produced in Icarus.\n It is a peculiar kind of wine; and it is neither sweet nor thick, but dry and\n hard, and of extraordinary strength; and Aristophanes says that the Athenians did\n not like it, for that the Athenian people did not like hard and sour poets,\n nor hard Pramnian wines, which contract the eyebrows and the stomach; but they\n prefer a fragrant wine, ripe, and flavoured like nectar. For Semus says\n that there is in Icarus a rock called the Pramnian rock; and near it is a great\n mountain, from which the Pramnian wine has its name, and some call it a medicinal\n wine. Now Icarus used formerly to be called the Fishy Icarus, from the number of\n fish around it; just as the Echinades had their name from the sea-urchins, and the\n promontory Sepias from the number of cuttle-fish which are taken near it. And in\n like manner the Laguss\u00e6 islands are so called from \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03c2, a hare, as being full of hares. And other islands are called\n Phycuss\u00e6, and Lopaduss\u00e6, for similar reasons. And according to Eparchides, the\n vine which produces the Icarian Pramnian wine, is called by the strangers the Holy\n vine, and by the people of \u0152noe the Dionysiac vine. And \u0152noe is a city in the\n island. \n But Didymus says that the Pramnian wine comes from a vine called Pramnian; and\n some say that the name means merely dark-coloured. But others affirm that it is a\n generic name for wine suitable for long keeping, as being \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, that is to say, such as can be\n kept. And some say that it is so called from \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b0\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \n mollifying anger, because those who drink it become\n good-humoured. \n ","55":"\n Amphis praises also the wine which comes from the city of Acanthus, saying,\u2014\n \n \n A. Whence do you come, friend? speak. \n \n B. From Acanthus I. \n \n A. Acanthus? then I trow, \n Since you're a countryman of wine so strong, \n You must be fierce yourself; \n Your country's name is thorny, but\n I hope \n Your manners are not quite so rough and prickly. \n \n And Alexis mentions Corinthian wine as a harsh wine\u2014 \n And foreign wine was there; for that from Corinth \n Is painful drinking. \n He speaks, too, of wine from Eub\u0153a\u2014 \n Drinking deep draughts of harsh Eub\u0153an wine. \n The Naxian wine is compared by Archilochus to nectar. And he says in some\n one of his poems\u2014 \n My spear finds corn, my spear finds wine, \n From Ismarus; on my spear I dine, \n And on it, when fatigued, recline. \n But Strattis praises the wine of Sciathus\u2014 \n The black Sciathian wine mix'd half and half, \n Invites the traveller to halt and quaff. \n And Ach\u00e6us praises the Bibline wine\u2014 \n He pledged him in a cup of Bibline wine. \n While it has its name from some district which is called by a similar\n appellation. And Philyllius says,\u2014 \n I'll give you Lesbian, Chian wine, \n Thasian, Mend\u00e6an, and Bibline; \n Sweet wines, but none so strong and heady \n As that you shall next day feel seedy. \n \n \n But Epicharmus says that it is named from some mountains of a similar name. And\n Armenidas says that there is a district of Thrace called the Biblian, the same\n which was afterwards called Tisara, and \u0152syma. And it was very natural for Thrace\n to be admired as a country producing fine wines; and indeed all the adjacent\n country deserves the same character. \n Full of rich wine the ships from Lemnos came. \n But Hippias the Rhegian says that the wine called the \n creeper was also called Biblian; and that Pollis the\n Argive, who was king of Syracuse, was the first person who brought it to Syracuse\n from Italy. And if that be true, probably the sweet wine which among the Sicilians\n is called Pollian, is the same as the Bibline wine. There is an ancient oracle:\u2014\n \n Drink wine where lees abound, since Fate has not \n Placed you amid Anthedon's flowery plains, \n Or in the streets of sacred Hypera, \n Where purer wine abounds. \n \n And there was a vine among the people of Tr\u0153zene, (as Aris-\n totle says, in his book on their polity,) called Anthedonian, and another called\n Hyperian; from men of the name of Anthus and Hyperus, just as the Althephian vine\n is named after a man of the name of Althephias, one of the descendants of\n Alpheus. \n ","56":"\n Aleman somewhere speaks of a wine as free from fire, and smelling of flowers,\n which is produced from the Five Hills, a place about seven furlongs from Sparta.\n And he mentions another wine which comes from Denthiades, a small fortress, and\n another from \u0152nus, and another from Onogle and Stathmi. And these places are all\n near Pitane. Accordingly, he says, And wine from \u0152nus, or from Denthis, or\n from Carystus, or from Onogl\u00e6, or from Stathmi. The Carystian wine is\n that which comes from Carystus in Laconia, on the borders of Arcadia. And he calls\n it free from fire as not having been boiled; for they often used\n boiled wines. Polybius says that there was an admirable wine made at Capua; which\n was called \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, to which no other wine\n was at all comparable. But Alciphron of the M\u00e6ander says, that there was a\n mountain village near the Ephesian territories, which was formerly called\n Latona's, but is now called Latorea, from Latorea the Amazon; and that there also\n Pramnian wine is made. Timachidas the Rhodian calls a wine made at Rhodes \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or the adulterated \n wine, being near akin to sweet wine. But that wine is\n called \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 which goes through no process of\n decoction. \n There is also a Rhodian wine, which Polyzelus calls \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\u00b7 \n and another which Plato the comic writer calls\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ; and this wine is made in the\n greatest perfection at Beneventum, a city in Italy. But the wine Amphis is spoken\n of as a very poor wine by Sosicrates. The ancients used also a certain wine made\n of spices, which they called \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1. But\n Theophrastus, in his History of Plants, says, that a wine is made in Her\u00e6a in\n Arcadia which, when it is drunk, drives men out of their senses, and makes women\n inclined to preg- nancy: and that around Cerunia in Achaia there is a kind of\n vine, from which a wine is made which has a tendency to cause abortion in pregnant\n women; and if they eat the grapes too, says he, they miscarry;\u2014and the Tr\u0153zenian\n wine, he says, makes those who drink it barren: and at Thasos, \n says he, they make a wine which produces sleep, and another which causes those who\n drink it to keep awake. \n ","57":"\n But concerning the manufacture of scented wine, Phanias of Eresus says,\n There is infused into the wine one portion of sea-water to fifty of\n wine, and that becomes scented wine. And again he says, Scented\n wine is made stronger of young than of old vines; and he subjoins,\n Having trodden on the unripe grapes they put the wine away, and it\n becomes scented. But Theophrastus says, that the wine at Thasos,\n which is given in the prytaneum, is wonderfully delicious; for it is well\n seasoned; for they knead up dough with honey, and put that into the earthen\n jars; so that the wine receives fragrance from itself, and sweetness from the\n honey. And he proceeds to say, If any one mixes harsh wine which\n has no smell with soft and fragrant wine, such, for instance, as the Heraclean\n wine with that of Erythr\u00e6, softness is derived from the one, and wholesomeness\n from the other. And the Myrtite or Myrrhine wine is spoken of by\n Posidippus:\u2014 \n A tasteless, dry, and foolish wine \n I consider the myrrhine. \n Hermes, too, is mentioned by Strattis as the name of a drink. And Ch\u00e6reas\n says, that a wine is made in Babylon which is called nectar. \n The bard of Ceos says\u2014 \n 'Tis not enough to mix your wine with taste, \n Unless sweet converse seasons the repast; \n And Bacchus' gifts well such regard deserve, \n That we should e'en the stones of grapes preserve. \n \n \n ","58":"\n Now of wines some are white, some yellow, and some red. The white is the thinnest\n in its nature, diuretic, and warm; and being a promoter of digestion it causes a\n heat in the head; for it is a wine which has a tendency to move upwards. But of\n red wine that which is not sweet is very nutritious, and is astringent; but that\n which is sweet (as is the case with even white and yellow wine also) is the most\n nutrition of all: for it softens all the ducts and passages, and thickens the\n fluid parts of the body, and does not at all confuse the head. For in reality the\n nature of sweet wine lingers about the ribs, and engenders spittle, as Diodes and\n Praxagoras asset. But Mnesitheus the Athenian says, Red wine is the mot\n nutritious; but white is the most diuretic and the thinnest; and the yellow is a dry wine, and that which most assists in the\n digestion of the food. \n \n Now the wines which have been very carefully prepared with sea-water never cause\n headaches; and they open the bowels, and sometimes gripe the stomach, and produce\n flatulency, and assist in the digestion of food. Of this character is the Myndian\n wine, and that of Halicarnassus. And so Menippus the Cynic calls Myndus\n brine-drinking. The Coan wine too has a good deal of sea-water\n in it. The Rhodian has not so much sea-water; but a great deal of that wine is\n good for nothing. Wine made in the islands is very good to drink, and not at all\n ill-calculated for daily use. But Cnidian wine makes blood, is nutritious, and\n keeps the bowels in a healthy state; though if it is drunk in great quantities it\n relaxes the stomach. The Lesbian wine is less astringent, and more diuretic. But\n the Chian is a nicer wine; and of all the Chian wine, that called the Aryusian is\n the best. And of this there are three varieties: for there is a dry kind, and a\n sweet kind; and that the flavour of which is between the two is called autocratic, that is, self-mixed. Now the dry kind is\n pleasant to the taste, nutritious, and more diuretic than the others; but the\n sweet kind is nutritious, filling, and apt to soften the bowels. The autocratic\n wine in its effects also is something between the two. But, generally speaking,\n the Chian wine is digestible, nutritious, a producer of good blood, mild, and\n filling, inasmuch as it has a great deal of body. But the nicest of all wines are\n the Alban and Falernian wines of Italy; but these, if they have been kept a length\n of time and are old, acquire a medicinal effect, and rapidly produce a sensation\n of heaviness. But the wine called Adrian relieves any oppression of the breath, is\n very digestible, and wholly free from all unpleasant consequences; but these wines\n require to be made with rapidity, and then to be set in an open place, so as to\n allow the thicker portions of their body to evaporate. But the best wine to keep a\n length of time is the Corcyrean. The Zacynthian and Leucadian wines also are apt\n to be bad for the head, because they contain chalk. There is a wine from Cilicia,\n called Abates, which has no effect except that of relaxing the bowels. But hard\n water, such as that from springs, or from rain if it is filtered, and has stood\n some time, agrees very well with Coan and Myndian and Halicarnassian wine, and indeed with every wine which has plenty of salt-water in\n it. And accordingly these wines are of the greatest use at Athens and Sicyon,\n because the waters in these cities are harsh. But for those wines which have no\n sea-water, and which are of a more astringent nature, especially for the Chian and\n Lesbian wine, the purest water is the most suitable. \n Oh thou my tongue, whom silence long hath bound, \n How wilt thou bear this tale of thine t' unfold? \n Hard is their fate to whom compulsion stern \n Leaves no alternative; which now compels thee \n To open what thy lord would fain conceal. \n These are the words of Sophocles. \n ","59":"\n The Mareotic wine, which comes from Alexandria, had its name from a fountain in\n the district of Alexandria called Marea; and from a town of the same name which\n was close to it; which was formerly a place of great importance, but is now\n reduced to a petty village. And the fountain and town derived their name from\n Maro, who was one of the companions of Bacchus in his expedition. And there are\n many vines in that country, which produce grapes very good to eat when raw, and\n the wine which is made from them is excellent. For it is white, and sweet, and\n good for the breath, and digestible, and then, it never produces any ill effect on\n the head, and is diuretic. And still better than this is the wine called T\u00e6niqtic.\n The word \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 means a riband; and there is in\n that district a long narrow riband of land, the wines produced from which are of a\n slightly green colour, with something oily in them, which is quickly dissolved\n when it is mixed with water; just as the Attic honey is dissolved by the same\n process. This T\u00e6niotic wine, in addition to being sweet, has something aromatic in\n it, of a slightly astringent character. But there are vines near the Nile in great\n quantities as far as the river extends; and there are many peculiarities in those\n vines, both a to their colour and as to their use. However, the best of all the\n wines made in that district is that made near the city of Antylla (which is not\n far from Alexandria), the revenues fro which the kings of those ages, both the\n Egyptian and Persian kings, used to give to their wives for pin-money. But the\n wine which is made in the Thebais, especially that near the city Coptos, is light,\n and easy of digestion, and also so great an assistant in the\n digestion of the rest of one's food, that it is given to people in fevers without\n injury. \n You praise yourself, as does Astydamas, woman! \n (Astydamas was a tragic poet.) \n ","60":"\n Theopompus the Chian says, that the vine is found at Olympia, near the Alpheus;\n and that there is a place about eight furlongs from Elis where the natives at the\n time of the Dionysian games close up three empty brazen vessels, and seal them in\n the presence of all the people round about; and at a subsequent time they open\n them and find them full of wine. But Hellanicus says, that the vine was first\n discovered in Plinthina, a city of Egypt; on which account Dion, the academic\n philosopher, calls the Egyptians fond of wine and fond of drinking: and also, that\n as subsidiary to wine, in the case of those who, on account of their poverty,\n could not get wine, there was introduced a custom of drinking beer made of barley;\n and moreover, that those who drank this beer were so pleased with it that they\n sung and danced, and did everything like men drunk with wine. Now Aristotle says,\n that men who are drunk with wine show it in their faces; but that those who have\n drunk too much beer fall back and go to sleep; for wine is stimulating, but beer\n has a tendency to stupefy. \n ","61":"\n Now that the Egyptians really are fond of wine this is a proof, that they are the\n only people among whom it is a custom at their feasts to eat boiled cabbages\n before all the rest of their food; and even to this very time they do so. And many\n people add cabbage seed to potions which they prepare as preventives against\n drunkenness. And wherever a vineyard has cabbages growing in it, there the wine is\n weaker. On which account the citizens of Sybaris also, as Timmeus says, used to\n eat cabbages before drinking. And so Alexis says\u2014 \n Last evening you were drinking deep, \n So now your head aches. Go to sleep; \n Take some boil'd cabbage when you wake; \n And there's an end of your headache. \n And Eubulus says, somewhere or other\u2014 \n Wife, quick! some cabbage boil, of virtues healing, \n That I may rid me of this seedy feeling. \n \n For the ancients used to call cabbage \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. And so Apollodorus of Carystus expressly says\u2014 \n We call it \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, and strangers \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7 ; \n But sure to women they must both the same be. \n And Anaxandrides says\u2014 \n If you butter and cabbage eat, \n All distempers you will beat, \n Driving off all headaches horrid, \n And clouds which hover round your forehead. \n And Nicochares says\u2014 \n Instead of cabbage, acorns boil to-morrow, \n Which equally rid you of all your sorrow. \n And Amphis tells us\u2014 \n When one's been drunk, the best relief I know \n Is stern misfortune's unexpected blow; \n For that at once all languor will dispel, \n As sure as cabbage. \n And Theophrastus also speaks of the effect which the cabbage produces,\n saying that the vine as long as it lives always turns away from the smell of\n cabbage. \n "},"1":{"0":"\n THE conversation which you reported to me did not allow me to give up a\n considerable portion of the day to sleep, as it was of a very varied nature. \n Nicander of Colophon says that wine, \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, has\n its name from \u0152neus:\u2014 \n \u0152neus pour'd the juice divine \n In hollow cups, and called it wine. \n And Melanippides of Melos says\u2014 \n 'Twas \u0152neus, master, gave his name to wine. \n But Hecat\u00e6us of Miletus says, that the vine was discovered In Aetolia;\n and adds, Orestheus, the son of Deucalion, came to Aetolia to endeavour to\n obtain the kingdom; and while he was there, a bitch which he had brought forth\n a stalk: and he ordered it to be buried in the ground, and from it there sprang up a vine loaded with grapes. On which account\n he called his son Phytius. And he had a son named \u0152neus, who was so called from\n the vines: for the ancient Greeks, says he, called vines\n \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. Now \u0152neus was the father of\n Aetolus. But Plato in his Cratylus, inquiring into the etymology of the\n word \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, says, that it is equivalent to\n \u03bf\u1f30\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, as filling the mind, \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, , with \u03bf\u1f34\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, or\n self-conceit. Perhaps, however, the word may be derived from \u1f44\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, succour. For Homer, giving as it were the derivation of the\n word, speaks nearly after this fashion\u2014 \n And then you will be succour'd ( \u1f40\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03b9 ) if\n you drink. \n And he too constantly calls food \u1f40\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \n because it supports us. \n ","1":"\n Now the author of the Cyprian poems, whoever he was, says\u2014 \n No better remedies than wine there are, \n O king, to drive away soul-eating care. \n And Diphilus the comic poet says\u2014 \n O Bacchus, to all wise men dear, \n How very kind you do appear; \n You make the lowly-hearted proud, \n And bid the gloomy laugh aloud; \n You fill the feeble man with daring, \n And cowards strut and bray past bearing. \n And Philoxenus of Cythera says\u2014 \n Good store of wine which makes men talk. \n But Ch\u00e6remon the tragedian says, that wine inspires those who use it with\n \n Laughter and wisdom and prudence and learning. \n And Ion of Chios calls wine \n Youth of indomitable might, \n With head of bull; the loveliest wight \n Who ever rank'd as Love's esquire, \n Filling men with strength and fire. \n And Mensitheus says\u2014 \n Great was the blessing, when the gods did show \n Sweet wine to those who how to use it know; \n But where bad men its righteous use pervert, \n To such, I trow, it will be rather hurt. \n For to the first it nourishment supplies, \n Strengthens their bodies, and their minds makes wise; \n A wholesome physic 'tis when mix'd with potions, \n Heals wounds as well as plasters or cold lotions. \n \n Wine to our daily feasts brings cheerful laughter, \n When mix'd with proper quantities of water; \n Men saucy get if one-third wine they quaff; \n While downright madness flows from half-and-half; \n And neat wine mind and body too destroys; \n While moderation wise secures our joys. \n And well the oracle takes this position, \n That Bacchus is all people's best physician. \n \n \n ","2":"\n And Eubulus introduces Bacchus as saying\u2014 \n Let them three parts of wine all duly season \n With nine of water, who'd preserve their reason; \n The first gives health, the second sweet desires, \n The third tranquillity and sleep inspires. \n These are the wholesome draughts which wise men please, \n Who from the banquet home return in peace. \n From a fourth measure insolence proceeds; \n Uproar a fifth, a sixth wild licence breeds; \n A seventh brings black eyes and livid bruises, \n The eighth the constable next introduces; \n Black gall and hatred lurk the ninth beneath, \n The tenth is madness, arms, and fearful death; \n For too much wine pour'd in one little vessel, \n Trips up all those who seek with it to wrestle. \n And Epicharmus says\u2014 \n \n A. Sacrifices feasts produce, \n Drinking then from feasts proceeds. \n \n B. Such rotation has its use. \n \n A. Then the drinking riot breeds; \n Then on riot and confusion \n Follow law and prosecution; \n Law brings sentence; sentence chains; \n Chains bring wounds and ulcerous pains. \n And Panyasis the epic poet allots the first cup of wine to the Graces,\n the Hours, and Bacchus; the second to Venus, and again to Bacchus; the third to\n Insolence and Destruction. And so he says\u2014 \n O'er the first glass the Graces three preside, \n And with the smiling Hours the palm divide; \n Next Bacchus, parent of the sacred vine, \n And Venus, loveliest daughter of the brine, \n Smile on the second cup, which cheers the heart, \n And bids the drinker home in peace depart. \n But the third cup is waste and sad excess, \n Parent of wrongs, denier of redress; \n Oh, who can tell what evils may befall \n When Strife and Insult rage throughout the hall? \n \n Content thee, then, my friend, with glasses twain; \n Then to your home and tender wife again; \n While your companions, with unaching heads, \n By your example taught, will seek their beds. \n But riot will be bred by too much wine, \n A mournful ending for a feast divine; \n While, then, you live, your thirst in bounds confine. \n And a few lines afterwards he says of immoderate drinking\u2014 \n For Insolence and Ruin follow it. \n According to Euripides, \n Drinking is sire of blows and violence. \n From which some have said that the pedigree of Bacchus and of Insolence\n were the same. \n ","3":"\n And Alexis says somewhere\u2014 \n Man's nature doth in much resemble wine: \n For young men and new wine do both need age \n To ripen their too warm unseason'd strength, \n And let their violence evaporate. \n But when the grosser portions are worked off, \n And all the froth is skilsm'd, then both are good'; \n The wine is drinkable, the man is wise, \n And both in future pleasant while they last. \n And according to the bard of Cyrene\u2014 \n Wine is like fire when 'tis to man applied, \n Or like the storm that sweeps the Libyan tide; \n The furious wind the lowest depths can reach, \n And wine robs man of knowledge, sense, and speech. \n But in some other place Alexis says the contrary to what I have just\n cited:\u2014 \n \n A. Man in no one respect resembles wine: \n For man by age is made intolerable; \n But age improves all wine. \n \n B. Yes; for old wines cheer us, \n But old men only snarl, abuse, and jeer us. \n And Panyasis says\u2014 \n Wine is like fire, an aid and sweet relief, \n Wards off all ills, and comforts every grief; \n Wine can of every feast the joys enhance, \n It kindles soft desire, it leads the dance. \n Think not then, childlike, much of solid food, \n But stick to wine, the only real good. \n \n And again\u2014 \n Good wine's the gift which God has given \n To man alone beneath the heaven; \n Of dance and song the genial sire, \n Of friendship gay and soft desire; \n Yet rule it with a tighten'd rein, \n Nor moderate wisdom's rules disdain; \n For when uncheck'd there's nought runs faster,\u2014 \n A useful slave, but cruel master. \n \n \n ","4":"\n Tim\u00e6us of Tauromenium relates that there was a certain house at Agrigentum called\n the Trireme, on this account:\u2014 Some young men got drunk in it, and got so mad when\n excited by the wine, as to think that they were sailing in a trireme, and that\n they were being tossed about on the sea m a violent storm; and so completely did\n they lose their senses, that they threw all the furniture, and all the sofas and\n chairs and beds, out of window, as if they were throwing them into the sea,\n fancying that the captain had ordered them to lighten the ship because of the\n storm. And though a crowd collected round the house and began to plunder what was\n thrown out, even that did not cure the young men of their frenzy. And the next\n day, when the pr\u00e6tors came to the house, there were the young men still lying,\n sea-sick as they said; and, when the magistrates questioned them, they replied\n that they had been in great danger from a storm, and had consequently been\n compelled to lighten the ship by throwing all their superfluous cargo into the\n sea. Arid while the magistrates marvelled at the bewilderment of the men, one of\n them, who seemed to be older than the rest, said, I, O Tritons, was so\n frightened that I threw myself down under the benches, and lay there as low\n down and as much out of sight as I could. And the magistrates forgave\n their folly, and dismissed them with a reproof, and a warning not to indulge in\n too much wine in future. And they, professing to be much obliged to them, said,\n If we arrive in port after having escaped this terrible storm, we will\n erect in our own country statues of you as our saviours in a conspicuous place,\n along with those of the other gods of the sea, as having appeared to us at a\n seasonable time. And from this circumstance that house was called the\n Trireme. \n ","5":"\n But Philochorus says that men who drink hard do not only show what sort of\n disposition they themselves are of, but do also reveal in\n their chattering the characters of every one else whom they know. Whence comes the\n proverb, \n Wine and truth; \n \n and the sentence, \n Wine lays bare the heart of man. \n And so in the contests of Bacchus the prize of victory is a tripod: and\n we have a proverb of those who speak truth, that they are speaking from the\n tripod; in which the tripod meant is the cup of Bacchus. For there were\n among the ancients two kinds of tripods, each of which, as it happened, bore the\n name of \u03bb\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03c2, or bowl; \n one, which was used to be put on the fire, being a sort of kettle for bathing, as\n Aeschylus says\u2014 \n They pour'd the water in a three-legg'd bowl, \n Which always has its place upon the fire: \n and the other is what is also called \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1, \n goblet. Homer says\u2014 \n And seven fireless tripods. \n And in these last they mixed wine; and it is this last tripod that is the\n tripod of truth; and it is considered appropriate to Apollo, because of the truth\n of his prophetic art; and to Bacchus, because of the truth which people speak when\n drunk. And Semus the Delian says\u2014 A brazen tripod, not the Pythian one, but\n that which they now call a bowl. And of these bowls some were never put on the\n fire, and men mixed their wine in them; and the others held water for baths,\n and in them they warmed the water, putting them on the fire; and of these some\n had ears, and having their bottom supported by three feet they were called\n tripods. \n \n Ephippus says somewhere or other\u2014 \n \n A. That load of wine makes you a chatterer. \n \n B. That's why they say that drunken men speak\n truth. \n And Antiphanes writes\u2014 \n There are only two secrets a man cannot keep, \n One when he's in love, t' other when he's drunk deep: \n For these facts are so proved by his tongue or his eyes, \n That we see it more plainly the more he denies. \n \n \n ","6":"\n And Philochorus relates that Amphictyon, the king of the Athenians, having learnt\n of Bacchus the art of mixing wine, was the first man who ever\n did mix it: and that it is owing to him that men who have been drinking on his\n system can walk straight afterwards, when before they used to blunder about after\n drinking sheer wine: and on this account he erected an altar to the Straight\n Bacchus in the temple of the Seasons; for they are the Nymphs who cherish the\n fruit or the vine. And near it he built also an altar to the Nymphs, as a memorial\n to all who use mixed drink; for the Nymphs are said to have been the nurses of\n Bacchus. And he made a law to bring an unmixed wine after meals only just enough\n to taste, as a token of the power of the Good Deity. But the rest of the wined was\n put on the table ready mixed, in whatever quantity any one chose. And then he\n enjoined the guests to invoke in addition the name of Jupiter the Saviour, for the\n sake of instructing and reminding the drinkers that by drinking in that fashion\n they would be preserved from injury. But Plato, in his second book of the Laws,\n says that the use of wine is to be encouraged for the sake of health. But on\n account of the look which habitual drunkards get, they liken Bacchus to a bull;\n and to a leopard, because he excites drunkards to acts of violence. And Alc\u00e6us\n says\u2014 \n Wine sometimes than honey sweeter, \n Sometimes more than nettles bitter. \n Some men, too, are apt to get in a rage when drunk; and they are like a\n bull. Euripides says\u2014 \n Fierce bulls, their passion with their horns displaying. \n And some men, from their quarrelsome disposition when drunk, are like\n wild beasts, on which account it is that Bacchus is likened to a leopard. \n ","7":"\n Well was it then that Ariston the Chian said that that was the most agreeable\n drink which partook at the same time of both sweetness and fragrance; for which\n reason some people prepare what is called nectar about the Olympus which is in\n Lydia, mixing wine and honeycombs and the most fragrant flowers together. Though I\n am aware indeed that Anaxandrides says that nectar is not the drink, but the meat\n of the gods:\u2014 \n Nectar I eat, and well do gnaw it; \n Ambrosia drink, (you never saw it); \n I act as cupbearer to Jove, \n And chat to Juno\u2014not of love; \n \n And oftentimes I sit by Venus, \n With marplot none to come between us. \n And Alcman says\u2014 \n Nectar they eat at will. \n And Sappho says\u2014 \n The goblets rich were with ambrosia crown'd, \n Which Hermes bore to all the gods around. \n But Homer was acquainted with nectar as the drink of the gods. And Ibycus\n says that ambrosia is nine times as sweet as honey; stating expressly that honey\n has just one-ninth part of the power of ambrosia as far as sweetness goes. \n ","8":"\n \n \n One fond of wine must be an honest man; \n For Bacchus, for his double mother famed, \n Loves not bad men, nor uninstructed clowns, \n says Alexis. He adds, moreover, that wine makes all men who drink much of\n it fond of talking. And the author of the Epigram on Cratinus says\u2014 \n \n If with water you fill up your glasses, \n You'll never write anything wise \n But wine is the horse of Parnassus, \n That carries a bard to the skies. \n \n \n And this was Cratinus's thought, \n Who was ne'er with one bottle content, \n But stuck to his cups as he ought, \n And to Bacchus his heart and voice lent. \n \n \n His house all with garlands did shine, \n And with ivy he circled his brow, \n To show he nought worshipp'd but wine, \n As, if he still lived, he'd do now. \n \n \n \n Polemo says that in Munychia a hero is honoured of the name of Acratopotes: \n and that among the Spartans statues of the heroes Matton and Ceraon were erected\n by some cooks in the hall of the Phiditia. And in Achaia a hero is honoured called Deipneus, having his name from\n \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, a supper. But from a dry meal there\n arise no jokes, nor extempore poems, though, on the other hand, such an one does\n not cause any boasting or insolence of mind; so that it is well said\u2014 \n Where are the empty boasts which Lemnos heard \n When season'd dishes press'd the ample board, \n When the rich goblets overflow'd with wine? \n \n though Aristarchus the grammarian put a mark against the line\n which represents the Greeks as getting insolent through much eating. For he said\n that it was not every sort of cheerfulness and satiety which engendered boasting\n and jesting and ridiculous actions; but that these things proceeded only from such\n revelling as made men beside themselves, and inclined them to falsehood,\u2014from\n drunkenness, in fact. \n ","9":"\n On which account Bacchylides says:\u2014 \n Sweet force, from wine proceeding, \n Now warms my soul with love, \n And on my spirit leading, \n With hopes my heart does move. \n It drives dull care away, \n And laughs at walls and towers; \n And bids us think and say, \n That all the world is ours. \n The man who drinks plenty of wine, \n Will never for wealth be wishing; \n For his cellar's a ceaseless mine, \n And an undisturb'd heart he is rich in. \n And Sophocles says\u2014 \n Drinking is a cure for woe. \n And other poets call wine\u2014 \n Fruit of the field, which makes the heart to leap. \n And the king of all poets introduces Ulysses saying\u2014 \n Let generous food supplies of strength produce, \n Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice, \n Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow, \n \n and so on. \n ","10":"\n It is in consequence of wine that both comedy and tragedy were discovered in\n Icarium, a village of Attica; and it was at the time of the grape harvest that\n these inventions were first introduced, from which comedy was at first called\n \u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1. \n \n Euripides, in the Bacch\u00e6, says that Bacchus \n Gave men the wine which every grief dispels; \n Where wine is not, there Venus never dwells, \n Nor any other thing which men hold dear. \n And Astydamas says that Bacchus \n Gave men the vine which cures all mortal grief, \n Parent of genial wine. \n \n For, says Antiphanes, a man who continually fills himself with wine becomes indifferent and careless; but he\n who drinks but little is very meditative. And Alexis says\u2014 \n I'm not beside myself with drink; nor have I so much taken \n As not to be quite understood by those to whom I'm speaking. \n But Seleucus says that it was not an ancient custom to indulge in wine or\n any other luxury to excess, except, indeed, on the occasion of some sacred\n festival; which is the origin of the names \u03b8\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \n and \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9. \u2014 \u03b8\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 meaning that men\n thought it right \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, to drink\n wine ###on account of the gods; \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 meaning\n that \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf, they assembled and met\n together in honour of the gods.

And Aristotle says that\n the word \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is derived from the fact that men\n used wine \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, after sacrificing. \n ","11":"\n Euripides says that it is possible that \n Those who with humble gifts approach the gods, \n May often holier be, than those who load \n The groaning altars with whole hecatombs; \n and the word \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, which he employs in\n the first line, means sacrifice. And Homer uses the same word when\n he says\u2014 \n God holds no sacrifice in more esteem, \n Than hearts where pious joy and pleasure beam. \n \n And we call those festivals which are of greater magnitude and which are\n celebrated with certain mysterious traditions, \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76 , on account of the expense which is lavished on them.

Alexis says\u2014 \n Those who with fair prosperity are bless'd, \n Should always keep themselves before the world; \n Glad to display the bounty of the gods. \n For they, the givers of all good, deserve \n A holy gratitude; and they will have it. \n But if, when they their gifts have shower'd, they see \n The objects of their bounty live like churls, \n Useless to all around them; who can wonder \n If they recall what seems so ill bestow'd? \n \n \n ","12":"\n A man is not fond of wine who has been used from his earliest years to drink\n water. But\u2014 \n 'Tis sweet, at a banquet or festival meeting, \n To chat o'er one's wine, when the guests have done eating, \n says Hesiod in his Melampodia. \n \n It has not occurred to any one of you to say a word about water, though wine is\n made of it, and though Pindar, the most grandiloquent of poets, has said that\n water is the best of all things. And Homer, too, the most divine\n of all poets, recognised it as a most nutritious thing, when he spoke of a grove\n of poplars nourished by the water. He also praises its transparent nature\u2014 \n Four fountains flow'd with clearest water white; \n \n and the water which is of a lighter nature, and of greater value, he\n calls lovely: at all events he calls the Titaresius lovely which\n falls into the Peneus. And he mentions also some water as especially good for\n washing; and Praxagoras of Cos, following his example, speaks of a water as\n beauteous\u2014 \n Beauteous it flows, to wash all dirt away. \n And he distinguishes also between sweet water and brackish ( \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2 ) water; though when he calls the Hellespont\n \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2, he uses the word in the sense of broad.\n But with respect to sweet water, he says\u2014 \n Near the sweet waters then our ships we stay'd. \n \n \n \n ","13":"\n He was acquainted too with the effect which warm water has on wounds: at all\n events he describes Eurypylus's wounds as being washed with it; and yet, if the\n object was to stop the hemorrhage, cold water would have been useful, since that\n contracts and closes up wounds; but with the view of relieving the pain, he bathes\n these with warm water, which has a soothing effect. And in Homer the word \u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 is used for what we call \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2, \n warm. And he shows that plainly enough in what he says\n about the fountains of the Scamander, saying\u2014 \n Next by Scamander's double source they bound, \n Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground; \n This warm, through scorching clefts is seen to rise, \n With exhalations steaming to the skies. \n \n Can we call that only warm from which a steam of\n fire, and a fiery smoke arises? But of the other source he says\u2014 \n That, the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows, \n Like crystal clear, and cold as winter's snows. \n And he often speaks of men newly wounded being bathed in warm water. In\n the case of Agamemnon he says\u2014 \n With his warm blood still welling from the wound. \n \n \n And in the case of a stag fleeing after it had been wounded,\n he says, in a sort of paraphrase\u2014 \n While his warm blood and mighty limbs were strong. \n \n The Athenians call \u03c7\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd, which is\n properly lukewarm, \n \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, as Eratosthenes uses the word, saying,\n Watery by nature, and lukewarm, \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2. \n \n \n ","14":"\n And of other waters, those which come from rocks he calls dark, as\n being quite useless; and he prefers to all others the waters of springs, and those\n which rise to the surface from a great depth, and through rich soil. As also\n Hesiod says\u2014 \n A ceaseless spring of clear untroubled flow. \n And Pindar says\u2014 \n Ambrosial water, like fresh honey sweet, \n Which from Tilphossa's lovely fountains flows; \n (Tilphossa is a fountain in B\u0153otia;) and Aristophanes says that Tiresias\n died from drinking of it, as at his advanced age he was unable to bear its extreme\n cold. And Theophrastus, in his book on Waters, says that the water of the Nile is\n the most productive and the sweetest of all waters, and that it is also very\n relaxing to the bowels of those who drink it, as it has in it a mixture of nitre.\n And again, in his book on Plants, he says that there is in some places water which\n has a procreative tendency; as for instance at Thespi\u00e6: and at Pyrrha there is a\n water which causes barrenness. But it happened once when there was a drought in\n the district around the Nile, that the water of that river became unwholesome, and\n many of the Egyptians died. Theophrastus states, moreover, that not only do bitter\n waters sometimes change their nature, but that salt water does so too, and\n sometimes whole rivers do so; as in the case of the fountain in Cith\u00e6ron, near\n which there is a temple of Jupiter; and of that in Cairo, near which there is a\n temple of Neptune: and the reason is, that many thunderbolts fall in those\n countries. \n ","15":"\n But there are some waters which have a good deal of body in them, and are of\n considerable weight; as that in Tr\u0153zen,\u2014for that gives the mouths of those who\n taste it a feeling of fulness. And the waters near the mines in Pang\u00e6um, in\n winter, weigh ninety-six drachms to half a pint, but in summer they only weigh\n forty-six. For the cold contracts and condenses it; on which account that which is\n used in hour- glasses does not make the hours in winter the\n same as those in summer, but longer; for the flow is slower on account of the\n increased density of the water. And he sys that the same is the case in Egypt,\n though the air there is softer. Brackish water is more earthy, and requires more\n working; as also does sea-water, the nature of which is warmer, and which is not\n exposed to the same changes as river-water And there is one salt spring which is\n of invincible hardness,\u2014I mean that of Arethusa. But as a general rule heavy\n waters are worse, and so are hard and cold waters, for the same reason; for they\n are not so easily prepared for use, some because they are very earthy, and some\n from the excess of cold. But those waters which are quickly warmed are light and\n wholesome. And in Crannon there is a spring of a gentle warmth, which keeps wine\n which is mixed with it of the same temperature for two or three days. But flowing\n waters, and waters from aqueducts, are, as a general rule, better than stagnant\n ones, being softer because of the collisions to which they are subjected; and on\n this account water derived from snow appears to be good, because its more\n drinkable qualities are brought to the surface, and are exposed to the influence\n of the air; and for the same reason they think it better than rain-water: and on\n the same ground, too, they prefer water from ice, because it is lighter; and the\n proof is, that ice is itself lighter than the rest of the water. But very cold\n water is hard, as being earthy; but that with much body in it, when it is warmed,\n is susceptible of greater heat, and when it is cold, descends to a more intense\n cold. And for the same reason water on the mountains is better to drink than water\n in the plains; for there is in such less admixture of earthy matter. And it is\n from the earthy particles present that waters vary in colour: at all events, the\n water of the lake at Babylon is red for some days after it is drawn; and that of\n the Borysthenes is for some time of a violet or dark colour, although it is\n unusually thin in quality; and a proof of this is, that at the point where it\n meets the Hypanis its waters flow above those of the latter while the north winds\n prevail. \n ","16":"\n And in many places there are fountains, some of which are good for drinking, and\n have a vinous flavour; as for instance, one in Paphlagonia, which they say the\n natives come to for the express purpose of drinking. Some, again, are salt, with\n a rather bitter flavour; as some among the Sicani in\n Sicily. And in the Carthaginian dominions there is a fountain on which there is\n something which floats resembling oil, but darker in colour, which they skim off\n and make into balls, and use for their sheep and cattle; and in other districts,\n too, there are fountains of a greasy nature,\u2014like the one in Asia concerning which\n Alexander wrote a letter, saying that he had found a fountain of oil. And of\n waters which are warm by nature some are sweet, as that at Aegee in Cilicia, and\n that at Pagas\u00e6, and that at Larissa in the Troas, and that near Magnesia, and that\n in Melos, and that in Lipara, and that in Prusa,\u2014the Prusa, I mean, near Mount\n Olympus in Mysia,\u2014which is called the Royal fountain. But that in Asia near\n Tralles, and those near the river Characometes, and near the city of Mysia, are so\n oily that those who bathe in them have no need of oil. And there is a similar\n fountain in the village of Dascylum. There is also one at Carura of an exceeding\n dryness and heat: and there is another near Menoscome, which is a village in\n Phrygia, of a rougher and a more nitrous quality; as there is too in a village in\n Phrygia, called The Lion's Village. And there is a spring near Doryl\u00e6um, which is\n very delicious to drink; but those which are at Bai\u00e6 or Baium, a harbour in Italy,\n are utterly undrinkable. \n ","17":"\n I myself weighed the water which comes from the fountain called Pirene in Corinth,\n and found it lighter than any other water in Greece. For I did not believe\n Antiphanes the comic writer, who says that in many respects Attica is superior to\n all other districts, and also that it has the best water of any; for he says:\u2014\n \n \n \n A. Have you remark'd, my friend, \n That none can with this favour'd land contend \n In honey, loaves, and figs? \n \n \n \n B. Aye, figs indeed! \n \n A. In myrtles, perfumes, wools, in choicest\n breed \n Of cattle, and in cheese; and on what ground \n Can fountains like the Attic springs be found? \n \n Eubulus, the writer of comedies, somewhere or other says that Ch\u00e6remon\n the tragedian called water the body of the river:\u2014 \n But when we pass'd the folds, and cross'd the water, \n The river's lucid body, all our troops \n In the pure crystal bathed their weary limbs, \n \n There is a fountain in Tenos the water of which cannot be\n mixed with wine. And Herodotus, in his fourth book, says that the Hypanis, at a\n distance of five days' journey from its head, is thin and sweet to the taste; but\n that four days' journey further on it becomes bitter, because some bitter spring\n falls into it. And Theopompus says that near the river Erigone all the water is\n sour; and that those who drink of it become intoxicated, just like men who have\n drunk wine. \n ","18":"\n But Aristobulus of Cassandra says that there is a fountain in Miletus called the\n Achillean, the stream of which is very sweet, while the sediment is brackish: this\n is the water in which the Milesians say that their hero bathed when he had slain\n Trambelus the king of the Leleges. And they say, too, that the water in Cappadocia\n never becomes putrid, but there is a great deal in that district, of an admirable\n quality, though it has no outlet unless it flows underground. And Ptolemy the\n king, in the Seventh Book of his Commentaries, says that as you go to Corinth\n through the district called Contoporia, when you have got to the top of the\n mountain there is a fountain whose waters are colder than snow, so that many\n people are afraid to drink of it lest they should be frozen; but he says that he\n drank of it himself. And Phylarchus states that at Cleitor there is a spring which\n gives those who drink of it a distaste for the smell of wine. And Clearchus tells\n us that water is called white, like milk; and that wine is called red, like\n nectar; and that honey and oil are called yellow, and that the juice which is\n extracted from the myrtle-berry is black. Eubulus says that \"water makes those who\n drink nothing else very ingenious, \n But wine obscures and clouds the mind;\" \n and Philetas borrows not only the thought, but the lines. \n ","19":"\n Athen\u00e6us then, having delivered this lecture on water, like a rhetorician, stopped\n awhile, and then began again. \n Amphis, the comic writer, says somewhere or other\u2014 \n There is, I take it, often sense in wine, \n And those are stupid who on water dine. \n And Antiphanes says\u2014 \n Take the hair, it well is written, \n Of the dog by whom you're bitten. \n Work off one wine by his brother, \n And one labour with another; \n \n Horns with horns, and noise with noise, \n One crier with his fellow's voice \n Insult with insult, war with war, \n Faction with faction, care with care; \n Cook with cook, and strife with strife, \n Business with business, wife with wife. \n \n \n The ancients applied the word \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd even to\n unmixed water. Sophron says\u2014 \n \n Pour unmix'd water \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd in the cup. \n \n ","20":"\n Phylarchus says that Theodorus the Larisssean was a water-drinker; the man, I\n mean, who was always so hostile to king Antigonus. He asserts also that all the\n Spaniards drink water, though they are the richest of all men, for they have the\n greatest abundance of gold and silver in their country. And he says, too, that\n they eat only once a day, out of stinginess, though they wear most expensive\n clothes. And Aristotle or Theophrastus speaks of a man named Philinus as never\n having taken any drink or solid food whatever, except milk alone, during the whole\n of his life. And Pythermus, in his account of the tyrants of Pir\u00e6us, mentions\n Glaucon as having been a water-drinker. And Hegesander the Delphian says that\n Anchimolus and Moschus, sophists who lived in Elis, were water-drinkers all their\n lives; and that they ate nothing but figs, and for all that, were quite as healthy\n and vigorous as any one else; but that their perspiration had such an offensive\n smell, that every one avoided them at the baths. And Matris the Athenian, as long\n as he lived, ate nothing except a few myrtle-berries each day, and abstained from\n wine and every other kind of drink except water. Lamprus, too, the musician, was a\n water-drinker, concerning whom Phrynichus says, that the gulls lamented,\n when Lamprus died among them, being a man who was a water-drinker, a subtle\n hypersophist, a dry skeleton of the Muses, an ague to nightingales, a hymn to\n hell. And Machon the comic poet mentions Moschion as a\n water-drinker. \n ","21":"\n But Aristotle, in his book on Drunkenness, says, that some men who have been fond\n of salt meat have yet not had their thirst stimulated by it; of whom Archonides\n the Argive was one. And Mago the Carthaginian passed three times through the\n African desert eating dry meal and never drinking And Polemo the Academic\n philosopher, from the time that he was thirty years of age to\n the day of his death, never drank anything but water, as is related by Antigonus\n the Carystian. And Demetrius the Scepsian says that Diocles of Peparethus drank\n cold water to the day of his death. And Demosthenes the orator, who may well be\n admitted as a witness in his own case, says that he drank nothing but water for a\n considerable length of time. And Pyheas says, But you see the demagogues of\n the present day, Demosthenes and Demades, how very differently they live. For\n the one is a water-drinker, and devotes his nights to contempla- tion, as they\n say; and the other is a debauchee, and is drunk every day, and comes like a\n great potbellied fellow, as he is, into our assemblies. And Euphorion\n the Chalcidean writes in this way:\u2014\"Lasyrtas the Lasionian never required drink as\n other men do, and still it did not make him different from other men. And many\n men, out of curiosity, were careful to watch him, but they desisted before they\n ascertained what was the truth. For they continued watching him for thirty days\n together in the summer season, and they saw that he never abstained from salt\n meat, and yet that, though drinking nothing, he seemed to have no complaint in his\n bladder. And so they believed that he spoke the truth. And he did, indeed,\n sometimes take drink, but still he did not require it. \n \n A change of meat is often good, \n And men, when tired of common food, \n Redoubled pleasure often feel, \n When sitting at a novel meal. \n \n ","22":"\n The king of Persia, as Herodotus relates in his first book, drank no water, except\n what came from the river Choaspes, which flows by Susa. And when he was on a\n journey, he had numbers of four-wheeled waggons drawn by mules following him,\n laden with silver vessels containing this water, which was boiled to make it keep.\n And Ctesias the Cnidian explains also in what manner this water was boiled, and\n how it was put into the vessels and bought to the king, saying that it was the\n lightest and sweetest of all waters. And the second king of Egypt, he who was\n surnamed Philadelphus, having given his daughter Berenice in marriage to Antiochus\n the king of Syria, took the trouble to send her water from the river Nile, in\n order that his child might drink of no other river, as Polybius relates. And Heliodorus tells us, that Antiochus Epiphanes, whom Polybius\n calls Epimanes, on account of his actions, mixed the\n fountain at Antioch with wine; a thing which Theopompus relates to have been also\n done by the Phrygian Midas, when he wished to make Silenus drunk in order to catch\n him. And that fountain is, as Bion relates, between the M\u00e6di and the P\u00e6onians, and\n is called Inna. But Staphylus says, that Melampus was the first who invented the\n idea of mixing wine with water. And Plistonicus says that water is more digestible\n than wine. \n ","23":"\n Now men who drink hard before eating, are usually not very comfortable in their\n digestion, which are apt to get out of order by such a system, and what they eat\n often turns sour on the stomach. So that a man who has a regard for his health,\n ought to take regular exercise, for the sake of promoting frequent perspiration;\n and he ought also to use the bath regularly for the sake of moistening and\n relaxing his body. And besides this, and before he bathes, he should drink water,\n as being an excellent thing,\u2014drinking warm water usually in winter and spring, and\n cold water in summer, in order not to weaken the stomach. But he should only drink\n in moderation before the bath or the gymnasium, for the sake of diffusing what he\n drinks throughout his system beforehand, and in order to prevent the unmixed\n strength of wine from having too much effect on his extremities. And if any one\n thinks it too much trouble to live on this system, let him take sweet wine, either\n mixed with water or warmed, especially that which is called \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, the sweet Lesbian wine, as being very good for the\n stomach. \n Now sweet wines do not make the head heavy, as Hippocrates says in his book on\n Diet, which some entitle, The Book on Sharp Pains; others,\n The Book on Barley-water; and others, The Book against\n the Cnidian Theories. His words are: Sweet wine is less\n calculated to make the head heavy, and it takes less hold of the mind, and\n passes through the bowels easier than other wine. But Posidonius says,\n that it is not a good thing to pledge one's friends as the Carmani do; for they,\n when at their banquets they wish to testify their friendship for each other, cut\n the veins on their faces, and mingle the blood which flows down with the liquor,\n and then drink it; thinking it the very extremes proof of\n friendship to taste one another's blood. And after pledging one another in this\n manner, they anoint their heads with ointment, especially with that distilled from\n roses, and if they cannot get that, with that distilled from apples, in order to\n ward off the effects of the drink, and in order also to avoid being injured by the\n evaporation of the wine; ad if they cannot get ointment of apples, they then use\n that extracted from the iris or from spikenard, so that Alexis very neatly\n says\u2014 \n \n His nose he anoints, and thinks it plain \n 'Tis good for health with scents to feed the brain \n \n ","24":"\n But one ought to avoid thick perfumes, and to drink water which is thin and\n transparent, and which in respect of weight is light, and which has no earthy\n particles in it. And that water is best which is of a moderate heat or coldness,\n and which, when poured into a brazen or silver vessel, does not produce a blackish\n sediment. Hippocrates says, Water which is easily warmed or easily chilled\n is always lighter. But that water is bad which takes a long time to\n boil vegetables; and so too is water full of nitre, or brackish. And in his book\n upon Waters, Hippocrates calls good water drinkable; but stagnant water he calls\n bad, such as that from ponds or marshes. And most spring-water is rather hard. But\n Erasistratus says that some people test water by weight, and that is a most stupid\n proceeding. For just look, says he, if men compare the water\n from the fountain Amphiaraus with that from the Eretrian spring, though one of\n them is good and the other bad, there is absolutely no difference in their\n respective weights. And Hippocrates, in his book on Places, says that\n those waters are the best which flow from high ground, and from dry hills,\n for they are white, and sweet, and are able to bear very little wine,\n and are warm in winter and cold in summer. And he praises those most,\n the springs of which break towards the east, and especially towards the\n north-east, for they must inevitably be clear, and fragrant, and light. Diodes\n says that water is good for the digestion, and not apt to cause flatulency, that\n it is moderately cooling, and good for the eyes, and that it has no tendency to\n make the head feel heavy, and that it adds vigour to the mind and body. And\n Praxagoras says the same; and he also praises rain-water. But\n Euenor praises water from cisterns, and says that the best is that from the\n cistern of Amphiaraus, when compared with that from the fountain in Eretria. \n ","25":"\n But that water is undeniably nutritious is plain from the fact that some animals\n are nourished by it alone, as for instance, grasshoppers. And there are many other\n liquids which are nutritious, such as milk, barley-water, and wine. At all events,\n animals at the breast are nourished by milk; and there are many nations who drink\n nothing but milk. And it is said that Democritus, the philosopher of Abdera, after\n he had determined to rid himself of life on account of his extreme old age, and\n when he had begun to diminish his food day by day, when the day of the\n Thesmophorian festival came round, and the women of his household besought him not\n to die during the festival, in order that they might not be debarred from their\n share in the festivities, was persuaded, and ordered a vessel full of honey to be\n set near him: and in this way he lived many days with no other support than honey;\n and then some days after, when the honey had been taken away, he died. But\n Democritus had always been fond of honey; and he once answered a man, who asked\n him how he could live in the enjoyment of the best health, that he might do so if\n he constantly moistened his inward parts with honey, and his outward man with oil.\n And bread and honey was the chief food of the Pythagoreans, according to the\n statement of Aristoxenus, who says that those who eat this for breakfast were free\n from disease all their lives. And Lycus says that the Cyrneans (and they are a\n people who live near Sardinia) are very long-lived, because they are continually\n eating honey; and it is produced in great quantities among them. \n ","26":"\n When he says, men have adjourned the investigation into all such matters, he uses\n the word \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 instead of \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n The word \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 is used in the same sense as\n \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, \n i.e. \n fasting (just as we find \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2 and \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2 ) by Cratinus,\n when he says\u2014 \n For you are not the first who's come to supper \n After a lengthened fast, \n And the word \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is used by\n Diphilus for hungry \u2014 \n \n I'm glad when those who set them up as wise, \n Are naked seen and hungry. \n And Antiphanes says\u2014 \n \n A.

And on this\n account Artaxerxes, having a high esteem for Timagoras the Cretan, or, as Phanias\n the Peripatetic says, for Entimus the Gortinian, who went up to the king in\n rivalry of Themistocles, gave him a tent of extraordinary size and beauty, and a\n couch with silver feet; and he sent him also expensive coverlets, and a man to\n arrange them, saying that the Greeks did not know how to arrange a couch.

Nor was this compliment paid to Timagoras the Athenian,\n who submitted to offer adoration t the king, and who was held in the highest\n honour by him, though some of the things which were set before the kin were sent\n to him from the royal table.

And the Persians\n were very indignant this, thinking that it was making such an\n honour too common, and also because they thought they were on the eve of another\n expedition against Greece. He sent him also a couch with silver feet, and cushions\n for it, and a flowered tent surmounted with a canopy, and a silver chair, and a\n gilt parasol, and some golden vessels inlaid with precious stones, and a hundred\n large vessels of silver, and silver bowls, and a hundred girls, and a hundred\n boys, and six thousand pieces of gold, besides what was allowed him for his daily\n expenses. \n ","31":"\n There were tables with ivory feet, the top slabs of which were made of maple wood.\n Cratinus says\u2014 \n Fair girls await you, and a table \n Of highly polish'd dappled maple. \n And when one of the Cynics used the word \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, meaning a table, Ulpian got indignant and said, \"To-day I\n seem to have trouble coming on me arising out of my actual want of business; for\n what does this fellow mean by his tripod, unless indeed he counts Diogenes' stick\n and his two feet, and so makes him out to be a tripod'?

Now many of the ancient writers mention\n Damascus, a city of great reputation and importance; and as there is a great\n quantity of plum-trees in the territory of the Damascenes, and as they are\n cultivated there with exceeding care, the tree itself has got to be called a\n Damascene, as being a kind of plum different from what is found in other\n countries. The fruit is more like prunes. And many writers speak of them, and\n Hipponax says\u2014 \n I have a garland of damascenes and mint. \n And Alexis says\u2014 \n \n A. And in my sleep I thought I saw a prize. \n \n B. What was it? \n \n A. Listen.\u2014There came up to me, \n While still within th' arena's spacious bounds, \n One of my rivals, bringing me a crown- \n A ripe revolving crown of damascenes. \n \n B. Oh Hercules! and were the damascenes ripe? \n And again he says\u2014 \n Did you e'er see a sausage toasted, \n Or dish of tripe well stuff'd and roasted? \n Or damascenes stew'd in rich confection\u2014 \n Such was that gentleman's complexion. \n Nicander says\u2014 \n The fruit they call a plum, the cuckoo's prize. \n But Clearchus the Peripatetic says that the Rhodians and Sicilians call\n plums \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1, and so Theocritus the Syracusan\n uses the word\u2014 \n Heavy with plums, the branches swept the ground. \n And again he says\u2014 \n Far as the apple doth the plum surpass. \n But the damascene is smaller in circumference than other plums, though in\n flavour it is very like them, except that it is a little sharper. Seleucus, in his\n Dictionary, says that \n \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1, \u1f26\u03bb\u03b1, \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1, and \u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1 are all different names for the same thing; and that plums\n are called \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1, as being good for the stomach,\n and \u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u1f70\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1, , that is, assisting to\n remove the food; and \u1f26\u03bb\u03b1, which is the same word\n as \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b1 , meaning simply fruit, as Demetrius Ixion says in his Etymology. And Theophrastus says,\n \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 : \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 being a kind of wild plum. And Araros calls the tree which\n bears the fruit \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, and the fruit itself\n \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. And Diphilus of Siphnos pronounces\n plums to be juicy, digestible, and easily evacuated, but not very nutritious. \n ","33":"\n There is another fruit, called Cherries.\u2014Theophrastus says, in his book on Plants,\n that the Cherry-tree is a tree of a peculiar character, and of large size, for it\n grows to a height of four-and-twenty cubits, and its leaf is like\n that of the medlar, but somewhat harder and thicker, and its bark like the linden;\n its flower is white, like that of the pear or the medlar, consisting of a number\n of small petals of a waxy nature; its fruit is red, like that of the lotus in\n appearance, and of the size of a bean; but the kernel of the lotus is hard, while\n that of the cherry is soft. And again he says, The \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, which some call \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd, has a spreading leaf like a medlar, only that is\n larger, and wider, and longer; and it has no deep grain in it as the medlar\n has. The tree is neither very tall nor very large; the wood is variegated,\n yellow, and strong: it has a smooth bark, like that of the medlar; and a single\n root, which goes down very deep into the earth; the fruit is round, of the size\n of an olive; when fully ripe it is of a yellow colour, becoming gradually\n darker; and from its flavour and juice it might almost be taken for a wild\n medlar. By which description of the crat\u00e6gus it appears to me that he\n means the tree which is now called the cherry. \n ","34":"\n Asclepiades of Myrlea speaks of a tree which he calls the Ground-cherry, and says,\n In the land of the Bithynians there is found the ground-cherry, the root\n of which is not large; nor is the tree, but like a rose-bush; in all other\n respects the fruit is like the common cherry; but it makes those who eat much\n of it feel heavy, as wine does, and it gives them head-aches. These are\n the words of Asclepiades. And it appears to me that he is speaking of the arbutus.\n For the tree which bears the arbutus-berry answers his\n descrip- tion, and if a man eats more than six or seven of the berries he gets a\n headache. Aristophanes says\u2014 \n And planted by no hand, the arbutus \n Makes red the sunny hills. \n Theopompus says\u2014 \n The myrtle berries and red arbutus. \n Crates says\u2014 \n Beauteous the breast of tender maid, \n As arbutus or apples red. \n And Amphis\u2014 \n Mulberries you see, my friend, are found \n On the tree which we know as the mulberry; \n So the oak bears the acorn round, \n And the arbutus shines with its full berry. \n And Theophrastus tells us, The \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (as he calls it) is the tree which bears the arbutus\n berry. \n \n There is question about the Agen, a satyric drama, whether it was\n composed by Python, (and if by him whether he was a native of Catana or of\n Byzantium,) or by the king Alexander himself. \n Then Laurentius says\u2014 You, O Greeks, lay claim to a good many things, as\n either having given the names to them, or having been the original discoverers\n of them. But you do not know that Lucullus, the Roman general, who subdued\n Mithridates and Tigranes, was the first man who Introduced this plant into\n Italy from Cerasus, a city of Pontus; and he it was who gave the fruit the\n Latin name of Cerasus, cherry, after the name of the\n city, as our historians relate. \n \n Then Daphnis answers\u2014 But there was a very celebrated man, Diphilus of\n Siphnos, many years more ancient than Lucullus, for he was born in the time of\n king Lysimachus, (who was one of the successors of Alexander,) and he speaks of\n cherries, saying, 'Cherries are good for the stomach, and juicy, but not very\n nutritious; if taken after drinking cold water they are especially wholesome;\n but the red and the Milesian are the best kinds, and are diuretic.' \n \n ","35":"\n There is a fruit usually called the \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \n which the people of Alexandria call the \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, in\n which they differ from every one else; but it has no connexion with the Egyptian\n fig, which some call \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, and which the natives scrape slightly with a knife, and\n then leave on the tree; and then when it has been tossed about by the wind, within\n three days it becomes ripe and fragrant, (especially if the wind is west,) and\n very good to eat, as there is something in it which is moderately cooling for\n people in a fever, when made up with oil of roses into a plaster, so as to be put\n upon the stomach, and it is no slight relief to the patient. Now the Egyptian\n sycaminus bears its fruit on the main stem, and not on the branches. But the\n sycaminus is a mulberry, a fruit mentioned by Aeschylus in his Phrygians, where he\n says of Hector, \n His heart was softer than a mulberry. \n And in his Cretan Women he says of the brier\u2014 \n As the full branch to earth is Weigh'd \n With mulberries, white and black and red. \n And Sophocles has the lines\u2014 \n First you shall see the full white ear of corn, \n And then the large round rosy mulberry. \n And Nicander in his Georgics says that it is the first of all fruits to\n appear; and he calls the tree which bears it \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1, as also do the Alexandrians\u2014 \n The mulberry-tree, in which the young delight, \n Brown autumn's harbinger. \n \n \n ","36":"\n Phanias of Eresus, the pupil of Aristotle, calls the fruit of the wild sycamine\n \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, or mulberry, being a fruit of the\n greatest sweetness and delicacy when it is ripe. And he writes thus: The\n mulberry is a briery sort of tree, and when the round fruit is dried it has\n small pips of seed, woven in like net-work, and the fruit is nutritious and\n juicy. And Parthanius has the following words:\u2014 \u1fde\u1f05\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1, that is to say, \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, \n which some call mulberries.\" And Salmonius calls the same tree \u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, or brier. And Demetrius Ixion says the \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd and \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd are\n the same, being a very juicy fruit, superior to the fig. And Diphilus of Siphnos,\n who was a physician, writes thus: The \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, which are also called \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1, are moderately full of good juice, but have not much\n nourishment; they are good for the stomach and easily digested; and those which\n are not quite ripe have a peculiar quality of expelling\n worms. But Pythemus states, according to Hegesander, that in his time\n the mulberry-trees produced no fruit for twenty years, and that during that time\n gout became so epidemic, that not only men, but even boys and girls, and eunuchs,\n and women, were afflicted with it; and even herds of goats were attacked with it,\n so that two-thirds of the cattle were afflicted with the same disorder. \n ","37":"\n With respect to the word \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1, the Attic writers\n and all other prose writers call nearly all berries by the generic name of\n \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1, \n nuts. And Epicharmus calls the almond the\n nut, by way of distinction, as we do, saying\u2014 \n We eat roast nuts, that is, almonds. \n Philyllius says\u2014 \n Eggs, nuts, almonds. \n And Heracleon the Ephesian writes\u2014 They called almonds \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1, and chestnuts, which we now call \u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 . The tree itself is called \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03b1 by Sophocles, who says\u2014 \n ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9, ) nut-trees \n and ash-trees. \n And Eubulus speaks of \n Beeches, nut-trees, Carystian nuts. \n There are some kinds of nuts, too, which are called \u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1. \n \n ","38":"\n With respect to Almonds.\u2014The Naxian almonds are mentioned by the ancient writers;\n and those in the island of Naxos are superior to all others, as I am well\n persuaded. Phrynichus says\u2014 \n He knock'd out all my grinders, so that now \n A Naxian almond I can hardly crack. \n The almonds in the island of Cyprus also are very excellent, and in\n comparison of those which come from other quarters, they are very long, and\n slightly bent at the end. And Seleucus in his Dictionary says, that the\n Laced\u00e6monians call soft nuts \u03bc\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. And the\n Servians give that name to sweet nuts. But Arnexias says that it is the almond\n which is called \u03bc\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. We may add, there is\n nothing which is a greater provocative of drinking than almonds when eaten before\n meals. Eupolis says in his Taxiarchs\u2014 \n Give me some Naxian almonds to regale me, \n And from the Naxian vines some wine to drink. \n For there was a vine called the Naxian vine. \n \n And Plutarch of Ch\u00e6ronea says, that there was in the retinue of Drusus the son of\n Tiberius C\u00e6sar, a certain physician who surpassed all men in drinking, and who was\n detected in always eating five or six bitter almonds before he drank. But when he\n was prevented from eating them he was not able to stand even a very limited\n quantity of wine; and the cause of this was the great power of the bitterness of\n the almond, which is of a very drying nature, and which has the quality of\n expelling moisture. \n Herodian of Alexandria says, that almonds derive the name of \u1f00\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9, because beneath their green bark they have many \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u1f76, or lacerations. \n Philemon says somewhere or other\u2014 \n You, like an ass, come to the husks of the dessert; \n and Nicander, in the second book of his Georgics, says\u2014 \n \n Beech-trees, the ornament of Pan. \n \n We also find the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd in the neuter\n gender. Diphilus says\u2014 \n \n Sweetmeats, myrtle-berries, cheese-cakes, almonds, \n \n using the neuter \u1f00\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1. \n \n ","39":"\n Now with respect to the pronunciation and accent of the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 , Pamphilus thinks that there ought to be a grave accent\n when it means the fruit, as it is in the case of \u1f00\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. But he wants to circumflex the word when it means the\n tree, thus, \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u1fc6 like \u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u1fc6. And Archilochus says\u2014 \n The lovely flower of the rose-tree ( \u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u1fc6\u03c2 ). \n But Aristarchus marks the word, whether it means the fruit or the tree,\n with an acute accent indifferently; while Philoxenus would circumflex the word in\n either sense. Eupolis says\u2014 \n You'll ruin me, I swear it by the almond. \n Aristophanes says\u2014 \n \n A. Come, now, take these almonds, \n And break them \n ( B. I would rather break your head,) with a\n stone. \n And Phrynichus says\u2014 \n The almond is a good cure for a cough. \n And others speak of almonds as beautiful. But Tryphon in his book on\n Attic Prosody accents \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, when meaning the fruit, with a grave accent, which we use in the neuter as\n \u1f00\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. But he writes \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u1fc6, with a circumflex for the tree; it being as it were a\n possessive form derived from the fruit, and as such contracted and\n circumflexed. \n Pamphilus in his Dictionary says that the \u03bc\u03c5\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd is called the nut-cracker by the Laced\u00e6monians, when\n they mean the almond-cracker; for the Laced\u00e6monians call almonds \u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n ","40":"\n Nicander mentions also nuts of Pontus, which some writers call \u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1 ; while Hermonax and Timachidas, in the\n Dictionary, say that the acorn of Jupiter, or walnut, is what is called the nut of\n Pontus. \n But Heraclides of Tarentum asks, Whether sweetmeats ought to be put on the\n table before supper, as is done in some parts of Asia and Greece; or whether\n they ought to be brought on after supper is over. If it is decided that\n they are to be brought on at the end of supper, then it follows, that when a great\n deal of food has already been put into the stomach and bowels, the nuts which are\n eaten afterwards as provocatives of drinking, get entangled with the rest of the\n food, and produce flatulence, and also cause what has been eaten to turn on the\n stomach, because it is followed by what is by nature unmanageable and\n indigestible; and it is from such food that indigestions and attacks of diarrh\u0153a\n arise. \n ","41":"\n Diodes asserts that almonds are nutritious and good for the stomach, and that they\n have a heating effect because they contain something like millet; but green\n almonds are less likely to have an injurious effect than dry ones; and almonds\n soaked in water have such an effect less than those which are not soaked; and when\n toasted less than when raw. But walnuts, which are also called nuts of Heraclea,\n and acorns of Jupiter, are not indeed so nutritious as almonds, but still they\n have something like millet in them, and something apt to rise to the surface; so,\n if they are eaten in ay quantity they make the head feel heavy; they, however, are\n less likely to produce injurious effects when green than when dry. \n Persian nuts too are as apt to produce headches as the acorns of Jupiter; but they\n are more nutritious, though they make the throat and mouth feel rough; but when\n they are roasted they are less injurious, and when eaten with honey, they are the\n most digestible of all nuts The broad Persian nuts have the\n greatest tendency to produce flatulence; but when boiled they are less injurious\n than when raw, or even when roasted. But Philotimus in his treatises on\n Nourishment says, The broad nut, and that which is called the Sardinian\n nut, are both exceedingly indigestible when raw, and are very slow in\n dissolving in the stomach, as they are kept down by the phlegm in the stomach,\n and as they themselves are of an astringent nature. The Pontic nut too is oily\n and indigestible; but the almond is not so indigestible as that, and\n accordingly if we eat a number of them we do not feel any inconvenience; and\n they appear more oily, and give out a sweet and oily juice. \n \n Diphilus of Siphnos says\u2014 There is a nut called the Royal nut, which causes\n severe headaches, and keeps rising in the stomach; and there are two sorts of\n them, one of which, that which is tender and white, is the more juicy and the\n better; but that which is roasted in ovens is not nutritious. Almonds have a\n tendency to make people thin, and are diuretic and cathartic, and far from\n nutritious; and the dry ones are far more apt to produce flatulence and are far\n more indigestible than the green ones, which do not give much juice, and which\n are not very nutritious; but those which are tender, and full, and white, being\n like milk, are more full of wholesome juice. And the Thasian and Cyprian nuts,\n being tender, are far more easily digested than dry ones. The nuts of Pontus\n are apt to produce headaches, but still they are not so indigestible as the\n Royal nuts. \n \n ","42":"\n Moreover, Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his book on Comestibles, says, The\n digestion of Eub\u0153an nuts or chestnuts (for they are called by both names) is\n very difficult for the stomach, and is attended with a great deal of\n flatulence. And they are apt to thicken the juice, and to make people fat,\n unless their constitution is strong enough to neutralise them. But almonds, and\n likewise the nuts of Heraclea, and the Persian nuts, and all others of the same\n sort, are still worse than these: and it is desirable to touch absolutely none\n whatever of these things unless they are first cooked by fire; with the\n exception of, perhaps, the green almonds. But one should boil some of them, and\n roast others; for some of them are of an oily nature, as the dry almonds and\n the acorns of Jupiter; but some are hard and harsh, as the nuts of the beech and all that kind. And from the oily sorts the action\n of the fire extracts the oil, which is the worst part of them: but those which\n are hard and harsh are softened, and, so to say, ripened, if any one cooks them\n over a small and gentle fire. \n \n But Diphilus calls chestnuts also Sardinian acorn, saying that they are very\n nutritious, and full of excellent juice; but not very easy of digestion, because\n they remain a long time in the stomach; that, however, when they are roasted they\n are less nutritious, but more digestible; and that when boiled they are less apt\n to produce flatulence than the others, and more nutritious. \n It is easily peel'd, and the Eub\u0153ans \n Call it a nut, but some people have call'd it an acorn, \n says Nicander the Colophonian, in his Georgics. But Agelochus calls\n chestnuts \u1f04\u03bc\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1, and says, Where the\n Sinopean nuts are produced the natives call the trees which produce them\n \u1f04\u03bc\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1. \n \n \n ","43":"\n With respect to Vetches.\u2014Crobylus says\u2014 \n They took a green vetch, \n And toss'd it empty, as if playing cottabus. \n These are the sweetmeats of the wretched monkey. \n And Homer says\u2014 \n Black beans spring up, or vetches. \n Xenophanes the Colophonian says, in his Parodies\u2014 \n These are what one should talk of near the fire, \n In winter season, on soft couch reclined, \n After a plenteous meal, drinking rich wine, \n And eating vetches. Then a man may ask, \n \"Who are you? How old are you, my friend? \n How many years old were you when the Mede came\" \n And Sappho says\u2014 \n Golden vetches on the sea-shore grew. \n But Theophrastus, in his book on Plants, calls some kinds of vetches\n \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9. And Sophilus says\u2014 \n This maiden's sire is far the greatest man, \n A regular \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 vetch. \n And Phenias says, in his book about Plants,\u2014 While they are green\n and tender, the bean and vetch take the place of \n sweetmeats; but when they are dry they are usually eaten boiled or\n roasted. Alexis says\u2014 \n My husband is a poor old man, and I \n Am an old woman, and I have a daughter \n And a young son, \n And this good girl besides\u2014we're five in all\u2014 \n And three of them are now at supper, \n And we two who here remain share with them \n A little maize; and when we have nothing \n To eat, we utter a wail unsuited to the lyre. \n And as we never have any meat for dinner, \n Our countenance is become pale. These are the parts, \n And this is the arrangement of our life: \n Beans, lupins, cabbages, rape, \n Pulse, morepulse, mastnuts, onions. \n Grasshoppers, vetches, wild pears, \n And that which was given by my mother \n As an object of devout care, the fig, \n The great invention of the Phrygian fig. \n Pherecrates says\u2014 \n You must at once take care and make the vetches tender. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n He was choked eating roasted vetches. \n And Diphilus says\u2014 Vetches are very indigestible, create moisture,\n they are also diuretic, and apt to cause flatulence. And according to\n Diocles, they produce a sort of fermentation in the body. The white vetches are\n better than the black; and so also are the yellow or box-coloured. And the\n Milesian are better than those called \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 ; and\n the green are better than the dry, and those which have been soaked are better\n than those which have not been. The discoverer of the vetch is said to have been\n Neptune. \n ","44":"\n With respect to Lupins. Alexis says\u2014 \n A curse upon the man; \n Let him not come near me, who eats lupins in season, \n And then leaves the husks and shells in the vestibules \n Why was he not choked while eating them I know, \n I know most certainly, that Cle\u00e6netus the tragedian \n Did not eat them. For Cle\u00e6netus \n Never threw away the husk of a single vegetable, \n So exceedingly economical is that man. \n And Lycophron of Chalcis, in a satiric drama which he wrote against\n Menedemus the philosopher, for the purpose of turn- ing him\n into ridicule, (it was from Menedemus that the sect of the Eretrians derived its\n name,) laughs at the suppers of the philosophers, and says\u2014 \n The lupin, common to all the people, in great plenty \n Danced upon the board, the companion of poor couches. \n And Diphilus says\u2014 \n There is no business more mischievous or degrading \n Than that of the pander. \n I would rather walk along the streets selling \n Roses, and radishes, and lupin-beans, and press'd olives, \n And anything else in the world, rather than give encouragement \n To such a miserable trade. \n And you may observe, that he then uses the expression \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, lupin-beans, as they are called even now.\n Polemo says, that the Laced\u00e6monians call lupins \u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u0390\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. And Theophrastus, in his book about The Causes of\n Plants, tells us that the lupin, and the bitter vetch, and the common vetch, are\n the only kinds of green vegetable which do not produce animal life, because of\n their harshness and bitterness. But the vetch, says he, turns black as it decays.\n He says, also, that caterpillars come in vetches, and it is in the fourth book of\n the same treatise that he states this. Diphilus the Siphnian writer says that\n lupins are very apt to create moisture, and are very nutritious, especially those\n kinds Which are rendered sweet by being soaked. On which account Zeno the Citi\u00e6an,\n a man of harsh disposition and very apt to get in a passion with his friends, when\n he had taken a good deal of wine, became sweet-tempered and gentle; and when\n people asked him what produced this difference in his disposition, he said, that\n he was subject to the same influences as lupins: for that they before they were\n cooked were very bitter; but that when they had been steeped in liquor they were\n sweet and wholesome. \n ","45":"\n With respect to Kidney Beans.\u2014The Laced\u00e6monians in those suppers of theirs, which\n they call \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, give as sweetmeats, dry figs\n and beans, and green kidney beans. At least this is the statement of Polemo; and\n Epicharmus says\u2014 \n Roast some kidney beans quickly, for Bacchus is fond of them. \n And Demetrius says\u2014 \n A fig, or kidney bean, or some such thing. \n \n \n \n ","46":"\n With respect to Olives. Eupolis says\u2014 \n Cuttle-fish, and olives fallen from the tree. \n And these the Romans call drypt\u00e6. But Diphilus the Siphnian writer says\n that olives contain very little nourishment, and are apt to give headaches; and\n that the black ones are still worse for the stomach, and make the head feel heavy;\n but that those which we call \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, that is\n to say, preserved in pickle, are better for the stomach, and give strength to the\n bowels. But that the black when crushed are better for the stomach. Aristophanes\n too makes mention of crushed olives in The Islands, saying\u2014 \n Bring some crushed olives; \n and in another place he says\u2014 \n Crush'd olives and pickled olives are not the same thing; \n and a few lines after\u2014 \n For it is better that they should be crush'd than pickled. \n And Archestratus says, in his Gastronomy\u2014 \n Let wrinkled olives, fallen from the tree, \n Be placed before you. \n And Hermippus says\u2014 \n Be sure that for the future you remember \n The ever-glorious Marathon for good, \n When you do all from time to time add \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd (that is to say, fennel) to your pickled olives. \n And Philemon says\u2014 The inferior olives are called \u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, and the dark-coloured are called \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n And Callimachus, in his Hecale, gives a regular catalogue\n of the different kinds of olive\u2014 \n \n \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, and the white olive, which does not \n Become ripe till autumn, which is to float in wine. \n And according to Didymus, they called both olives and figs which had\n fallen to the ground of their own accord, \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9. Besides, without mentioning the name\n olive, the fruit itself was called by that name \u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2, without any explanatory addition. Teleclides\n says\u2014 \n He urged me to remain, and eat with him \n Some \u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2, and some maize, and have a\n chat with him. \n But the Athenians called bruised olives \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1 ; and what we call \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1 \n they called \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b1, that is to say, the dregs of the grapes after they have been pressed. And the word\n \u03b2\u03c1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2, a bunch of grapes. \n ","47":"\n With respect to Radishes.\u2014The Greek name \u1fe5\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \n is derived from \u1fe5\u1fb3\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, because they\n quickly appear above ground; and in the plural the Attic writers either shorten or\n lengthen the penultima at pleasure. Cratinus writes\u2014 \n \n \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1fe5\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6, it is like radishes,\n but not like other vegetables; \n and Eupolis, on the other hand, says\u2014 \n \n \u02bd\u1fe5\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f04\u03c0\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, unwashed radishes and\n cuttle-fish. \n For the word \u1f04\u03c0\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, unwashed, must\n clearly refer to the radishes, and not to the cuttle-fish; as is shown by\n Antiphanes, in whom we find these lines:\u2014 \n To eat ducks, and honeycombs of wild bees, and eggs, \n And cheese-cakes, and unwash'd radishes, \n And rape, and oatmeal-groats, and honey. \n So that radishes appear to have been particularly called un- washed\n radishes; being probably the same as those called Thasian. Pherecrates says\u2014\n \n There one may have the unwash'd radish, and the warm \n Bath, and closely stewed pickles, and nuts. \n And Plato, in his Hyperbolus, says, using the diminutive termination,\n \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f24 \u1fe5\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \n a leaflet, or a little radish. But Theophrastes, in his book on\n Plants, says that there are five kinds of radishes: the Corinthian, the\n Leiothasian, the Cleon\u00e6an, the Amorean, and the B\u0153otian; and that the B\u0153otian,\n which is of a round form, is the sweetest. And he says that, as a general rule,\n those the leaves of which are smooth, are the sweetest. But Callias used the form\n \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 for \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 ; at all events, when discussing the antiquity of comedy, he\n says, Broth, and sausages, and radishes ( \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ), and fallen olives, and cheese-cakes. And indeed\n that he meant the same as what we call \u1fe5\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n is plainly sown by Aristophanes, who in the Dana\u00efdes alludes to such old forms,\n and says\u2014 \n And then the chorus used to dance, \n Clad in worsted-work and fine clothes; \n And bearing under their arms ribs of beef, \n And sausages, and radishes. \n And the radish is a very economical kind of food. Amphis says\u2014 \n \n Whoever, when purchasing food, \n When it is in his power, O Apollo, to buy genuine fish, \n Prefers buying radishes, is downright mad! \n \n \n ","48":"\n With respect to Pine-cones.\u2014Mnesitheus, the Athenian physician, in his book on\n Comestibles, calls the husks of the pine-cones \u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, and in another place he calls them \u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9. But Diocles of Carystus calls them \u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03cb\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1, \n nuts of \n the pine-tree. And Alexander the Myndian calls them\n \u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u0390\u03bd\u1f78\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. And Theophrastus calls the\n tree \u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7, and the fruit \u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. But Hippocrates, in his book on Barley-water,\u2014 (one half of\n which is considered spurious by everybody, and some people reckon the whole\n so,)\u2014calls the fruit \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ; but most people\n call it \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 : as Herodotus does, in speaking of\n the Pontic nut. For he says, And this has \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1 ( a kernel), when it becomes\n ripe. But Diphilus the Siphnian says, Pine-cones (which\n he calls \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \n are very nutritious, and have a tendency to soften the arteries, and to\n relieve the chest, because they have some resinous qualities contained in\n them. While Mnesitheus says that they fill the body with fat, and are\n very free from all hindrances to the digestion; and, moreover, that they are\n diuretic, and that they are free from all astringent tendencies. \n ","49":"\n Now with respect to Eggs.\u2014Anaxagoras, in his book on Natural Philosophy, says that\n what is called the milk of the bird is the white which is in the eggs. And\n Aristophanes says\u2014 In the first instance, night brings forth a wind egg. Sappho\n dissolves the word \u1f66\u03bf\u03bd into a trisyllable, making\n it \u1f64\u03ca\u03bf\u03bd, when she says\u2014 \n They say that formerly Leda found an egg. \n And again she says\u2014 \n Far whiter than an egg: \n in each case writing \u1f64\u03ca\u03bf\u03bd. But Epicharmus\n spelt the word \u1f64\u03b5\u03b1 ; for so we find the line\n written\u2014 \n The eggs of geese and other poultry. \n And Simonides, in the second book of his Iambics, says\u2014 \n Like the egg of a M\u00e6andrian goose; \n which he, too, writes \u1f64\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd . But\n Alexandrides lengthens the word into a quadrisyllable, and calls it \u1f60\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. And so does Ephippus, when he says\u2014 \n \n And little casks of good wine made of palms, \n And eggs, and all other trifles of that kind. \n And Alexis, somewhere or other, uses the expressidn, hemispheres\n of eggs. And wind eggs they called \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1, and also \u1f51\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03ad\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 . They\n called also the upper chambers of houses which we now call \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f66\u03bf\u03bd ; and accordingly Clearchus says, in his\n Erotics, that Helen, from having been born and brought up in a\n chamber of this sort, got the character, with a great many people, of having been\n born of an egg ( \u1f60\u03bf\u1fe6 ). And it was an ignorant\n statement of Neocles of Crotona, that the egg fell from the moon, from which Helen\n was born: for that women under the influence of the moon bring forth eggs, and\n that those who are born from such eggs are fifteen times as large as we are: as\n Herodotus of Heraclea also asserts. And Ibycus, in the fifth book of his Melodies,\n says of the Molionid\u0153\u2014 \n And they slew the two young Molions, youths alike in face, \n Borne on white horses; of the same age; and \n Alike, too, in all their limbs, for both were born \n On one day, from one single silver egg. \n And Ephippus says\u2014 \n Cakes made of sesame and honey, sweetmeats, \n Cheese-cakes, and cream-cakes, and a hecatomb \n Of new-laid eggs, were all devour'd by us. \n And Nicomachus makes mention of such eggs\u2014 \n For when my father had left me a very little property, \n I scraped it so, and got the kernel out of it \n In a few months, as if I had been a boy sucking an egg. \n And Eriphus makes mention of goose's eggs\u2014 \n Just see how white and how large these eggs are; \n These must be goose eggs, as far as I can see. \n And he says, that it was eggs like this which were laid by Leda. But\n Ep\u00e6netus and Heraclides the Syracusan, in their book on Cookery, say that the best\n of all eggs are peacock's eggs; and that the next best are those of the foxgoose;\n and the third best are those of common poultry. \n ","50":"\n Now let us speak of provocatives to appetite, called \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 .\u2014When they were brought round by the butler, Ulpian said,\n Does the word \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 occur in any\n ancient author in the sense in which we use it now? and when every one\n joined in the question, I will tell you, said Athen\u00e6us;\n Phylarchus the Athenian, (though some called him a\n native of Naucratis,) in the book where he speaks of Zelas the king of the\n Bithynians, who invited to supper all the leaders of the Galatians, and then\n plotted against them, and was killed himself also, says, if I recollect his\n words rightly, 'A certain \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 was brought\n round before supper, as was the custom of antiquity.' And when Ulpian\n had said this, he asked for something to drink from the wine-cooler, saying, that\n he was in good humour with himself for having been able to remember this so very\n \u00e0 propos. But there were things of all sorts, says\n Athen\u00e6us, used in these \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n \n ","51":"\n With respect to Mallows, Hesiod says\u2014 \n Nor do men know how great may be the good \n Derived from asphodel and mallow food. \n \n \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7 is the Attic name for mallow. But I, says\n Atheneus, have found in many of the copies of the Minos of Antiphanes the word\n spelt with an o; for instance, he speaks of men\u2014 \n Eating the root of mallow ( \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n And Epicharmus has\u2014 \n I am milder than the mallow ( \u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n And Phanias says, in his book on Plants\u2014 The seminal portions of\n the cultivated mallow are called 'the cheese-cake,' as being like a\n cheese-cake. For those pistils which are like the teeth of a comb have some\n resemblance to the edge of a cheese-cake; and there is a boss like centre, like\n that in the middle of a cheese-cake. And the whole circumference of the rim is\n like the sea-fish denominated the sea-urchin. But Diphilus the Siphnian\n makes a statement, that the mallow is full of pleasant and wholesome juice; having\n a tendency to smooth the arteries, separating from them the harshnesses of the\n blood by bringing them to the surface. And he adds that the mallow is of great\n service in irritations of the kidneys and the bladder, and that it is very\n tolerably digestible and nutritious. And moreover, that the wild mallow is\n superior to that which grows in a garden. But Hermippus, the follower of\n Callimachus, in his treatise on the Seven Wise Men, says that mallows are put in\n what he calls the \u1f04\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, that is to say, the\n preventive against hunger, and into the \u1f04\u03b4\u03b9\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd, \n that is, the preventive against thirst; and that it is a very useful ingredient in\n both. \n ","52":"\n The next thing to be mentioned are Gourds.\u2014Euthy- demus, the\n Athenian, in his book on Vegetables, calls the long gourd, known as \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7, the Indian gourd; and it is called Indian\n because the seed was originally introduced from India. But the people of\n Megalopolis call the same the Sicyonian gourd. Theophrastus however says, that of\n the kind called \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7, there is not one\n species or genus only, but several, some better, some worse. While Meodorus, the\n follower of Erasistratus, the friend of Icesius, says, Of the long gourds\n there is the Indian, which is the same which we call \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1, and which is vulgarly called the \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7. Now the Indian gourd is usually boiled, but that\n called \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7 is usually roasted. \n And even to the present day the \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 are\n called by the Cnidians Indian gourds; while the people of the Hellespont call the\n long gourds \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9, and the round gourds \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. But Diocles states that the best round\n gourds are those grown near Magnesia; and, moreover, that the rape grown in that\n district runs to an exceedingly large size, and is sweet, and good for the\n stomach. He says, at the same time, that the best cucumbers are grown at Antioch,\n the best lettuce at Smyrna and Galatea, and the best rue at Myra. Diphilus says,\n \"The gourd is far from nutritious, easily digested, apt to produce moisture in the\n skin, promotes the secretions of the body, and is full of agreeable and wholesome\n juice; but it is still more juicy when cooked. Its alterative qualities are\n increased when it is eaten with mustard, but it is more digestible, and it\n promotes the secretions more, when boiled. \n Mnesitheus too says, \"All the vegetables and fruits which are easily affected by\n the action of fire, such as the cucumber, and the gourd, and the quince, and the\n small quince, and everything else of the same sort, when they are eaten after\n having been roasted, afford nutriment to the body, in no great quantity indeed,\n but still such as is pleasant and promotes moisture. However all these vegetables\n and fruits have a tendency to produce constipation, and they ought to be eaten\n boiled rather than raw. But the Attic writers call the gourd by no other name but\n \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7. Hermippus says\u2014 \n What a huge head he has; it is as big as a gourd! \n And Phrynichus, using the diminutive, says\u2014 \n Will you have a little maize ( \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) or\n gourd ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd )? \n \n And Epicharmus says\u2014 \n That is much more wholesome than a gourd ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7 ). \n \n \n ","53":"\n And Epicrates the comic poet writes\u2014 \n \n \n A.

Indeed, I can inform you most exactly. \n For at the great Panathenaic feast, \n I saw a company of youths assembled \n Within the schools of the old Academy, \n And heard some strange and marvellous assertions. \n For they were nature's mysteries discussing, \n Drawing distinctions subtle 'tween the life \n Of animated things, both men and beasts, \n And that of trees and all the race of herbs. \n And then, while occupied in these discussions \n They turned to gourds their deep investigations, \n Asking their species and their character. \n \n A. And to what sage conclusion did they come? \n What was their definition, of what genus \n Did they decide this plant to be, my friend? \n I pray you tell 'em, if you know at least. \n \n B. At first they all stood silent for a while, \n And gazed upon the ground and knit their brows \n In profound solemn meditation: \n Then on a sudden, while the assembled youths \n Were stooping still considering the matter, \n One said a gourd was a round vegetable; \n But others said it was a kind of grass; \n While others class'd it as a sort of tree. \n On hearing this, a certain old physician \n Coming from Sicily interrupted them \n As but a pack of triflers. They were furious, \n Greatly enraged, and all most loudly cried \n With one accord, that he insulted them; \n For that such sudden interruptions \n To philosophical discussion \n Were ill-bred and extremely unbecoming. \n And then the youths thought no more of the gourd. \n But Plato, who was present, mildly said, \n Not being at all excited by what pass'd, \n That the best thing that they could do would be \n The question to resume of the gourd's nature. \n They would not hear him, and adjourn'd the meeting. \n \n \n ","54":"\n Alexis, that most witty poet, sets an entire course of \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 before those who can understand him\u2014 \n \n I came without perceiving it on a place \n Which was exceedingly convenient. \n Water was given me; and then a servant \n Entered, and bore a table for my use; \n On which was laid, not cheese, or tawny olives, \n Or any dainty side-dishes and nonsense, \n Which fill the room with scent, but have no substance; \n But there was set before me a huge dish \n Redolent of the Seasons and the joyful Hours\u2014 \n A sort of hemisphere of the whole globe. \n Everything there was beautiful and good: \n Fish, goats' flesh, and a scorpion between them; \n Then there were eggs in half, looking like stars. \n On them we quickly laid our hands, and then \n Speaking to me, and giving me a nod, \n The host began to follow our example; \n So we'd a race, and never did I stop \n Till the whole dish was empty as a sieve. \n \n ","55":"\n With respect to Mushrooms.\u2014Aristias says\u2014 \n The stony soil produced no mushrooms. \n And Poliochus has the following passage\u2014 \n Each of us twice a day received to eat \n Some small dark maize well winnow'd from the chaff, \n And carefully ground; and also some small figs. \n Meantime some of the party would begin \n And roast some mushrooms; and perhaps would catch \n Some delicate snails if 'twas a dewy morning, \n And vegetables which spontaneous grew. \n Then, too, we'd pounded olives; also wine \n Of no great strength, and no very famous vintage. \n And Antiphanes says\u2014 \n Our supper is but maize well fenced round \n With chaff, so as not to o'erstep the bounds \n Of well-devised economy.

But there are not many sorts of them\n which are good to eat; for the greater part of them produce a sensation of\n choking: on which account Epicharmus, when jesting, said\u2014 \n You will be choked, like those who waste away \n By eating mushrooms, very heating food. \n And Nicander, in his Georgics, gives a list of which species are\n poisonous; and says\u2014 \n Terrible evils oftentimes arise \n From eating olives, or pomegranates, or from the trees \n Of maple, or of oak; but worst of all \n Are the swelling sticky lumps of mushrooms. \n And he says in another place\u2014 \n Bury a fig-tree trunk deep in the ground, \n Then cover it with dung, and moisten it \n With water from an ever flowing brook, \n Then there will grow at bottom harmless mushrooms; \n Select of them what's good for food, and not \n Deserving of contempt, and cut the root off. \n But all the rest of that passage is in a mutilated state.

And Speusippus, in the second book of his\n treatise on Things Similar, says that its leaf resembles the marsh parsley; on\n which account Ptolemy the Second, surnamed Euergetes, who was king of Egypt,\n insists upon it that the line in Homer ought to be written thus\u2014 \n And around were soft meadows of sium or parsley; \n for that it is \u03c3\u03af\u03b1 which are usually\n found in company with parsley, and not \u1f34\u03b1 ( violets ). \n ","58":"\n Diphilus says that mushrooms are good for the stomach, and pass easily through the\n bowels, and are very nutritious, but still that they are not very digestible, and\n that they are apt to produce flatulence. And that especially those from the island\n of Ceos have this character. \"Many are even poisonous to a fatal degree. But those\n which seem to be wholesome are those with the smoothest rinds, which are tender\n and easily crushed: such as grow close to elms and pine-trees. But those which are\n unwholesome are of a dark colour, or livid, or covered with hard coats; and those\n too which get hard after being boiled and placed on the table; for such are deadly\n to eat. But the best remedy for them when eaten unawares is drinking honey-water,\n and fresh mead, and vinegar. And after such a drink the patient should vomit. On\n which account, too, it is especially desirable to dress mushrooms with vinegar, or\n honey and vinegar, or honey, or salt: for by these means their choking properties\n are taken away. But Theophrastus, in his treatise about Plants, writes thus\u2014\n But plants of this kind grow both under the ground and on the ground,\n like those things which some people call fungi, which grow in company with\n mushrooms; for they too grow without having any roots; but the real mushrooms\n have, as the beginning by which they adhere to the ground, a stalk of some\n length, and they put forth fibres from that stalk. He says also that in the sea which is around the Pillars of Her-\n cules, when there is a high tide, mushrooms grow on the shore close to high-water\n mark, which they say are left there by the sun. And Ph\u00e6nias says, in his first\n book about Plants \u2014 But these things neither put forth any bloom, nor any\n trace of seminal germination; as, for instance, the mushroom, the truffle,\n groundivy, and fern. And in another place he says, \n \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 ( fern ), which\n some people call \u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd . But\n Theophrastus, in his book on Plants, says\u2014 Plants with smooth rinds, as the\n truffle, the mushroom, the fungus, the geranium. \n \n ","59":"\n Now with respect to Truffles.\u2014They too spring of their own accord out of the\n ground; especially in sandy places. And Theophrastus says of them\u2014 The\n truffle, which some people call the geranium, and all other such plants which\n grow beneath the earth. And in another place he says- \"The generation\n and production of these things which seed beneath the earth; as, for instance, of\n the truffle, and of a plant which grows around Cyrene, which they call misy. And it appears to be exceedingly sweet, and to have a\n smell like that of meat; and so, too, has a plant called itum, which grows in Thrace. And a peculiarity is mentioned as incidental\n to these things; for men say that they appear when there is heavy rain in autumn\n and violent thunder; especially when there is thunder, as that is a more\n stimulating cause of them: however, they do not last more than a year, as they are\n only annuals; they are in the greatest perfection in the spring, when they are\n most plentiful. Not but what there are people who believe that they are or can be\n raised from seed. At all events, they say that they never appeared on the shore of\n the Mitylen\u00e6ans, until after a heavy shower some seed was brought from Tiar\u00e6; and\n that is the place where they are in the greatest numbers. But they are principally\n found on the sea-shore, and wherever the ground is sandy; and that is the\n character of the place called Tiar\u00e6. They are also found near Lampsacus, and also\n in Acarnania, and Alopeconnesus, and in the district of the Eleans. Lynceus the\n Samian says\u2014 The sea produces nettles, and the land produces\n truffles; and Matron, the man who wrote parodies, says in his\n Supper \u2014 \n And he brought oysters, the truffles of Thetis the Nereid. \n \n Diphilus says that truffles are by nature indigestible, but\n that they are full of wholesome juice, and have lenitive qualities, and are very\n easily evacuated; though, like mushrooms, some of them are apt to produce\n suffocation. And Hegesander the Delphian says that no truffles are found in the\n Hellespont, and no fish of the kind called \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, and no thyme. On which account Nausiclides said of the\n country, that it had no spring and no friends. But Pamphils says, in his\n Languages, that there is a plant called \u1f51\u03b4\u03bd\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, being a species of grass which grows on the top of the\n truffles, by which the truffle is discovered. \n ","60":"\n With respect to Nettles\u2014 \u02bc\u1f00\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c6\u03b7 is the name given\n by the Attic writers to a plant which is herbaceous and which produces itching.\n Aristophanes says, in his Ph\u0153niss\u00e6, that pot-herbs were the first things\n which grew out of the earth; and after them the rough stinging-nettles. \n \n ","61":"\n The next thing to be considered is Asparagus\u2014which is divided into mountain\n asparagus and marsh asparagus; the best kinds of which are not raised from seed;\n but they are remedies for every kind of internal disorder. But those which are\n raised from seed grow to an immense size. And they say that in Libya, among the\n G\u00e6tuli, they grow of the thickness of a Cyprian reed, and twelve feet long; but\n that on the mountain land and on land near the sea they grow to the thickness of\n large canes, and twenty cubits long. But Cratinus writes the word, not \u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, but \u1f00\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, with a \u03c6 .

But it is the Athenians who\n give it the name of bursting; and they also give the flowering cabbage, or\n cauliflower, the same name. Sophocles says, in The Huntsmen\u2014 \n Then it puts forth a stalk, and never ceases \n The germnination; \n \n because it is continually bursting out and putting forth\n shoots. However, Antiphanes always spells the word \u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, with a \u03c0 ; and he writes\n thus\u2014 \n The asparagus was shining; the pale vetches had faded. \n And Aristophon says\u2014 Capers, pennyroyal, thyme, asparagus, garlic,\n radishes, sage, and rue. \n \n ","62":"\n With respect to Snails.\u2014Philyllius says\u2014 \n I am not a grasshopper, nor a snail, O woman. \n And in a subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n Sprats, tunny fish, and snails, and periwinkles. \n And Hesiod calls the snail, \n The hero that carries his house on his back. \n And Anaxilas says\u2014 \n You are e'en more distrustful than a snail; \n Who fears to leave even his house behind him. \n And Ach\u00e6us speaks of them, and says\u2014 \n Can such a vapour strange produce \n The snails, those horned monsters? \n And an enigma, like a fishing-net, having reference to the snail, is\n often proposed at banquets, in these terms\u2014 \n What is that spineless bloodless beast of the woods, \n Who makes his path amid the humid waters. \n And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals,\n says\u2014 Snails appear to become pregnant in the autumn and in spring, and\n they are the only animals with coverings of shells that have ever been detected\n in union. But Theophrastus says, in his treatise about Animals which\n live in Holes\u2014 Snails live in holes during the winter, and still more in the\n summer, on which account they are seen in the greatest numbers during the\n autumn rains. But their holes in the summer are made upon the ground, and in\n the trees. There are some snails which are called \u03c3\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9. Epicharmus says\u2014 \n Instead of all these animals, they have locusts; \n But I hate above all things the shell of the sesilus. \n And Apellas relates that the Laced\u00e6monians call the snail \u03c3\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. But Apollodorus, in the second book of his\n Etymologies, says that there are some snails which are called \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, \n interrupters of banquets. \n \n ","63":"\n The next vegetable to be mentioned is Onions.\u2014In the Amalthea\n of Eubulus, Hercules is represented as refusing to eat them; saying\u2014 \n Whether it's hot, or whether it is dry, \n Or whether it is something 'tween the two, \n Are points of more importance than old Troy. \n But I have not come here to fill myself \n With cabbages, or benjamin, or other \n Impious and bitter danties, or with onions. \n But that which tends the most to vigorous strength \n And health is food which I delight in chiefly. \n Meat of beef, boil'd and fresh, and plenty of it, \n And a large well-filled dish of oxen's feet, \n Three roasting pigs besides, sprinkled with salt. \n Alexis, while explaining the efficacy of onions in aphrodisiac matters,\n says\u2014 \n Pinnas, beetles, snails, muscles, eggs, calves'-feet, \n And many other philters, may be found \n More useful still to one who loves his mistress. \n Xenarchus, in the Butalion, says\u2014 \n A house is ruined which has a master \n Whose fortune's gone, and whom the evil genius \n Has struck. And so the once great house of the Pelops \n Is weak and nerveless.

And Diphilus says\u2014\"Onions are\n difficult to digest, but very nutritious, and good for the stomach. And, moreover,\n they are productive of moisture, and cleansing, but they dim the eyes, and excite\n the amatory propensities. But the proverb says\u2014 \n The onion will do you no good if you have no strength yourself. \n \n But those onions which are called the royal onions, really do stimulate the amatory propensities, for they are\n superior to the other kinds; and next to them are the red ones.

Yet they are very\n tolerably wholesome, because they have a good deal of harshness in them, and\n because they promote the secretions. And Matron, in his Parodies, mentions the\n \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u2014 \n But sowthistles I will not even name, \n Plants full of'marrow, crown'd on th' heads with thorns; \n Nor the white onions, minstrels of great Jove, \n Which his dear Child, incessant rain, has nourish'd \n Whiter than snow storms, and like meal to view, \n Which, when they first appeared, my stomach loved. \n \n \n ","66":"\n Nicander extols the onions of Megara. But Theophrastus, in the seventh book of his\n treatise on Plants, says\u2014 In some places the onions are so sweet, that they\n are eaten raw, as they are in the Tauric Chersonesus. And Ph\u00e6nias makes\n the same statement:\u2014 There is, says he, a kind of onion which\n bears wool, according to Theophrastus; and it is produced on the sea-shore. And\n it has the wool underneath its first coat, so as to be between the outer\n eatable parts and the inner ones. And from this wool socks and stockings and\n other articles of clothing are woven. And Ph\u0153nias himself adopts the\n statement. But the onion, he continues, of the Indians is\n hairy. But concerning the dressing of onions, Philemon says\u2014 \n Now if you want an onion, just consider \n What great expense it takes to make it good: \n You must have cheese, and honey, and sesame, \n Oil, leeks, and vinegar, and assaf\u0153tida, \n To dress it up with; for by itself the onion \n Is bitter and unpleasant to the taste. \n But Heraclides the Tarentine, limiting the use of onions at banquets,\n says\u2014 One must set bounds to much eating, especially of such things as\n have anything glutinous or sticky about them; as, for instance, eggs, onions,\n calves' feet, snails, and such things as those: for they remain in the stomach\n a long time, and form a lump there, and check their\n natural moisture. \n \n ","67":"\n Thrushes, too, and crowds of other birds, formed part of the dishes in the\n propomata.

But Aristotle asserts that there are three kinds of thrushes; the first and\n largest kind of which is nearly equal to a jay; and they call it also the ixophagus, since it eats the mistletoe. The next kind is\n like a blackbird in size, and they call them trichades. \n The third kind is less than either of the before-mentioned sorts, and is called\n illas, but some call it tylas, \n as Alexander the Myndian does.

And\n they said, that at all events none of the ancients had ever eaten them, because\n they were the seat of nearly all sensation. But Apollodorus the Athenian says,\n that none of the ancients ever even named the brain. And at all events Sophocles,\n in his Trachini\u00e6, where he represents Hercules as throwing Lichas into the sea,\n does not use the word \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \n brains, but says \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd\n \u03bc\u03c5\u03b5\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2, white marrow; avoiding a word which it was thought ill-omened\n to use:\u2014 \n \n And from his hair he forces the white marrow, \n His head being burst asunder in the middle, \n And the blood flows: \n though he had named all the rest of his limbs plainly enough. And\n Euripides, introducing Hecuba lamenting for Astyanax, who had been thrown down by\n the Greeks, says\u2014 \n Unhappy child, how miserably have \n Your native city's walls produced your death, \n And dash'd your head in pieces! Fatal towers, \n Which Ph\u00e6bus builded! How did your mother oft \n Cherish those curly locks, and press upon them \n With never-wearied kisses! now the blood \n Wells from that wound, where the bones broken gape; \n But some things are too horrid to be spoken. \n The lines too which follow these are worth stopping to consider. But\n Philocles does employ the word \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u2014 \n He never ceased devouring even the brains ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Aristophanes says\u2014 \n I would be content \n To lose two membranes of the \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n And others, too, use the word. So that it must have been for the sake of\n the poetical expression that Sophocles said white marrow. But\n Euripides not choosing openly to display to sight an unseemly and disgusting\n object, revealed as much as he chose. And they thought the head sacred, as is\n plain by their swearing by it; and by their even venerating sneezes, which proceed\n from the head, as holy. And we, to this day, confirm our arrangements and promises\n by nodding the head. As the Jupiter of Homer says\u2014 \n \n Come now, and I will nod my head to you. \n \n ","72":"\n Now all these things were put into the dishes which were served up as propomata:\n pepper, green leaved myrrh, galingal, Egyptian ointment. Antiphanes says\u2014 \n If any one buys pepper and brings it home, \n They torture him by law like any spy. \n And in a subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n Now is the time for a man to go and find pepper, \n And seed of orach, and fruit, and buy it, and bring it here. \n And Eubulus says\u2014 \n Just take some Cnidian grains, or else some pepper, \n And pound them up with myrrh, and strew around. \n And Ophelion says\u2014 \n Pepper from Libya take, and frankincense, \n And Plato's heaven-inspired book of wisdom. \n \n And Nicander says, in his Theriaca\u2014 \n Take the conyza's woolly leaves and stalks, \n And often cut new pepper up, and add \n Cardamums fresh from Media. \n And Theophrastus, in his History of Plants, says\u2014 Pepper indeed is\n a fruit: and there are two kinds of it; the one is round, like a vetch, having\n a husk, and is rather red in colour; but the other is oblong, black, and full\n of seeds like poppy-seeds. But this kind is much stronger than the other. Both\n kinds are heating, on which account they are used as remedies for, and\n antidotes against, hemlock. And in his treatise on Suffocation, he\n writes\u2014 And people who are suffocated are recovered by an infusion of\n vinegar and pepper, or else by the fruit of the nettle when crushed. \n But we must recollect that, properly speaking, there is no noun of the neuter\n gender among the Greeks ending in \u03b9, except\n \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 alone; for the words \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9, and \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bc\u03b9, and \u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c6\u03b9 are foreign. \n ","73":"\n Let us now speak of oil\u2014Antiphanes or Alexis makes mention of the Samian Oil,\n saying\u2014 \n This man you see will be a measurer \n Of that most white of oils, the Samian oil. \n Ophelion makes mention also of Carian oil, and says\u2014 \n The man anointed was with Carian oil. \n Amyntas, in his treatise on Persian Weights and Measures, Says\u2014\"The\n mountains there bear turpentine and mastic trees, and Persian nuts, from which\n they make a great deal of oil for the king. And Ctesias says, that in Carmania\n there is made an oil which is extracted from thorns, which the king uses. And he,\n in his third book of his treatise on the Revenues derived from Asia, making a list\n of all the things which are prepared for the king for his supper, makes no mention\n of pepper, or of vinegar, which of itself is the very best of all seasonings. Nor\n does Deinon, in his Persian History; though he does say that ammoniac salt is sent\n up to the king from Egypt, and water from the Nile. Theophrastus also mentions an\n oil which he calls \u1f60\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1f72\u03c2, that is to say, extracted raw, in his treatise on Scents, saying that it is\n produced from the large coarse olives called phaulian, and\n from almonds. Amphis also speaks of the oil which is produced amongst the\n Thurians, as exceedingly fine\u2014 \n Oil from the Thurians comes; from Gela lentils. \n \n \n \n ","74":"\n Pickle is a thing often mentioned. Cratinus Says\u2014 \n Your basket will be full of briny pickle. \n And Pherecrates says\u2014 \n His beard was all besmear'd with pickle juice. \n And Sophocles, in his Triptolemus, says\u2014 \n Eating this briny season'd pickle. \n And Plato the comic writer says\u2014 \n These men will choke me, steeping me in putrid pickle. \n But the word \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \n pickle, is a masculine noun. As Aeschylus proves, when he\n says \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n ","75":"\n Vinegar too was much used by the ancients, and this is the only seasoning to which\n the Attics give the name of \u1f27\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, as if it were\n akin to \u1f21\u03b4\u1f7a\u03c2, \n sweet. And Chrysippus the philosopher says, that the best\n vinegar is the Egyptian and the Cnidian. But Aristophanes, in his Plutus, says\u2014\n \n Sprinkling it o'er with Sphettian vinegar. \n Didymus explaining this verse says, Perhaps he says Sphettian\n because the Sphettians are sour-tempered people. And somewhere or other\n he mentions vinegar from Cleon\u00e6, as being most excellent, saying, And at\n Cleon\u00e6 there are manufactories of vinegar. We find also in Diphilus\u2014\n \n \n A. He first takes off his coat, and then he\n sups, \n After what fashion think you? \n \n B. Why, like a Spartan. \n \n A. A measure then of vinegar . . . . \n \n B. Bah! \n \n A. Why bah \n \n B. A measure holds but such and such a quantity \n Of the best Cleon\u00e6an vinegar. \n And Philonides says\u2014 \n Their seasonings have not vinegar sufficient. \n But Heraclides the Tarentine, in his Symposium, says, Vinegar has\n a tendency to make the exterior parts coagulate, and it affects the strings\n within the stomach in a very similar manner; but any parts which are tumid it\n dissolves, because forsooth different humours are mixed up in us. And\n Alexis used to admire above all others the Decelean vinegar, and says\u2014 \n You have compell'd me to bring forth from thence \n Four half-pint measures full of vinegar \n From Decelea, and now drag me through \n The middle of the forum. \n \n The word \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd must be\n spelt so, with a v, and the vessel which receives it is\n called \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd. And so Lysias, in the speech\n against Theopompus when on his trial for an assault, says, But I myself\n drink \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9. \n And so too we must call oil of roses mixed with vinegar \u1f40\u03be\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, spelling all the words thus compounded in\n this manner with a v. \n \n ","76":"\n Seasonings are mentioned even by Sophocles. In his Ph\u00e6acians we find the\n expression, \n And seasoning for food. \n And in Aeschylus too we read\u2014 \n You are steeping the seasonings. \n And Theopompus says\u2014 Many bushels of seasonings, and many sacks and\n bags of books, and of all other things which may be useful for life. In\n Sophocles too the expression is found\u2014 \n I like a cook will cleverly season . . . . \n And Cratinus says in the Glaucus\u2014 \n It is not every one who can season skilfully. \n And Eupolis speaks of \n Very bad vinegar seasoned in an expensive way. \n And Antiphanes, in his Leucas, gives the following catalogue of\n seasonings:\u2014 \n Dried grapes, and salt, and eke new wine \n Newly boiled down, and assaf\u00e6tida, \n And cheese, and thyme, and sesame, \n And nitre too, and cummin seed, \n And sumach, honey, and marjoram, \n And herbs, and vinegar and oil \n And sauce of onions, mustard and capers mix d, \n And parsley, capers too, and eggs, \n And lime, and cardamums, and th' acid juice \n Which comes from the green fig-tree, besides lard \n And eggs and honey and flour wrapp'd in fig-leaves, \n And all compounded in one savoury forcemeat. \n The ancients were well acquainted with the Ethiopian cardamum. We must\n take notice that they used the words \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 and\n \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 as masculine nouns. And so\n Anaxandrides says\u2014 \n Cutting asparagus and squills and marjoram, ( \u1f43\u03c2 ) \n Which gives the pickle an aristocratic taste, \n When duly mixed ( \u03bc\u03b9\u03c7\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 ) with coriander\n seed. \n \n And Ion says\u2014 \n But in a hurried manner in his hand \n He hides the marjoram ( \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ). \n Plato however, or Cantharus, used it as feminine, saying\u2014 \n She from Arcadia brought \n The harshly-tasted ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd )\n marjoram. \n Epicharmus and Ameipsias both use it as a neuter noun; but Nicander, in\n his Melissurgica, uses \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 as masculine. \n ","77":"\n Cratinus used the word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, which properly\n means merely full ripe, in speaking of the cucumbers which give seed, in his\n Ulysseses\u2014 \n Tell me, O wisest son of old Laertes, \n Have you e'er seen a friend of yours in Paros \n Buy a large cucumber that's run to seed? \n And Plato says in his Laius\u2014 \n Do you not see \n That Meleager, son of mighty Glaucon, \n . . . . Goes about every where like a stupid cuckoo, \n With legs like the seedless \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd \n cucumber? \n And Anaxilas says\u2014 \n His ankles swell'd \n Larger than e'en a \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd cucumber. \n And Theopompus says of a woman\u2014 \n She was to me \n More tender than a \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd cucumber. \n Ph\u00e6nias says, \"Both the \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2 and the\n \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd are tender to eat, with the stem on which\n they grow; however the seed is not to be eaten, but the outside only, when they\n are fully ripe; but the gourd called \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7, \n when raw is not eatable, but is very good either boiled or roasted. And Diodes the\n Carystian, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesome Things, says that\n of wild vegetables the following should be boiled before eating: the\n lettuce (the best kind of which is the black); the cardamum; mustard from the\n Adriatic; onions (the best kinds are the Asalonian, and that called getian);\n garlic, that other kind of garlic called physinga, the \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd cucumber, and the poppy. And a little afterwards he\n says, \"The \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd cucumber is better for the\n stomach and more digestible; though every cucumber when boiled is tender, never\n gives any pain, and is diuretic; but that kind called \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd when boiled in mead has very aperient \n qualities. And Speusippus, in his treatise on Similarities, calls the \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd by the name of \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1. But Diocles having named the \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd, does not any longer call it \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1 : and Speusippus after having named the \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1 never names the \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd. \n Diphilus says, the \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd is more full of wholesome\n juice, and moderates the humours of the body, but it is not very nutritious; it is\n easily digested, and promotes the secretions. \n ","78":"\n The lettuce was in great request as an article of food. Its name is \u03b8\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, but the Attics call it \u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7. Epicharmus says\u2014 \n A lettuce ( \u03b8\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b1\u03be ) with its stalk peel'd all\n the way up. \n But Strattis calls lettuces \u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n and says\u2014 \n The leek-destroying grubs, which go \n Throughout the leafy gardens \n On fifty feet, and leave their trace, \n Gnawing all herbs and vegetables; \n Leading the dances of the long-tailed satyrs \n Amid the petals of the verdant herbs, \n And of the juicy lettuces ( \u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ), \n And of the fragrant parsley. \n And Theophrastus says, Of lettuce ( \u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 ) the white is the sweeter and the more tender: there\n are three kinds; there is the lettuce with the broad stalk, and the lettuce\n with the round stalk, and in the third place there is the Laced\u00e6monian\n lettuce-its leaf is like that of a thistle, but it grows up straight and tall,\n and it never sends up any side shoots from the main stalk. But some plants of\n the broad kind are so very broad in the stalk that some people even use them\n for doors to their gardens. But when the stalks are cut, then those which shoot\n again are the sweetest of any. \n \n ","79":"\n But Nicander the Colophonian, in the second part of his Dictionary, says that the\n lettuce is called \u03b2\u03c1\u03ad\u03bd\u03b8\u03b9\u03c2 by the Cyprians. And it\n was towards a plant of this kind that Adonis was flying when he was slain by the\n boar. Amphis in his Ialemus says\u2014 \n Curse upon all these lettuces ( \u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 )! \n For if a man not threescore years should eat them, \n And then betake himself to see his mistress, \n He'll toss the whole night through, and won't be equal \n To her expectations or his own. \n And Callimachus says that Venus hid Adonis under a lettuce, which is an\n allegorical statement of the poet's, intended to show that\n those who are much addicted to the use of lettuces are very little adapted for\n pleasures of love. And Eubulus says in his Astuti\u2014 \n Do not put lettuces before me, wife, \n Upon the table; or the blame is yours. \n For once upon a time, as goes the tale, \n Venus conceal'd the sadly slain Adonis; \n Beneath the shade of this same vegetable; \n So that it is the food of dead men, or of those \n Who scarcely are superior to the dead. \n Cratinus also says that Venus when in love with Phaon hid him also in the\n leaves of the lettuce: but the younger Marsyas says that she hid him amid the\n grass of barley. \n Pamphilus in his book on Languages says, that Hipponax called the lettuce \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 : but Clitarchus says that it is the Phrygians\n who give it this name. Ibycus the Pythagorean says that the lettuce is at its\n first beginning a plant with a broad leaf, smooth, without any stalk, and is\n called by the Pythagoreans the eunuch, and by the women\n \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 ; for that it makes the men diuretic and\n powerless for the calls of love: but it is exceedingly pleasant to the taste. \n ","80":"\n Diphilus says that the stalk of the lettuce is exceedingly nutritious, and\n more difficult of digestion than the leaves; but that the leaves are more apt\n to produce flatulence, and are still more nutritious, and have a greater\n tendency to promote the secretions. And as a general rule the lettuce is good\n for the stomach, cooling and wholesome for the bowels, soporific, full of\n pleasant and wholesome juice, and certainly has a great tendency to make men\n indifferent to love. But the softer lettuce is still better for the stomach,\n and still more soporific; while that which is harder and drier is both less\n good for the stomach and less wholesome for the bowels; that, however, is also\n soporific. But the black lettuce is more cooling, and is good for the bowels;\n and summer lettuce is full of wholesome juice, and more nutritious; but that\n which is in season at the end of autumn is not nutritious, and has no juice.\n And the stalk of the lettuce appears to be a remedy against thirst. And\n the lettuce when boiled like asparagus in a dish, if we adopt the statement of\n Glaucias, is superior to all other boiled vegetables. \n Among some of the other nations Theophrastus says that \n beetroot, and lettuce, and spinach, and mustard, and sorrel, and coriander, and\n anise, and cardamums, are all called \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1, \n things fit to be sown for the second crop. And Diphilus says that, as a general\n rule, all vegetables have but little nutriment in them, and have all of them a\n tendency to make people thin, and are devoid of wholesome juices, and moreover\n stay a long while in the stomach, and are not very digestible. But Epicharmus\n speaks of some as summer vegetables. \n ","81":"\n Artichokes were often eaten. And Sophocles, in his Colchian Women, calls an\n artichoke \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, but in his Ph\u0153nix he writes the\n word \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, saying\u2014 \n The artichoke fills every field with its thorn. \n But Hecat\u00e6us the Milesian, in his Description of Asia, at least if the\n book under this title is a genuine work of that author, (for Callimachus\n attributes it to Nesiotas;) however, whoever it was who wrote the book speaks in\n these terms\u2014 Around the sea which is called the Hyrcanian sea there are\n mountains lofty and rough with woods, and on the mountains there is the prickly\n artichoke. And immediately afterwards he subjoins\u2014 Of the\n Parthian tribes the Chorasmians dwell towards the rising sun, having a\n territory partly champaign and partly mountainous. And in the mountains there\n are wild trees; the prickly artichoke, the willow, the tamarisk. He\n says moreover that the artichoke grows near the river Indus. And Scylax, or\n Polemo, writes, that that land is well watered with fountains and with\n canals, and on the mountains there grow artichokes and many other\n plants. And immediately afterwards he adds, From that point a\n mountain stretches on both sides of the river Indus, very lofty, and very\n thickly overgrown with wild wood and the prickly artichoke. \n \n But Didymus the grammarian, explaining what is meant by Sophocles when he speaks\n of the prickly artichoke (which he calls \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ),\n says, \"Perhaps he means the dog-brier, because that plant is prickly and rough;\n for the Pythian priestess did call that plant a wooden bitch. And the Locrian,\n after he had been ordered by an oracle to build a city in that place in which he\n was bitten by a wooden bitch, having had his leg scratched by a dog-brier, built\n the city in the place where the brier had stood. And there is\n a plant called the dog-brier, something between a brier and a tree, according to\n the statement of Theophrastus, and it has a red fruit, like a pomegranate, and it\n has a leaf like that of the willow. \n ","82":"\n Ph\u00e6nias, in the fifth book of his treatise on Plants, speaks of one which he calls\n the Sicilian cactus a very prickly plant. As also does Theophrastus, in his sixth\n book about Plants, who says, But the plant which is called the cactus\n exists only in Sicily, and is not found in Greece: and it sends forth stalks\n close to the ground, just above the root. And the stalks are the things which\n are called cacti: and they are eatable as soon as they are peeled, and rather\n bitter; and they preserve them in brine. But there is a second kind, which\n sends up a straight stalk, which they call \u03c0\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03be ; and that also is eatable. The shell of the fruit, as\n soon as the outer soft parts have been taken away, is like the inside of a\n date: that also is eatable; and the name of that is \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \n But who is there who would not place such belief in these assertions as\n to say confidently that this cactus is the same as that plant which is called by\n the Romans carduus, or thistle; as the Romans are at no\n great distance from Sicily, and as it is evidently the same plant which the Greeks\n call \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, or the artichoke? For if you merely\n change two letters, \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 will be the same word. \n And Epicharmus also shows us plainly this, when he puts down the cactus in his\n catalogue of eatable vegetables; in this way\u2014 The poppy, fennel, and the\n rough cactus; now one can eat of the other vegetables when dressed with milk,\n if he bruises them and serves them up with rich sauce, but by themselves they\n are not worth much. And in a subsequent passage he\n says\u2014 Lettuces, pines, squills, radishes, cacti.

And\n Xenophon, in the second book of the Anabasis, writes as follows: There,\n too, the soldiers first ate the brain of the palm or date-tree. And many of\n them marvelled at its appearance, and at the peculiarity of its delicious\n flavour. But it was found to have a great tendency to produce headache; but the\n date, when the brain was taken out of it, entirely dried up. Nicander\n says in his Georgics\u2014 \n And at the same time cutting off the branches \n Loaded with dates they bring away the brain, \n A dainty greatly fancied by the young. \n And Diphilus the Siphnian states\u2014 The brains of the dates are\n filling and nutritious; still they are heavy and not very digestible: they\n cause thirst, too, and constipation of the stomach. \n \n But we, says Athen\u00e6us, O my friend Timocrates, shall appear to keep our brains to\n the end, if we stop this conversation and the book at this point. \n ","85":"\n Some Fragments omitted in the Second Book, of the Deipnosophists of\n Athenaeus. \n Menander says\u2014 \n \n It is a troublesome thing to fall in with \n An entire party of none but relations; \n Where as soon as he has taken his cup in his hand \n The father first begins the discourse, \n And stammers out his recommendations: \n Then after him the mother, in the second place; \n And then some old aunt gossips and chatters; \n And then some harsh-voiced old man, \n The father of the aunt aforesaid; then too \n Another old woman calls him her darling: \n And he nods assent to all that is said. \n \n ","86":"\n And a little afterwards he says\u2014 \n Before the shade they wear a purple cloth, \n And then this comes after the purple; \n Being itself neither white nor purple, \n But a ray of the brilliancy of the woof as it were \n Of divers colours curiously blended. \n Antiphanes says: What do you say?

But Anaxagoras the natural philosopher says that the\n fullness of the Nile arises from the snow melting; and so, too, says Euripides, and some others of the tragic poets. And Anaxagoras\n says that this is the sole origin of all that fulness; but Euripides goes further,\n and describes the exact place where this melting of the snow takes place; for in\n his play called Archelaus he speaks thus:\u2014 \n Danaus, the noble sire of fifty daughters, \n Leaving the Nile, the fairest stream on earth, \n Fill'd by the summer of the Aethiop land, \n The negro's home, when the deep snow does melt, \n And o'er the land the Sun his chariot drives. \n And in the Helen he says something similar:\u2014 \n These are the beauticous virgin streams of Nile, \n Which in the place of rain bedew the plain \n Of Egypt when the white snow melts on th' hills. \n And Aeschylus says\u2014 \n \n I know its history, and love to praise \n The race of the Aethiop land, where mighty Nile \n Rolls down his seven streams the country through, \n When the spring winds bring down the heavy waters; \n What time the sun shining along that land \n Dissolves the mountain snow; and the whole land \n Of flourishing Egypt, fill'd with th' holy stream, \n Sends forth the vital ears of corn of Ceres. \n \n ","88":"\n And Callisthenes the historian argues against what I quoted just now as stated by\n Anaxagoras and Euripides: and he, too, declares his own opinion,\u2014that as there is\n much very heavy and continued rain in Aethiopia about the time of the rising of\n the Dogstar, and from that period till the rising of Arcturus, and as the Etesian\n winds blow at about the same time, (for these are the winds which he says have the\n greatest tendency to bring the clouds over Aethiopia,) when the clouds fall upon\n the mountains in that region, a vast quantity of water bursts forth, in\n consequence of which the Nile rises. But Democritus says that about the winter\n solstice there are heavy falls of snow in the countries around the north; but that\n when the sun changes its course, at the summer solstice, the snow being melted and\n evaporated by the warmth, clouds are formed, and then the Etesian gales catch hold\n of them, and drive them towards the south; and when these clouds are all driven\n together towards Aethiopia and Libya, a mighty rain ensues, and the water from\n that flows down the mountains and fills the Nile. This, then, is the cause which\n Democritus alleges for this fulness of the Nile. \n ","89":"\n But Euthymenes the Massiliote says, speaking of his own\n knowledge, acquired in a voyage which he had made, that the sea outside the\n Pillars of Hercules flows towards Libya and turns up and proceeds towards the\n north; and that then, being driven back by the Etesian gales, it is raised to a\n height by the winds, and flows high at that time; but, when the Etesian gales\n cease, it recedes. He says moreover, that that sea is sweet to the taste, and that\n it contains monsters like the crocodiles and the hippopotami in the Nile. \n But \u0152nopides the Chian says, that in winter the sources of the river are dried up,\n but in the summer they are thawed and flow; and so that for the sake of filling up\n the previous dryness, the rains from heaven cooperate with * * * * * * * * And on\n this account the river is smaller in winter and is full in summer. \n But Herodotus gives an explanation quite contrary to that of the rest of those who\n have discussed this subject, but agreeing with the explanation of \u0152nopides; for he\n says that the stream of the Nile is of such magnitude as always to fill the river;\n but that the sun, as it makes its journey through Libya in the winter, dries up\n the river at that time; but that as it has gone off towards the north at the time\n of the sum- mer solstice, then the river becomes full again, and overflows the\n plains. \n Now these are the mouths of the Nile:\u2014towards Arabia, the Pelusiac mouth; towards\n Libya, the Canopic: and the rest are,\u2014the Bolbitic, the Sebennytic, the Mendesian,\n the Saitic, and the Opuntic. \n "},"2":{"0":"\n CALLIMACHUS the grammarian said that a great book was equivalent to a great\n evil. \n With respect to Ciboria, or Egyptian beans, Nicander says in his Georgics\u2014 \n You may sow the Egyptian bean, in order in summer \n To make its flowers into garlands; and when the ciboria \n Have fallen, then give the ripe fruit to the youths \n Who are feasting with you, into their hands, as they have been a long\n time \n Wishing for them; but roots I boil, and then place on the table at\n feasts. \n \n But when Nicander speaks of roots, he means\n the things which are called by the Alexandrians colocasia; \n as he says elsewhere\u2014 \n Have peel'd the beans, and cut up the colocasia. \n Now there is at Sicyon a temple to the Colocasian Minerva. There is also\n a kind of cup called \u03ba\u03b9\u03b2\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n \n ","1":"\n Theophrastus, in his book on Plants, writes thus: \"The bean in Egypt grows in\n marshes and swamps; and its stalk is in length, when it is at the largest, about\n four cubits; but in thickness, it is as thick as one's finger: and it is like a\n long reed, only without joints. But it has divisions within, running through the\n whole of it, like honeycombs. And on this stalk is the head and the flower, being\n about twice the size of a poppy; and its colour is like that of a rose, very full\n coloured; and it puts forth large leaves. But the root is thicker than the\n thickest reed, and it has divisions like the stalk. And people eat it boiled, and\n roasted, and raw. And the men who live near the marshes eat it very much. It\n grows, too, in Syria and in Cilicia, but those countries do not ripen it\n thoroughly. It grows, too, around Torone in Chalcidice, in a marsh of moderate\n size, and that place ripens it, and it brings its fruit to perfection there. But\n Diphilus the Siphnian says, \"The root of the Egyptian bean, which is called\n colocasium, is very good for the stomach, and very nutritious, but it is not very\n digestible, being very astringent; and that is the best which is the least woolly.\n But the beans which are produced by the plant called ciborium, when they are green are indigestible, not very nutritious,\n easily pass through one, and are apt to cause flatulence; but when they are dry\n they are, not so flatulent. And from the genuine ciborium there is a flower which\n grows which is made into garlands. And the Egyptians call the flower the lotus;\n but the Naucratitans tell me, says Athen\u00e6us, that its name is the melilotus: and\n it is of that flower that the melilotus garlands are made, which are very\n fragrant, and which have a cooling effect in the summer season. \n ","2":"\n But Phylarchus says, \"that though Egyptian beans had never been sown before in any\n place, and had never produced fruit if any one had by chance\n sown a few, except in Egypt, still, in the time of Alexander the king, the son of\n Pyrrhus, it happened that some sprung up near the river Thyamis in Thesprotia in\n Epirus, in a certain marsh in that district; and for two years continuously they\n bore fruit and grew; and that on this Alexander put a guard over them, and not\n only forbade any one to pick them, but would not allow any one to approach the\n place: and on this the marsh dried up; and for the future it not only never\n produced the abovementioned fruit, but it does not appear even to have furnished\n any water. And something very like this happened at Aedepsus. For at a distance\n from all other waters there was a spring sending forth cold water at no great\n distance from the sea; and invalids who drank this water were greatly benefited:\n on which account many repaired thither from great distances, to avail themselves\n of the water. Accordingly the generals of king Antigonus, wishing to be economical\n with respect to it, imposed a tax to be paid by those who drank it: and on this\n the spring dried up. And in the Troas in former times all who wished it were at\n liberty to draw water from the Tragas\u00e6an lake; but when Lysimachus became ruler\n there, and put a tax on it, that lake, too, disappeared: and as he marvelled at\n this, as soon as he remitted the tribute and left the place free, the water came\n again. \n ","3":"\n With respect to Cucumbers.\u2014There is a proverb\u2014 \n Eat the cucumber, O woman, and weave your cloak. \n And Matron says, in his Parodies\u2014 \n And I saw a cucumber, the son of the all-glorious Earth, \n Lying among the herbs; and it was served up on nine tables. \n \n And Laches says\u2014 \n But, as when cucumber grows up in a dewy place, \n Now the Attic writers always use the word \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd as a word of three syllables. But Alc\u00e6us uses it as a\n dissyllble, \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03c2 ; for he says, \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd from the nominative \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03c2, a word like \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2. And Phrynichus uses the word \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd as a diminutive, where he says\u2014 \n \n \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, to eat a little\n cucumber. \n \n [ From this point are the genuine\n words of Athen\u0153us. ] \n \n \n I will send radishes and four cucumbers. \n And Phrynichus too used the word \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \n as a diminutive, in his Monotropus; where he says, \u03ba\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n ","4":"\n But Theophrastus says that there are three kinds of cucumbers, the Laced\u00e6monian,\n the Scytalian, and the B\u0153otian; and that of these the Laced\u00e6monian, which is a\n watery one, is the best; and that the others do not contain water.\n Cucumbers too, says he, contain a more agreeable and\n wholesome juice if the seed be steeped in milk or in mead before it is\n sown; and he asserts in his book on the Causes of Plants, that they\n come up quicker if they are steeped either in water or milk before they are put in\n the ground. And Euthydemus says, in his treatise on Vegetables, that there is one\n kind of cucumber which is called \u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. But\n Demetrius Ixios states, in the first book of his treatise on Etymologies, that the\n name \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd is derived \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\n \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, from bursting forth and\n proceeding; for that it is a thing which spreads fast and wide. But\n Heraclides of Tarentum calls the cucumber \u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, which means growing in \n sweet earth, or making the earth\n sweet, in his Symposium. And Diocles of Carystos says that cucumber, if it\n is eaten with the sium in the first course, makes the eater uncomfortable; for\n that it gets into the head as the radish does; but that if it is eaten at the end\n of supper it causes no uncomfortable feelings, and is more\n digestible; and that when it is boiled it is moderately diuretic. But Diphilus\n says\u2014 The cucumber being a cooling food is not very manageable, and is not\n easily digested or evacuated; besides that, it creates shuddering feelings and\n engenders bile, and is a great preventive against amatory feelings. But\n cucumber grow in gardens at the time of full moon, and at that time they grow very\n visibly, as do the sea-urchins. \n ","5":"\n With respect to Figs.-The fig-tree, says Magnus, (for I will not allow any one to\n take what I have to say about figs out of my mouth, not if I were to be hanged for\n it, for I am most devilishly fond of figs, and I will say what occurs to me;) \"the\n fig-tree, my friends, was the guide to men to lead them to a more civilized life.\n And this is plain from the fact that the Athenians call the place where it was\n first discovered The Sacred Fig; and the fruit from it they call hegeteria, that is to say, the guide, \n because that was the first to be discovered of all the fruits now in cultivation.\n Now there are many species of figs;\u2014there is the Attic sort, which Antiphanes\n speaks of in his Synonymes; and when he is praising the land of Attica, he says\u2014\n \n \n A. What fruits this land produces! \n Superior, O Hipponicus, to the world. \n What honey, what bread, what figs! \n \n Hipp. It does, by Jove! \n Bear wondrous figs. \n And Isistrus, in his Attics, says that it was forbidden to\n export out of Attica the figs which grew in that country, in order that the\n inhabitants might have the exclusive enjoyment of them. And as many people were\n detected in sending them away surreptitiously, those who laid informations against\n them before the judges were then first called sycophants. And Alexis says, in his\n The Poet \u2014 \n The name of sycophant is one which does \n Of right apply to every wicked person; \n For figs when added to a name might show \n Whether the man was good and just and pleasant \n But now when a sweet name is given a rogue, \n It makes us doubt why this should be the case. \n And Philomnestus, in his treatise on the Festival of Apollo at Rhodes,\n which is called the Sminthian festival, says\u2014\"Since the sycophant got his name\n from these circumstance, because at that time there were\n fines and taxes imposed upon figs and oil and wine, by the produce of which\n imposts they found money for the public expenses; they called those who exacted\n these fines and laid these informations sycophants, which was very natural,\n selecting those who were accounted the most considerable of the citizens. \n ","6":"\n And Aristophanes mentions the fig, in his Farmers; speaking as\n follows:\u2014 \n I am planting figs of all sorts except the Laced\u00e6monian, \n For this kind is the fig of an enemy and a tyrant: \n And it would not have been so small a fruit if it had not been a great hater\n of the people. \n But he called it small because it was not a large plant. But Alexis, in\n his Olynthian, mentioning the Phrygian figs, says\u2014 \n And the beautiful fig, \n The wonderful invention of the Phrygian fig, \n The diine object of my mother's care. \n And of those figs which are called \u03c6\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b9, mention is made by many of the comic writers; and\n Pherecrates, in his Crapatalli, says\u2014 \n O my good friend, make haste and catch a fever, \n And then alarm yourself with no anxiety, \n But eat Phibalean figs all the summer; \n And then, when you have eaten your fill, sleep the whole of the midday; \n And then feel violent pains, get in a fever, and holloa. \n And Teleclides, in his Amphictyons, says\u2014 \n How beautiful those Phibalean figs are! \n They also call myrtle-berries Phibalean. As Antiphanes does in his\n Cretans \u2014 \n . . . . . But first of all \n I want some myrtle-berries on the table, \n Which I may eat when e'er I counsel take; \n And they must be Phibalean, very fine, \n Fit for a garland. \n Epigenes too mentions Chelidonian figs, that is, figs fit for swallows,\n in his Bacchea\u2014 \n Then, in a little while, a well-fill'd basket \n Of dry Chelidonian figs is brought in. \n And Androtion, or Philippus, or Hegemon, in the Book of the Farm, gives a\n list of these kinds of figs, saying\u2014\"In the plain it is\n desirable to plant specimens of the Chelidonian fig, of the fig called Erinean, of\n the Leukerinean, and of the Phibalean; but plant the Oporobasilis, the queen of\n autumn, everywhere; for each kind has some useful qualities; and, above all, the\n pollarded trees, and the phormynian, and the double bearers, and the Megarian, and\n the Laced\u00e6monian kinds are desirable, if there is plenty of water. \n ","7":"\n Lynceus, too, mentions the fig-trees which grow in Rhodes, in his Epistles;\n instituting a comparison between the best of the Athenian kinds and the Rhodian\n species. And he writes in these terms:\u2014 But these fig-trees appear to vie\n with Laced\u00e6monian trees of the same kind, as mulberries do with figs; and they\n are put on the table before supper, not after supper as they are here, when the\n taste is already vitiated by satiety, but while the appetite is still\n uninfluenced and unappeased. And if Lynceus had tasted the figs which\n in the beautiful Rome are called \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1, as\n I have, he would have been by far more long-sighted than ever his namesake was. So\n very far superior are those figs to all the other figs in the whole world. \n Other kinds of figs grown near Rome are held in high esteem; and those called the\n Chian figs, and the Libianian; those two named the Chalcidic, and the African\n figs; as Herodotus the Lycian bears witness, in his treatise on Figs. \n ","8":"\n But Parmeno the Byzantine, in his Iambics, speaks of the figs which come from\n Can\u00e6, an Aeolian city, as the best of all: saying\u2014 \n I am arrived after a long voyage, not having brought \n A valuable freight of Can\u00e6an figs. \n And that the figs from Caunus, a city of Caria, are much praised, is\n known to all the world. There is another sort of fig, called the Oxalian, which\n Heracleon the Ephesian makes mention of, and Nicander of Thyatira, quoting what is\n mentioned by Apollodorus of Carystus, in his play, called the Dress-seller with a\n Dowry;\" where he says\u2014 \n Moreover, all the wine \n Was very sour and thin, so that I felt \n Ashamed to see it; for all other farms \n In the adjacent region bear the figs \n Ycleped Oxalian; and mine bears vines. \n Figs also grow in the island of Paros, (for those which are called by the Parians \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \n are a different fig from the common one, and are not what I am alluding to here;\n for the \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 are the same with those which are\n called Lydian figs; and they have obtained this name on account of their red\n colour, since \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 means blood, and they are\n mentioned by Archilochus, who speaks in this manner:\u2014 \n Never mind Paros, and the figs which grow \n Within that marble island, and the life \n Of its seafaring islanders. \n But these figs are as far superior to the ordinary run of figs which are\n grown in other places as the meat of the wild boar is superior to that of all\n other animals of the swine tribe which are not wild. \n ","9":"\n The \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 is a kind of fig-tree; and perhaps\n it is that kind which produces the white figs; Hermippus mentions it in his\n Iambics, in these terms\u2014 \n There are besides the Leucerinean figs. \n And the figs called \u1f10\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u1f76, or \u1f10\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6, are mentioned by Euripides in his\n Sciron \u2014 \n Or else to fasten him on the erinean boughs. \n And Epicharmus says, in his Sphinx,\u2014 \n But these are not like the erinean figs. \n And Sophocles, in his play entitled The Wedding of Helen, \n by a sort of metaphor, calls the fruit itself by the name of the tree; saying\u2014\n \n A ripe \u1f10\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 is a useless thing \n For food, and yet you ripen others by \n Your conversation. \n And he uses the masculine gender here, saying \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd\n \u1f14\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, instead of \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. \n Alexis also says in his Caldron \u2014 \n And why now need we speak of people who \n Sell every day their figs in close pack'd baskets, \n And constantly do place those figs below \n Which are hard and bad; but on top they range \n The ripe and beautiful fruit.

Strattis says, in his Troilus\u2014\n \n Have you not perceived a wild fig-tree near her? \n \n And Homer says\u2014 \n There stands a large wild fig-tree flourishing with leaves. \n And Amerias says, that the figs on the wild fig-trees are called \u1f10\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n ","10":"\n Hermonax, in his book on the Cretan Languages, gives a catalogue of the different\n kinds of figs, and speaks of some as \u1f01\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1 and as\n \u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b5\u03b1 ; and Philemon, in his book on Attic\n Dialects, says, that some figs are called royals, from which also the dried figs\n are called \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, or royal; stating besides,\n that the ripe figs are called \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1. Seleucus,\n too, in his Book on Dialects, says that there is a fruit called \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, being exceedingly like a fig in shape: and\n that women guard against eating them, because of their evil effects; as also Plato\n the comic writer says, in his Cleophon. And Pamphilus says, that the winter figs\n are called Cydon\u00e6a by the Ach\u00e6ans, saying, that Aristophanes said the very same\n thing in his Laced\u00e6monian Dialects. Hermippus, in his Soldiers, says that there is\n a kind of fig called Coracean, using these words\u2014 \n Either Phibalean figs, or Coracean. \n Theophrastus, in the second book of his treatise on Plants, says that\n there is a sort of fig called Charitian Aratean. And in his third book he says,\n that in the district around the Trojan Ida, there is a sort of fig growing in a\n low bush, having a leaf like that of the linden-tree; and that it bears red figs,\n about the size of an olive, but rounder, and in its taste like a medlar. And\n concerning the fig which is called in Crete the Cyprian fig, the same\n Theophrastus, in his fourth book of his History of Plants, writes as follows:\u2014\n \"The fig called in Crete the Cyprian fig, bears fruit from its stalk, and from its\n stoutest branches; and it sends forth a small leafless shoot, like a little root,\n attached to which is the fruit. The trunk is large, and very like that of the\n white poplar, and its leaf is like that of the elm. And it produces four fruits,\n according to the number of the shoots which it puts forth. Its sweetness resembles\n that of the common fig; and within it resembles the wild fig: but in size it is\n about equal to the cuckoo-apple. \n ","11":"\n Again, of the figs called prodromi, or precocious the same\n Theophrastus makes mention in the third book of his Causes of Plants, in this\n way\u2014 When a warm and damp and soft air comes to the\n fig-tree, then it excites the germination, from which the figs are called\n prodromi. And proceeding further, he says\u2014 And again, some trees\n bear the prodromi, namely, the Laced\u00e6monian fig-tree, and the leucomphaliac,\n and several others; but some do not bear them. But Seleucus, in his\n book on Languages, says that there is a kind of fig called \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74, which bears very early fruit. And Aristophanes, in his\n Ecclesiazus\u00e6, speaks of a double-bearing fig-tree\u2014 \n Take for a while the fig-tree's leaves \n Which bears its crop twice in the year. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Scleri\u00e6\u2014 \n 'Tis by the double-bearing fig-tree there below. \n But Theopompus, in the fifty-fourth book of his Histories, says\u2014 At\n the time when Philip reigned about the territory of the Bisalt\u00e6, and Amphipolis\n and Gr\u00e6stonia of Macedon, when it was the middle of spring, the fig-trees were\n loaded with figs, and the vines with bunches of grapes, and the olive-trees,\n though it was only the season for them to be just pushing, were full of olives.\n And Philip was successful in all his undertakings. But in the second\n book of his treatise on Plants, Theophrastus says that the wild fig also is\n double-bearing; and some say that it bears even three crops in the year, as for\n instance, at Ceos. \n ","12":"\n Theophrastus also says, that the fig-tree if planted among squills grows up\n faster, and is not so liable to be destroyed by worms: and, in fact, that\n everything which is planted among squills both grows faster and is more sure to be\n vigorous. And in a subsequent passage Theophrastus says, in the second book of his\n Causes\u2014 The fig called the Indian fig, though it is a tree of a wonderful\n size, bears a very small fruit; and not much of it; as if it had expended all\n its strength in making wood. And in the second book of his History of\n Plants, the philosopher says\u2014 There is also another kind of fig in Greece,\n and in Cilicia and Cyprus, which bears green figs; and that tree bears a real\n fig, \u03c3\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, in front of the leaf, and a green\n fig, \u1f44\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, behind the leaf. And these green\n figs grow wholly on the wood which is a year old, and not on the new\n wood. And this kind of fig-tree produces the green fig ripe and sweet,\n very different from the green fig which we have; and it grows to a much greater\n size than the genuine fig. And the time when it is in season is not long after the tree has made its wood. And I know, too, that there\n are many other names of fig-trees; there are the Royal, and the Fig Royal, and the\n Cirroc\u00e6ladian, and the Hyladian, and the Deerflesh, and the Lapyrian, and the\n Subbitter, and the Dragon-headed, and the White-faced, and the lack-faced, and the\n Fountain fig, and the Mylaic, and the Asclonian. \n ","13":"\n Tryphon also speaks of the names of figs in the second book of his History of\n Plants, and says that Dorion states, in his book of the Farm, that Sukeas, one of\n the Titans, being pursued by Jupiter, was received in her bosom as in an asylum by\n his mother Earth; and that the earth sent forth that plant as a place of refuge\n for her son; from whom also the city Sukea in Cilicia has its name. But Pherenicus\n the epic poet, a Heraclean by birth, says that the fig-tree ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6 ) is so called from Suke the daughter of Oxylus: for that Oxylus\n the son of Orius, having intrigued with his sister Hamadryas, had several\n children, and among them Carya (the nut-tree), Balanus (the acorn-bearing oak),\n Craneus (the cornel-tree), Orea (the ash), Aegeirus (the poplar), Ptelea (the\n elm), Am- pelus (the vine), Suke (the fig-tree): and that these daughters were all\n called the Hamadryad Nymphs; and that from them many of the trees were named. On\n which account Hipponax says\u2014 \n The fig-tree black, the sister of the vine. \n And Sosibius the Laced\u00e6monian, after stating that the fig-tree was the\n discovery of Bacchus, says that on this account the Laced\u00e6monians worship Bacchus\n Sukites. But the people of Naxus, as Andriscus and Aglaosthenes related, state\n that Bacchus is called Meilichius, because of his gift of the fruit of the\n fig-tree: and that on this account the face of the god whom they call Bacchus\n Dionysus is like a vine, and that of the god called Bacchus Meilichius is like a\n fig. For figs are called \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1 by the\n Naxians. \n ","14":"\n Now that the fig is the most useful to man of all the fruits which grow upon trees\n is sufficiently shown by Herodotus the Lycian, who urges this point at great\n length, in his treatise on Figs. For he says that young children grow to a great\n size if they are fed on the juice of figs. And Pherecrates, who wrote the Pers\u00e6,\n says\u2014 \n If any one of us, after absence, sees a fig, \n He will apply it like a plaster to his children's eyes: \n \n as if there were no ordinary medicinal power in the fig. And\n Herodotus, the most wonderful and sweet of all writers, says in the first book of\n his Histories, that figs are of the greatest good, speaking thus:\u2014 O king,\n you are preparing to make war upon men of this character, who wear breeches of\n leather, and all the rest of their garments are made of leather; and they eat\n not whatever they fancy, but what they have, since they have but a rough\n country; moreover they do not, by Jove, use wine, but they drink water; they\n have no figs to eat, nor any other good thing. \n \n And Polybius of Megalopolis, in the twelfth book of his Histories,\n says\u2014 Philip, the father of Perseus, when he overran Asia, being in want\n of provisions, took figs for his soldiers from the Magnesians, as they had no\n corn. On which account, too, when he became master of Myus, he gave that place\n to the Magnesians in return for their figs. And Ananius, the writer of\n Iambics, says\u2014 \n \n He who should shut up gold within his house, \n And a few figs, and two or three men, \n Would see how far the figs surpass the gold. \n \n ","15":"\n And when Magnus had said all this about figs, Daphnus the physician said:\n Philotimus, in the third book of his treatise on Figs, says, \"There is a great\n deal of difference between the various kinds of figs when fresh; both in their\n sorts, and in the times when each is in season, and in their effects; not but what\n one may lay down some general rules, and say that the juicy ones and those which\n are full ripe are quickly dissolved and are digested more easily than any other\n fruit whatever, nor do they interfere with the digestion of other sorts of food;\n and they have the ordinary properties of all juicy food, being glutinous and\n sweet, and slightly nitrous in taste. And they make the evacuations more copious\n and fluid, and rapid and wholly free from discomfort; and they also diffuse a\n saltish juice, having a good deal of harshness, when they are combined with\n anything at all salt. They are very quickly dissolved by the digestion, because,\n though many heavy things may be taken into the stomach, we still after a short\n time feel as if we had become excessively empty: but this could not have happened\n if the figs had remained in the stomach, and were not immediately dissolved. And\n figs are dissolved more easily than any other fruit; as is\n proved not only by the fact that though we eat a great many times as great a\n quantity of figs as of all other fruits put together, we still never feel\n inconvenienced by them; and even if we eat a quantity of figs before dinner, and\n then eat as much of other things as if we had never touched them, we still feel no\n discomfort. It is plain, therefore, that if we can manage both them and the rest\n of our food, they must be easily digested; and that is why they do not interfere\n with the digestion of the rest of our food. \n \n Figs, then, have the qualities which I have mentioned. That they are\n glutinous and rather salt is proved by their being sticky and cleansing the\n hands; and we see ourselves that they are sweet in the mouth. And it certainly\n needs no arguments to prove that our evacuations after eating them take place\n without any convulsions or trouble, and that they are more numerous and more\n rapid and more easy in consequence. And they do not go through any great\n decomposition in the stomach, which arises not from their being indigestible,\n but because we drink while eating them, without waiting for the action of the\n stomach to soften them, and also because they pass through the stomach so\n quickly. And they generate a salt juice in the stomach, because it has been\n already shown that they contain something of nitre in them: and they will make\n that food taste rather salt and harsh which is combined with them. For salt\n increases the briny taste of anything, but vinegar and thyme increase the harsh\n qualities of food. \n \n ","16":"\n Now Heraclides the Tarentine asks this question; Whether it is best to\n drink warm water or cold after the eating of figs? And he says, that\n those who recommend the drinking of cold water do so because they have an eye to\n such a fact as this,\u2014that warm water cleanses one's hands more quickly than cold;\n on which account it is reasonable to believe that food in the stomach will be\n quickly washed away by warm water. And with respect to figs which are not eaten,\n warm water dissolves their consistency and connexion, and separates them into\n small pieces; but cold coagultes and consolidates them. But those who recommend\n the drinking of cold water say, the taking of cold water bears down by its own\n weight the things which are heavy on the stomach; (for figs do not do any\n extraordinary good to the stomach, since they heat it and\n destroy its tone; on which account some people always drink neat wine after them;)\n and then too it quickly expels what is already in the stomach. But after eating\n figs, it is desirable to take an abundant and immediate draught of something or\n other; in order to prevent those things from remaining in the stomach, and to move\n them into the lower parts of the bowels. \n ","17":"\n Others however say, that it is not a good thing to eat figs at midday; for that at\n that time they are apt to engender diseases, as Pherecrates has said in his\n Crapatalli. And Aristophanes, in his Proagon, says\u2014 \n But once seeing him when he was sick in the summer, \n In order to be sick too himself, eat figs at midday. \n And Eubulus says, in his Sphingocarion\u2014 \n No doubt it was; for I was sick, my friend, \n From eating lately figs one day at noon. \n And Nicophon says, in the Sirens\u2014 \n But if a man should eat green figs at noon, \n And then go off to sleep; immediately \n A galloping fever comes on him, accursed, \n And falling on him brings up much black bile. \n \n \n ","18":"\n Diphilus of Siphnos says, that of figs some are tender, and not very nutritious,\n but full of bad juice, nevertheless easily secreted, and rising easily to the\n surface; and that these are more easily managed than the dry figs; but that those\n which are in season in the winter, being ripened by artificial means, are very\n inferior: but that the best are those which are ripe at the height of the summer,\n as being ripened naturally; and these have a great deal of juice; and those which\n are not so juicy are still good for the stomach, though somewhat heavy. And the\n figs of Tralles are like the Rhodian: and the Chian, and all the rest, appear to\n be inferior to these, both in the quality and quantity of their juice. But\n Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on Eatables, says\u2014 But with\n respect to whatever of these fruits are eaten raw, such as pears, and figs, and\n Delphic apples, and such fruits, one ought to watch the opportunity when they\n will have the juice which they contain, neither unripe on the one hand, nor\n tainted on the other; nor too much dried up by the season. But\n Demetrius the Scepsian, in the fifteenth book of the Trojan Preparation, says,\n that those who never eat figs have the best voices. At all\n events, he says, that Hegesianax the Alexandrian, who wrote the Histories, was\n originally a man with a very weak voice, and that he became a tragedian and a fine\n actor, and a man with a fine voice, by abstaining from figs for eighteen years\n together. And I know too that there are some proverbs going about concerning figs,\n of which the following are samples:\u2014 \n Figs after fish, vegetables after meat. \n Figs are agreeable to birds, but they do not choose to plant them. \n \n \n ","19":"\n Apples are an universal fruit. Mnesitheus the Athe- nian, in his treatise on\n Eatables, calls them Delphian apples; but Diphilus says, that those apples\n which are green and which are not yet ripe, are full of bad juice, and are bad\n for the stomach; but are apt to rise to the surface, and also to engender bile;\n and they give rise to diseases, and produce sensations of shuddering. But of\n ripe apples, he says, that the sweet ones are those with most juice, and that\n they are the most easily secreted, because they have no great inflammatory\n qualities. But that sharp apples have a more disagreeable and mischievous\n juice, and are more astringent. And that those which have less sweetness are\n still pleasant to the palate when eaten; and, on account of their having some\n strengthening qualities, are better for the stomach. And moreover, that of this\n fruit those which are in season in the summer have a juice inferior to the\n others; but those which are ripe in the autumn have the better juice. And that\n those which are called \u1f40\u03c1\u03b2\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, have a good\n deal of sweetness combined with their invigorating properties, and are very\n good for the stomach. But those which are called \u03c3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, and also those which are called \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, are full of good juice, and are easily secreted, but\n are not good for the stomach. But those which are called Mordianian are very\n excellent, being produced in Apollonia, which is called Mordius; and they are\n like those which are called \u1f40\u03c1\u03b2\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, But the\n Cydonian apples, or quinces, some of which are called \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1, are, as a general rule, better for the stomach than any\n other kind of apple, most especially when they are full ripe. \n \n But Glaucides asserts that the best of all fruits which grow upon trees are the\n Cydonian apples, and those which are called phaulia, and strouthia. And\n Philotimus, in his third book, and also in his tenth book of\n his treatise on Food, says\u2014 \"Of apples, those which come in season in spring are\n by far more indigestible than pears, whether they are both unripe, or whether they\n are both ripe. But they have the properties of juicy fruits; the sharp apples, and\n those which are not yet ripe, resembling those pears which have a harsher taste\n and which are in a certain degree sour; and they diffuse over the body a juice\n which is said to be corrosive. And, as a general rule, apples are not so\n digestible as pears; on which account those who are less addicted to eating them\n are less troubled with indigestions, and those who are most fond of them are the\n most liable to such inconvenience. But, as I said before, a corrosive juice is\n engendered by them, as is stated by Praxagoras, and as is shown by the fact that\n those things which are not digested will have the juice thicker. (And I have\n already said that, as a general rule, apples are less digestible than pears.) And\n the harsh and sour apples are in the habit of engendering thicker juices. \n But of those apples which are in season in the winter, the Cydonian give out the\n more bitter juices, and those called strouthian give out juice more sparingly;\n though what they do give out is not so harsh tasted, and is more digestible.\" But\n Nicander of Thyatira says, that the Cydonian apples themselves are called \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ; but he says this out of ignorance. For\n Glaucides asserts plainly enough that the best of all fruits which grow on trees\n are the Cydonian apples and those called phaulian and strouthian. \n ","20":"\n Stesichorus also mentions the Cydonian apples, in his Helena, speaking thus:\n \n Before the king's most honour'd throne, \n I threw Cydonian apples down; \n And leaves of myrrh, and crowns of roses, \n And violets in purple posies. \n Alcman mentions them too. And Cantharus does so like- wise, in the\n Tereus; where he says\u2014 \n Likening her bosom to Cydonian apples. \n And Philemon, in his Clown, calls Cydonian apples strouthia. And\n Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories, says that apples by their sweet\n fragrance can blunt the efficacy of even deadly poisons. At all events, he says,\n that some Phariacan poison having been cast into a chest still smelling from having had some of these apples stored away in it, lost all\n its effect, and preserved none of its former power, but was mixed and given to\n some people who were plotted against, but that they escaped all harm. And that\n afterwards it was ascertained, by an investigation and examination of the man who\n had sold the poison; and that he felt sure that it arose from the fact of the\n apples having been put away in the chest. \n ","21":"\n Hermon, in his Cretan Dialects, says that Cydonian apples are called \u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1. But Polemo, in the fifth book of the treatise\n against Tim\u00e6us, says that some people affirm that the \u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd is a kind of flower. But Alcman asserts that it is the\n same as the \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd apple, when he says,\n less than a \u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. \n And Apollodorus and Sosibius understand the Cydonian apple by \u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. But that the Cydonian apple differs from the\n \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, Theophrastus has asserted clearly\n enough in the second book of his History. Moreover, there are excellent apples\n grown at Sidus, (that is, a village in the Corinthian territory,) as Euphorion or\n Archytas says, in the poem called The Crane: \u2014 \n Like a beautiful apple which is grown on the clayey banks \n Of the little Sidus, refulgent with purple colour. \n And Nicander mentions them in his Transformed, in this manner:\u2014 \n And immediately, from the gardens of Sidoeis or Pleistus \n He cut green apples, and imitated the appearance of Cadmus. \n And that Sidus is a village of the Corinthian territory, Rhianus assures\n us, in the first book of the Heraclea; and Apollodorus the Athenian confirms it,\n in the fifth book On the Catalogue of the Ships. But Antigonus the Carystian says,\n in his Antipater\u2014 \n \n More dear to me was he than downy apples \n Of purple hue, in lofty Corinth growing. \n \n ","22":"\n And Teleclides mentions the Phaulian apples, in his Amphictyons, in these terms:\u2014\n \n O men, in some things neat, but yet in others \n More fallen than phaulian apples! \n And Theopompus also speaks of them, in the Theseus. But Androtion, in his\n Book of the Farm, says, that some apple-trees are called \u03c6\u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, and others \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 ;\n for, says he, the apple does not fall from the footstalk\n of the strouthian apple-tree. And that others are called spring-trees,\n or Lace- d\u00e6monian, or Siduntian, or woolly. But I, my\n friends, admire above all others the apples which are sold at Rome, which are\n called the Mattianian; and which are said to be brought from a certain village\n situated on the Alps near Aquileia. And the apples which grow at Gangra, a city of\n Paphlagonia, are not much inferior to them. But that Bacchus was the discoverer of\n the apple we have the testimony of Theocritus the Syracusan, who writes thus:\u2014\n \n Guarding the apples in the bosom of Bacchus; \n And having on his head a poplar garland, \n The silv'ry tree, sacred to Theban Hercules. \n But Neoptolemus the Parian testifies himself, in his Dionysias, that the\n apple was discovered by Bacchus, as were all other fruits which grow on trees. \n There is a fruit called epimelis; which is, says\n Pamphilus, a description of pear. But Timachides asserts, in the fourth book of\n The Banquet, that it is an apple, the same as that called the apple of the\n Hesperides. And Pamphilus asserts that at Laced\u00e6mon they are set before the gods;\n and that they have a sweet smell, but are not very good to eat; and are called the\n apples of the Hesperides. At all events, Aristocrates, in the fourth book of his\n Affairs of Laced\u00e6mon, says, And besides that apples, and those which are\n called Hesperides. \n \n ","23":"\n Walnuts are next to be mentioned.\u2014Theophrastus, in the second book of his History\n of Plants, speaking of those whose fruit is not visible, says this among other\n things:\u2014 Since the beginning of all the greater fruits is visible, as of\n the almond, the nut, the date, and other fruits of the same kind; except the\n walnut, in which that is not at all the case; and with the exception also of\n the pomegranate and of the female pear. But Diphilus of Siphnos, in his\n book about What should be eaten by People when Sick and by People in Health,\"\n says\u2014 The fruit called the Persian apple or peach, and by some the\n Persian cuckoo-apple, is moderately juicy, but is more nutritious than\n apples. But Philotimus, in the second and third books of his treatise\n on Food, says that the Persian nut or walnut is more oily and like millet, and\n that being a looser fruit, when it is pressed it yields a great quantity of oil.\n But Aristophanes the grammarian, in his Laced\u00e6monian Dialects, says that the\n Laced\u00e6monians call the cuckoo-apples Persian bitter apples; and that some people\n call them \u1f04\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1. \n \n \n ","24":"\n The Citron was next mentioned.\u2014And with respect to this fruit there was a great\n discussion among the Deipnosophists, as to whether there is any mention made of it\n by the ancients. For Myrtilus said, proposing, as it were, to send us who made the\n inquiry to feed among the wild goats, that Hegesander the Delphian, in his\n Memorials, does make mention of this fruit; but that he did not recollect the\n exact words: and Plutarch, contradicting him, said,\u2014But I indeed contend, that\n Hegesander never mentions the citron at all, for I read through the whole of his\n Memorials for the express purpose of seeing whether he did or no; since some other\n of our companions also asserted positively that he did, trusting to some\n scholastic commentaries of a man whom he considered respectable enough. So that it\n is time for you, my good friend Myrtilus, to seek for some other witness. But\n Aemilianus said, that Jobas the king of the Mauritanians, a man of the most\n extensive learning, in his History of Libya, does mention the citron, saying that\n it is called among the Libyans the Hesperian apple, and that they were citrons\n which Hercules carried into Greece, and which obtained the name of golden apples on account of their colour and appearance.\n But the fruit which is called the apples of the Hesperides, is said to have been\n produced by Terra, on the occasion of the marriage of Jupiter and Juno, according\n to the statement of Asclepiades, in the sixtieth book of his History of the\n Affairs of Egypt. On this, Democritus, looking towards the speakers, said,\u2014If,\n indeed, Jobas asserts any of these things, let him take pleasure in his Libyan\n books, and in the nonsense of Hanno. But I repeat the assertion, that the name citron does not occur in the old authors. But the fruit\n which is described by Theophrastus the Eresian, in his Histories of Plants, is\n described in such a manner as to compel me to believe that he intended the citron\n by what he said. \n ","25":"\n For that philosopher says, in the fourth book of his History of Plants\u2014 The\n Median territory, and like wise the Persian, has many other productions, and\n also the Perian or Median apple. Now, that tree has a leaf very like and almost\n exactly the same as that of the bay-tree, the arbutus, or the nut: and it has\n thorns like the prickly-pear, or blackthorn, smooth but very sharp and strong.\n And the fruit is not good to eat, but is very fragrant, and so too are the leaves of the tree. And if any one puts one of the\n fruits among his clothes, it keeps them from the moth. And it is useful when\n any one has taken poison injurious to life; for when given in wine it produces\n a strong effect on the bowels, and draws out the poison. It is serviceable also\n in the way of making the breath sweet; for if any one boils the inner part of\n the fruit in broth or in anything else, and then presses it in his mouth and\n swallows it, it makes his breath smell sweet. And the seed is taken out and is\n sown in spring in square beds, being very carefully cultivated; and then it is\n watered every fourth or fifth day; and when it has grown up it is again\n transplanted the next spring into a place where the ground is soft, and\n well-watered, and not very thin. And it bears fruit every year; some of which\n are fit to be gathered, and some are in flower, and some are becoming ripe at\n the same time. And those of the flowers which have a stem like a distaff\n projecting out of the centre are sure to produce good seed; but those which\n have no such stem are unproductive. And in the first book of the same\n treatise he says the same thing about the distaff, and about the flowers which are\n productive. And I am induced by these things, my mates, and by what Theophrastus\n says of the colour and smell and leaves of the fruit, to believe that the fruit\n meant by him is the citron; and let no one of you marvel if he says that it is not\n good to eat; since until the time of our grandfathers no one was used to eat it,\n but they put it away as a treasure in their chests along with their clothes. \n ","26":"\n But that this plant really did come from that upper country into Greece, one may\n find asserted in the works of the Comic poets, who, speaking of its size, appear\n to point out the citron plainly enough. Antiphanes says, in his B\u0153otian\u2014 \n \n A. 'Tis silly to say a word about roast meat \n To men who're ne'er content. But now, my girl, \n Just take these apples. \n \n B. They are fine to look at. \n \n A. Indeed they are, and good too, O ye gods! \n For this seed has arrived not long ago \n In Athens, coming from the mighty king. \n \n B. I thought it came from the Hesperides; \n For there they say the golden apples grow. \n \n A. They have but three. \n \n B. That which is very beautiful \n Is rare in every place, and so is dear. \n \n And Eriphus, in his Melib\u0153a, quotes these selfsame Iambics of\n Antiphanes, and then proceeds in his own words:\u2014 \n \n B. I thought, I swear by Dian, that they came \n From out the garden of the Hesperides, \n For they, they say, do keep the golden apples. \n \n A. They have but three. \n \n B. That which is very beautiful \n Is rare in every place, and so is dear. \n \n A. I'll sell you these now for a single penny, \n And even that I'll put down in the bill. \n \n B. Are they not pomegranates? how fine they are! \n \n A. Fine! yes\u2014they say that Venus did herself \n Plant this the parent tree in Cyprus, where it stands. \n Take it, my dear Berbeias. \n \n B. Thank you kindly. \n \n A. Take also these three; they are all I had. \n And if any one is able to contradict this, and to show that these\n descriptions are not meant to apply to the fruit which we now call the citron, let\n him bring forward some clearer testimonies. \n ","27":"\n However, Ph\u00e6nias the Eresian compels us to entertain the idea that, perhaps, the\n name may be meant for cedron, as from the cedar-tree. For,\n in the fifth book of his treatise on Plants, he says that the cedar has thorns\n around its leaves; and that the same is the case with the citron is visible to\n everybody. But that the citron when eaten before any kind of food, whether dry or\n moist, is an antidote to all injurious effects, I am quite certain, having had\n that fact fully proved to me by my fellow-citizen, who was entrusted with the\n government of Egypt. He had condemned some men to be given to wild beasts, as\n having been convicted of being malefactors, and such men he said were only fit to\n be given to beasts. And as they were going into the theatre appropriated to the\n punishment of robbers, a woman who was selling fruit by the wayside gave them out\n of pity some of the citron which she herself was eating, and they took it and ate\n it, and after a little while, being exposed to some enormous and savage beasts,\n and bitten by asps, they suffered no injury. At which the governor was mightily\n astonished. And at last, examining the soldier who had charge of them, whether\n they had eaten or drunk anything, when he learnt of him that some citron had been\n given to them without any evil design; on the next day he ordered some citron to\n be given o some of them again, and others to have none given to them And those who eat the citron, though they were bitten, received no\n injury, but the others died immediately on being bitten. And this result being\n proved by repeated experiments, it was found that citron was an antidote to all\n sorts of pernicious poison. But if any one boils a whole citron with its seed in\n Attic honey, it is dissolved in the honey, and he who takes two or three mouthfuls\n of it early in the morning will never experience any evil effects from poison. \n ","28":"\n Now if any one disbelieves this, let him learn from Theopompus the Chian, a man of\n the strictest truth and who expended a great deal of money on the most accurate\n investigation of matters to be spoken of in his History. For he says, in the\n thirty-eighth book of his History, while giving an account of Clearchus, the\n tyrant of the Heracleans who were in Pontus, that he seized violently upon a\n number of people and gave a great many of them hemlock to drink.\u2014 And\n as, says he, they all knew that he was in the habit of\n compelling them to pledge him in this liquor, they never left their homes\n without first eating rue: for people who have eaten this beforehand take no\n harm from drinking aconite,\u2014 a poison which, they say, has its name from\n growing in a place called Acon\u00e6, which is not far from Heraclea. When\n Democritus had said this they all marvelled at the efficacy of citron, and most of\n them ate it, as if they had had nothing to eat or drink before. But Pamphilus, in\n his Dialects, says that the Romans call it not \u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, but \u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n ","29":"\n And after the viands which have been mentioned there were then brought unto us\n separately some large dishes of oysters, and other shell-fish, nearly all of which\n have been thought by Epicharmus worthy of being celebrated in his play of the\n Marriage of Hebe, in these words:\u2014 \n Come, now, bring all kinds of shell-fish; \n Lepades, aspedi, crabyzi, strabeli, cecibali, \n Tethunachia, balani, porphyry\u00e6, and oysters with closed shells, \n Which are very difficult to open, but very easy to eat; \n And mussels, and anarit\u00e6, and ceryces, and sciphydria, \n Which are very sweet to eat, but very prickly to touch; \n And also the oblong solens. And bring too the black \n Cockle, which keeps the cockle-hunter on the stretch. \n Then too there are other cockles, and sand-eels, \n And periwinkles, unproductive fish, \n Which men entitle banishers of men, \n But which we gods call white and beautiful. \n \n \n \n ","30":"\n And in the Muses it is written\u2014 \n There is the cockle, which we call the tells; \n Believe me, that is most delicious meat. \n Perhaps he means that fish which is called the tellina, and which the Romans call the mitlus, \u2014a\n fish which Aristophanes the grammarian names in his treatise on the Broken\n Scytale, and says that the lepas is a fish like that which is called the tellina.\n But Callias of Mitylene, in his discussion of the Limpet in Alc\u00e6us, says that\n there is an ode in Alc\u00e6us of which the beginning is\u2014 \n O child of the rock, and of the hoary sea; \n and at the end of it there is the line\u2014 \n Of all limpets the sea-limpet most relaxes the mind. \n But Aristophanes writes the line with the word tortoise instead of limpet. And he says that\n Dicearchus made a great blunder when he interpreted the line of limpets; and that\n the children when they get them in their mouths sing and play with them, just as\n idle boys among us do with the fish which we call tellina. And so, too, Sopater,\n the compiler of Comicalities, says in his drama which is entitled the\n Eubulotheombrotus:\u2014 \n But stop, for suddenly a certain sound \n Of the melodious tellina strikes my ears. \n And in another place Epicharmus, in his Pyrrha and Prometheus, says\u2014\n \n Just look now at this tellina, and behold \n This periwinkle and this splendid limpet. \n And in Sophron cockles are called mel\u0153nides. \n \n For now mel\u00e6nides will come to us, \n Sent from a narrow harbour. \n And in the play which is called The Clown and the\n Fisherman, they are called the cherambe. And\n Archilochus also mentions the cherambe: and Ibycus mentions the periwinkle. And\n the periwinkle is called both \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 and\n \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2. And the shell being something like\n that of a cockle, it sticks to the rocks, just as limpets do. But Herodas, in his\n Coadjutrixes, says\u2014 \n Sticking to the rocks as a periwinkle. \n And Aeschylus, in his Pers\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Who has plunder'd the islands producing the periwinkle? \n And Homer makes mention of the oyster. \n \n \n \n ","31":"\n Diodes the Carystian, in his treatise on the Whole- somes, says that the best of\n all shell-fish, as aperient and diuretic food, are mussels, oysters, scallops, and\n cockles. And Archippus says, in his poem called Fishes, \u2014 \n With limpets and sea-urchins and eschar\u00e6, \n And with periwinkles and cockles. \n And Diocles says that the strongest of all shell-fish are cockles,\n purple-fish, and ceryces. But concerning ceryces Archippus says this\u2014 \n The ceryx, ocean's nursling, child of purple. \n But Speusippus, in the second book of his Similarities, says that\n ceryces, purple-fish, strabeli, and cockles, are all very nearly alike. And\n Sophocles makes mention of the shellfish called strabeli in his Camici, in these\n words:\u2014 \n Come now, my son, and look if we may find \n Some of the nice strabelus, ocean's child. \n And again Speusippus enumerates separately in regular order the cockle,\n the periwinkle, the mussel, the pinna, the solens; and in another place he speaks\n of oysters and limpets. And Araros says, in his Campylion\u2014 \n These now are most undoubted delicacies, \n Cockles and solens; and the crooked locusts \n Spring forth in haste like dolphins. \n And Sophron says, in his Mimi\u2014 \n \n A. What are these long cockles, O my friend, \n Which you do think so much of? \n \n B. Solens, to be sure. \n This too is the sweet-flesh'd cockle, dainty food, \n The dish much loved by widows. \n And Cratinus also speaks of the pinna in his Archilochi\u2014 \n She indeed like pinnas and sea oysters. \n And Philyllius, or Eunicus, or Aristophanes, in the Cities, says\u2014 \n A little polypus, or a small cuttle-fish, \n A crab, a crawfish, oysters, cockles, \n Limpets and solens, mussels and pinnas; \n Periwinkles too, from Mitylene take; \n Let us have two sprats, and mullet, ling, \n And conger-eel, and perch, and black fish. \n But Agiastos, and Dercylus, in his Argolici, call the strabeli \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ; speaking of them as suitable to play upon\n like a trumpet. \n \n ","32":"\n But you may find cockles spoken of both in the masculine and feminine gender.\n Aristophanes says, in his Babylonians\u2014 \n They all gaped on each other, and were like \n To cockles ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9 ) roasted on the\n coals. \n And Teleclides, in his Hesiodi, says, Open a cocle ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03b7 ); and Sophron, in his Actresses, says\u2014\n \n And then the cockles ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9 ) as at one\n comma d \n All yawned on us, and each display'd its flesh. \n But Aeschylus uses the word \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 in the\n masculine gender, in his Glaucus Pontius, and says\u2014 \n Cockles ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 ) muscles, oysters. \n And Aristonymus, in his Theseus, says\u2014 \n There was a cockle ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) and other fish\n too drawn from the sea \n At the same time, and by the same net. \n And Phrynichus uses the word in the same way in his Satyrs. But Icesius,\n the Erasistratean, says that some cockles are rough, and some royal; and that the\n rough have a disagreeable juice, and afford but little nourishment, and are easily\n digested; and that people who are hunting for the purple-fish use them as bait:\n but of the smooth ones those are best which are the largest, in exact proportion\n to their size. And Hegesander, in his Memorials, says that the rough cockles are\n called by the Macedonians coryci, but by the Athenians crii. \n ","33":"\n Now Icesius says that limpets are more digestible than those shell-fish which have\n been already mentioned; but that oysters are not so nutritious as limpets, and are\n filling, but nevertheless are more digestible. \n But of mussels, the Ephesian ones, and those which resemble them, are, as to their\n juicy qualities, superior to the periwinkles, but inferior to the cockles; but\n they have more effect as diuretics than as aperients. But some of them are like\n squills, with a very disagreeable juice, and with put any flavour; but there is a\n kind which is smaller than they are, and which are rough outside, which are more\n diuretic, and full of a more pleasant juice than the kind which resembles squills:\n but they are less nutritious, by reason of their sizes, and also because their\n nature is inferior. But the necks of the ceryces are\n exceedingly good for the stomach, and are not so nutritious as mussels and cockles\n and periwinkles; but for people who have a weak stomach, and who do not easily\n expel the food into the cavity of the bowels, they are useful, inasmuch as they do\n not easily turn on the stomach. For those things which are confessedly digestible\n are, on the contrary, very unwholesome for people of such a constitution, being\n very easily inclined to turn on the stomach, because they are tender and easily\n dissolved. On which account the bags containing their entrails are not suited to\n vigorous stomachs, but they are very good for those whose bowels are in a weak\n state. But what are more nutritious than the others, and far nicer in taste, are\n the entrails of the purple-fish; though they certainly are somewhat like the\n squill. For indeed all shellfish are of the same character; but the purple-fish\n and the solen have this peculiar characteristic, that if they are boiled they\n yield a thick juice. But the necks of the purple-fish, when boiled by themselves,\n are exceedingly good for bringing the stomach into a good condition. And\n Posidippus speaks of them in his Locrians in these terms:\u2014 \n \n It is time now to eat eels and crabs, \n Cockles, and fresh sea-urchins, and fish sounds, \n And pinnas, and the necks of fish, and mussels. \n \n ","34":"\n Balani, if they are of the larger sort, are easily digested, and are good for the\n stomach. But otaria (and they are produced in the island called Pharos, which is\n close to Alexandria) are more nutritious than any of the before-mentioned fish,\n but they are not easily secreted. But Antigonus the Carystian, in his book upon\n Language, says that this kind of oyster is called by the Aeolians the Ear of\n Venus. Pholades are very nutritious, but they have a disagreeable smell; but\n common oysters are very like all these sorts of shell-fish, and are more\n nutritious. There are also some kinds which are called wild oysters; and they are\n very nutritious, but they have not a good smell, and moreover they have a very\n indifferent flavour. But Aristotle, in his treatise about Animals, says, \"Oysters\n are of all the following kinds: there are the pinna, the mussel, the oyster, the\n cteis, the solen, the cockle, the limpet, the small oyster, the balanus. And of\n migratory fish there are the purple-fish, the sweet purple-fish, the sea-urchin,\n the strobelus. Now the cteis has a rough shell, marked in streaks; but the oyster has no streaks, and a smooth shell. The pinna\n has a smooth mouth; but the large oyster has a vide mouth, and is bivalve, and has\n a smooth shell. But the limpet is univalve, and has a smooth shell; and the mussel\n has a united shell. The solen and balanus are univalve, and have a smooth shell;\n and the cockle is a mixture of both kinds. Ep\u00e6netus also says, in his Cookery\n Book, that the interior part of the pinna is called mecon. But in the fifth book\n of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle says, The purple-fish\n are born about spring, and the ceryces at the end of the winter. And\n altogether, says he, all shell-fish appear in the spring to have\n what are called eggs; and in the autumn, too, except those kinds of sea-urchins\n which are good to eat. And these fish indeed have eggs in the greatest number\n at those seasons, but they are never without them; and they have them in the\n greatest numbers at the time of full moon, and in the warm weather, with the\n exception of those fish which are found in the Euripus of the Pyrrh\u00e6ans; for\n they are best in the winter, and they are small, but full of eggs. And nearly\n all the cockle tribe appear to breed in like manner at about the same\n season. \n \n ","35":"\n And continuing the subject, the philosopher says again, The purple-fish\n therefore being all collected together in the spring at the same place, make\n what is called melicera. And that is something like honeycomb, but not indeed\n so elegant, but it is as if a great number of the husks of white vetches were\n fastened together; and there is no open passage in any of them: nor are the\n purple-fish born of this melicera, but they, and nearly all other shell-fish,\n are produced Of mud and putrefaction; and this is, as it were, a kind of\n purification both for them and for the purple-fish, for they too make this\n melicera. And when they begin to make it, they emit a sort of sticky mass, from\n which those things grow which resemble husks. All these are eventually\n separated, and they drop blood on the ground. And in the place where hey do so,\n there are myriads of little purple-fish born, adhering to one another in the\n ground, and the old purple-fish are caught while carrying them. And if they are\n caught before they have produced their young, they sometimes produce them in\n the very pots in which they are caught when collected together in them, and the\n young look like a bunch of grapes. And there are many\n different kinds of purple-fish; and some of them are of large size, like those\n which are found near Segeum and near Lesteum; and some are small, like those\n which are found in the Euripus, and around Caria. And those in the gulfs are\n large and rough, and most of them are of a black colour, but some of them are\n rather red; and some of the large ones even weigh a mina. But those which are\n found on the shore and around the coasts are of no great size, but are of a red\n colour: and again, those in the waters exposed to the north wind are black, and\n those in the waters exposed to the south wind are generally red. \n \n ","36":"\n But Apollodorus the Athenian, in his Commentaries on Sophron, having first quoted\n the saying, More greedy than a purple-fish, says that it is a\n proverb, and that some say that it applies to the dye of purple; for that whatever\n that dye touches it attracts to itself, and that it imbues everything which is\n placed near it with the brilliancy of its colour: but others say that it applies\n to the animal. And they are caught, says Aristotle, \"in the spring;\n but they are not caught during the dog-days, for then they do not feed, but\n conceal themselves and bury themselves in holes; and they have a mark like a\n flower on them between the belly and the throat. The fish called the ceryx has a\n covering of nearly the same sort as all the other animals of the snail kind from\n its earliest birth; and they feed by putting out what we call their shell from\n under this covering. And the purple-fish has a tongue of the size of a finger or\n larger, by which it feeds; and it pierces even shell-fish, and can pierce its own\n shell. But the purple-fish is very long-lived; and so is the ceryx: they live\n about six years, and their growth is known by the rings in their shell. But\n cockles, and cheme-cockles, and solens, and periwinkles, are born in sandy\n places. \n ","37":"\n But the pinn\u00e6 spring from the bottom of the sea. And they have with them a fish\n called the pinnophylax, or guard of the pinna, which some call \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and others \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ; and if they lose him, they are soon destroyed. But\n Pamphilus the Alexandrian, in his treatise on Names, says that he is born at the\n same time with the pinna. But Chrysippus the Solensian, in the fifth book of his\n treatise on the Beautiful and Pleasure, says, The pinna and the guard of\n the pinna assist one another, not being able to remain apart. Now the pinna is a kind of oyster, but the guard of the\n pinna is a small crab: and the pinna having opened its shell, remains quiet,\n watching the fish who are coming towards it; but the guard of the pinna,\n standing by when anything comes near, bites the pinna, so as to give it a sort\n of sign; and the pinna being bitten, closes its shell, and in this manner the\n two share together what is caught inside the pinna's shell. But some say that\n the guard is born at the same time as the pinna, and that they originate in one\n seed. And again, Aristotle says, All the fish of the oyster kind\n are generated in the mud,\u2014oysters in slimy mud, cockles in sandy mud, and so\n on; but the small oyster and the balanus, and other fish which come near the\n surface, such as limpets and periwinkles, are born in the fissures of the\n rocks. And some fish which have not shells are born in the same way as those\n which have shells,\u2014as the sea-nettle, the sponge, and others, \u2014in the crevices\n of the rocks. \n \n ","38":"\n Now, of the sea-nettle there are two kinds, For some live in hollows, and are\n never separated from the rocks; but some live on smooth and level ground, and do\n separate themselves from what they are attached to, and move their quarters. But\n Eupolis, in the Autolycus, calls the \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, or\n sea-nettle, \u1f00\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c6\u03b7. And Aristophanes, in his\n Ph\u0153niss\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Know that pot-herbs first were given, \n And then the rough sea-nettles ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9 ); \n and in his Wasps he uses the same word. And Pherecrates, in his\n Deserters, says\u2014 \n I'd rather wear a crown of sea-nettles ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And Diphilus the Siphnian, a physician, says, But the sea-nettle\n ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c6\u03b7 ) is good for the bowels, diuretic,\n and a strengthener of the stomach, but it makes those who collect them itch\n violently, unless they anoint their hands beforehand. And it is really\n injurious to those who hunt for it; by whom it has been called \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c6\u03b7, by a slight alteration of its original name.\n And perhaps that is the reason why the plant the nettle has had the same name\n given to it. For it was named by euphemism on the principle of antiphrasis,\u2014\n for it is not gentle and \u1f01\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u1f74 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f00\u03c6\u1fc7, tender\n to the touch, but very rough and disagreeable. Philippides also\n mentions the sea-nettle (calling it \u1f00\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c6\u03b7 ) in his Amphiaraus, speaking as follows:\u2014 \n He put before me oysters and sea-nettles and limpets. \n And it is jested upon in the Lysistrata of Aristophanes\u2014- \n But, you most valiant of the oyster race, \n Offspring of that rough dam, the sea-nettle; \n for the \u03c4\u1fc6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 and the \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd are the same. And the word \u03c4\u1fc6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 is here confused in a comic manner with \u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7, a grandmother, and with \u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1, \n a mother. \n ","39":"\n And concerning the rest of the oyster tribe, Diphilus says this: Of the\n thick chem\u00e6, those of smaller size, which have tender flesh, are called\n oysters, and they are good for the stomach, and easily digested. But the thick\n ones, which are called royal chem\u00e6 by some people, and which are also called\n the huge chem\u00e6 are nutritious, slow to be digested, very juicy, good for the\n stomach; and especially do these qualities belong to the larger ones. Of\n tellin\u00e6 there are numbers in Canopus, and they are very common at the place\n where the Nile begins to rise up to the higher ground. And the thinnest of\n these are the royal ones, and they are digest- ible and light, and moreover\n nutritious. But those which are taken in the rivers are the sweetest. Mussels,\n again, are moderately nutritious, and are digestible and diuretic. But the best\n are the Ephesian kind; and of them those which are taken about the end of\n autumn. But the female mussel is smaller than the male, and is sweet and juicy,\n and moreover nutritious. But the solens, as they are called by some, though\n some call them \u03b1\u1f56\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 and \u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, or pipes, and some, too, call\n them \u1f44\u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2, or claws, \n are very juicy, but the juice is bad, and they are very glutinous. And the male\n fish are striped, and not all of one colour; but they are very wholesome for\n people affected with the stone, or with any complaint of the bladder. But the\n female fish is all of one colour, and much sweeter than the male: and they are\n eaten boiled and fried; but they are best of all when roasted on the coals till\n their shells open. And the people who collect this sort of oyster are\n called Solenist\u00e6, as Ph\u00e6nias the Eresian relates in his book which is entitled,\n The Killing of Tyrants by way of Punishment; where he speaks as\n follows:\u2014 Philoxenus, who was called the Solenist, became a tyrant from\n having been a de- magogue. In the beginning he got his livelihood by being a fisherman and a hunter after solens; and so having made a\n little money; he advanced, and got a good property. \u2014 Of the\n periwinkle the white are the most tender, and they have no disagreeable smell,\n and have a good effect on the bowels; but of the black and red kinds the larger\n are exceedingly nice to the taste, especially those that are caught in the\n spring. And as a general rule all of them are good for the stomach, and\n digestible, and good for the bowels, when eaten with cinnamon and\n pepper. Archippus also makes mention of them in his Fishes\u2014 \n With limpets and with sea-urchins, and eschar\u00e6, \n With needle-fishes, and with periwinkles. \n But the fish called balani, or acorns, because of their resemblance to\n the acorn of an oak, differ according to the places where they are found. For the\n Egyptian balani are sweet, tender, delicious to the taste, nutritious, very juicy\n indeed, diuretic, and good for the bowels; but other kinds have a salter taste.\n The fish called \u1f64\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1, or ears, are most nutritious\n when fried; but the pholades are exceedingly pleasant to the taste, but have a bad\n smell, and an injurious juice. \n ","40":"\n \n Sea-urchins are tender, full of pleasant juice, with a strong smell,\n filling, and apt to turn on the stomach; but if eaten with sharp mead, and\n parsley, and mint, they are good for the stomach, and sweet, and full of\n pleasant juice. But the sweet-tasted are the red ones, and the apple-coloured,\n and the thickest, and those which if you scrape their flesh emit a milky\n liquid. But those which are found near Cephalenia and around Icaria, and in the\n Adriatic are\u2014at least many of them are\u2014rather bitter; but those which are taken\n on the rock of Sicily are very aperient to the bowels. But Aristotle\n says that there are many kinds of sea-urchins: one of which is eaten, that,\n namely, in which is found what are called eggs. But the other two kinds are those\n which are called Spatangi, and those which are called Brys\u00e6: and Sopron mentions\n the spatangi, and so does Aristophanes in his Olcades, using the following\n language:\u2014 \n Tearing up, and separating, and licking \n My spatange from the bottom. \n And Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe, speaks o the sea-urchins, and\n says\u2014 \n \n Then came the crabs, sea-urchins, and all fish \n Which know not how to swim in the briny sea, \n But only walk on foot along the bottom. \n And Demetrius the Scepsian, in the twenty-sixth book of his Trojan\n Preparation, says that a Laced\u00e6monian once being invited to a banquet, when some\n sea-urchins were put before him on the table, took one, not knowing the proper\n manner in which it should be eaten, and not attending to those who were in the\n company to see how they ate it. And so he put it in his mouth with the skin or\n shell and all, and began to crush the sea-urchin with, his teeth; and being\n exceedingly disgusted with what he was eating, and not perceiving how to get rid\n of the roughness of the taste, he said, O what nasty food! I will not now\n be so effeminate as to eject it, but I will never take you again. But\n the sea-urchins, and indeed the whole echinus tribe, whether living on land or\n sea, can take care of and protect themselves against those who try to catch them,\n putting out their thorns, like a sort of palisade. And to this Ion the Chian bears\n testimony in his Ph\u0153nix or in his C$aneus, saying\u2014 \n \n But while on land I more approve the conduct \n Of the great lion, than the dirty tricks \n Of the sea-urchin; he, when he perceives \n The impending onset of superior foes, \n Rolls himself up, wrapped in his cloak of thorns, \n Impregnable in bristly panoply. \n \n ","41":"\n \n Of limpets, says Diphilus, \"some are very small, and some are like\n oysters. But they are hard, and give but little juice, and are not very sharp in\n taste. But they have a pleasant flavour, and are easily digested; and when boiled\n they are particularly nice. But the pinn\u00e6 are diuretic, nutritious, not very\n digestible, or manageable. And the ceryces are like them; the necks of which fish\n are good for the stomach, but not very digestible; on which account they are good\n for people with weak stomachs, as being strengthening; but they are difficult to\n be secreted, and they are moderately nutritious. Now the parts of them which are\n called the mecon, which are in the lower part of their bellies, are tender and\n easily digested; on which account they also are good for people who are weak in\n the stomach. But the purple-fish are something between the pinna and the ceryx;\n the necks of which are very juicy, and very pleasant to\n the palate; but the other parts of them are briny, and yet sweet, and easily\n digestible, and mix very well with other food. But oysters are generated in\n rivers, and in lakes, and in the sea. But the best are those which belong to the\n sea, when there is a lake or a river close at hand: for they are full of pleasant\n juice, and are larger and sweeter than others: but those which are near the shore,\n or near rocks, without any mixture of mud or water, are small, harsh, and of\n pungent taste. But the oysters which 'are taken in the spring, and those which are\n taken about the beginning of the summer, are better, and full, and have a sort of\n sea taste, not unmixed with sweetness, and are good for the stomach and easily\n secreted; and when boiled up with mallow, or sorrel, or with fish, or by\n themselves, they are nutritious, and good for the bowels. \n ","42":"\n But Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on Comestibles, says\u2014\"Oysters, and\n cockles, and mussels, and similar things, are not very digestible in their meat,\n because of a sort of saline moisture which there is in them, on which account,\n when eaten raw, they produce an effect on the bowels by reason of their saltness.\n But when boiled they get rid of all, or at all events of most, of their saltness,\n which they infuse into the water which boils them. On which account, the water in\n which any of the oyster tribe are boiled is very apt to have a strong effect in\n disordering the bowels. But the meat of the oysters when boiled, makes a great\n noise when it has been deprived of its moisture. But roasted oysters, when any one\n roasts them cleverly, are very free from any sort of inconvenience; for all the\n evil properties are removed by fire; on which account they are not as indigestible\n as raw ones, and they have all the moisture which is originally contained in them\n dried up; and the is the moisture which has too great an effect in relaxing the\n bowels. But every oyster supplies a moist and somewhat in digestible kind of\n nourishment, and they are not at all good as diuretics. But the sea-nettle, and\n the eggs of sea-urchins, and such things as that, give a moist nourishment, though\n not in any great quantity; but they have a tendency to relax the bowels, and they\n are diuretic. \n ","43":"\n Nicander the Colophonian, in his book on the Farm, enumerates all the following\n kinds of oysters\u2014 \n \n And all the oysters which the foaming brine \n Beneath its vasty bosom cherishes, \n The periwinkle, whilk, pelorias, \n The mussel, and the slimy tellina, \n And the deep shell which makes the pinna's hole. \n And Archestratus says, in his Gastronomy\u2014 \n Aenus has mussels fine, Abydus too \n Is famous for its oysters; Parium produces \n Crabs, the bears of the sea, and Mitylene periwinkles; \n Ambracia in all kinds of fish abounds, \n And the boar-fish sends forth: and in its narrow strait \n Messene cherishes the largest cockles. \n In Ephesus you shall catch chem\u00e6, which are not bad, \n And Chalcedon will give you oysters. But may Jupiter \n Destroy the race of criers, both the fish born in the sea, \n And those wretches which infest the city forum; \n All except one man, for he is a friend of mine, \n Dwelling in Lesbos, abounding in grapes; and his name is Agatho. \n And Philyllius, or whoever is the author of the book called The Cities,\n says, Chem\u00e6, limpets, solens, mussels, pinnas and periwinkles from\n Methymna: but \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was the only\n form of the name for all these fish among the ancients. Cratinus says in his\n Archilochi\u2014 \n Like the pinna or the oyster ( \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Epicharmus says, in his Marriage of Hebe\u2014 \n Oysters which have grown together. \n Where he uses the same form \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. But\n afterwards the form \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd like \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd began to be used. Plato, in his Ph\u00e6drus, says,\n bound together like oysters ( \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd ). And in the tenth book of his Politia, he says,\n oysters ( \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1 ) stuck together; \n oysters ( \u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1 ) and seaweed. But\n the peloris, or giant mussel, were so named from the word \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \n vast. For it is much larger than the cheme, and very\n different from it. But Aristotle says that they are generated in the sand. And Ion\n the Chian mentions the chema, in his Epidemi\u00e6, and perhaps the shell-fish got the\n name of \u03c7\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c7\u1fc3\u03bd\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, from opening their\n mouths.\" \n ","44":"\n But concerning the oysters which are grown in the Indian Ocean; (for it is not\n unreasonable to speak of them, on account of the use of pearls;) Theophrastus\n speaks in his treatise on Precious Stones, and says, But among the stones\n which are much admired is that which is called the pearl, being transparent in\n its character; and they make very expensive necklaces of\n them. They are found in an oyster which is something like the pinna, only less.\n And in size the pearl resembles a large fish's eye. Androsthenes, too,\n in his Voyage along the Coast of India, writes in thee terms\u2014 \"But of strombi, and\n ch\u00e6rini, and other shell-fish, there are many different varieties, and they are\n very different from the shell-fish which we have. And they have the purple-fish,\n and a great multitude of other kinds of oysters. There is also one kind which is\n peculiar to those seas, which the natives call the berberi, from which the\n precious stone called the pearl comes. And this pearl is very expensive in Asia,\n being sold in Persia and the inland countries for its weight in gold. And the\n appearance of the oyster which contains it is much the same as that of the cteis\n oyster, only its shell is not indented, but smooth and shaggy. And it has not two\n ears as the cteis oyster has, but only one. The stone is engendered in the flesh\n of the oyster, just as the measles are in pork. And it is of a very golden colour,\n so as mot easily to be distinguished from gold when it is put by the side of it;\n but some pearls are of a silvery appearance, and some are completely white like\n the eyes of fish. But Chares of Mitylene, in the seventh book of his Histories of\n Alexander, Says\u2014 There is caught in the Indian sea, and also off the coast\n of Armenia, and Persia, and Susiana, and Babylonia, a fish very like an oyster;\n and it is large and oblong, containing within the shell flesh which is\n plentiful and white, and very fragrant, from which the men pick out white bones\n which they call the pearl. And they make of them necklaces and chains for the\n hands and feet, of which the Persians are very fond, as are the Medes and all\n Asiatics, esteeming them as much more valuable than golden ornaments. \n \n ","45":"\n But Isidorus the Characene, in his Description of Parthia, says, that \"in the\n Persian sea there is an island where a great number of pearls are found; on which\n account there are quantities of boats made of rushes all about the island, from\n which men leap into the sea, and die down twenty fathoms, and bring up two shells.\n And they say that when there is a long continuance of thunder-storms, and heavy\n falls of rain, then the pinna produces most young, and then, too, the greatest\n quantity of pearls is engendered, and those, too, of the finest size and quality.\n In the winter the pinna is accustomed to descend into\n chambers at the very bottom of the sea; but in summer they swim about all night\n with their shells open, which they close in the day-time: and as many as stick to\n the crags, or rocks, throw out roots, and remaining fixed there, they generate\n pearls. But they are supported and nourished by something which adheres to their\n flesh: and this also sticks to the mouth of the cockle, having talons and bringing\n it food: and it is something like a little crab, and is called the guardian of the\n pinna. And its flesh penetrates through the centre of the cockleshell, like a\n root: and the pearl being generated close to it, grows through the solid portion\n of the shell, and keeps growing as long as it continues to adhere to the shell.\n But when the flesh gets under the excrescence, and cutting its way onwards, gently\n separates the pearl from the shell, then when the pearl is surrounded by flesh, it\n is no longer nourished so far as to grow at all; but the flesh makes it smoother,\n and more transparent, and more pure. And so, too, the pinna, which lives at the\n bottom, engenders the most transparent sort of pearl; and it produces them also\n very pure and of large size. But that which keeps near the surface, and is\n constantly rising, is of a smaller size and a worse colour, because it is affected\n by the rays of the sun. But those who hunt for pearls are in danger when they\n hastily put their hand into the opening of the shell, for immediately the fish\n closes its shell, and very often their fingers are sawn off; and sometimes they\n die immediately. But all those who put in their hand sideways easily draw off the\n shells from the rock. And Menander makes mention of Emeralds also, in his Little\n Boy\u2013 \n There must be an emerald and a sardonyx. \n And the word for emerald is more correctly written \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, without a \u03c2 . For it is\n derived from the verb \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03c9, to glisten,\n because it is a transparent stone. \n ","46":"\n After this conversation some dishes were set on the table, full of many kinds of\n boiled meat: feet, and head, and ears, and loins; and also entrails, and\n intestines, and tongues; as is the custom at the places which are called boiled\n meat shops at Alexandria. For, O Ulpian, the word \u1f11\u03c6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, a boiled meat shop, is used by Posidippus, in his Little\n Boy. And again, while they were inquiring who had ever named\n any of these dishes, one of the party said, Aristo- phanes mentions entrails as\n things which are eatable, in his Knights\u2014 \n I say that you are selling tripe and paunches \n Which to the revenue no tithe have paid. \n And presently after he adds\u2014 \n Why, my friend, hinder me from washing my paunches, \n And from selling my sausages? Why do you laugh at me? \n And again he says\u2014 \n But I, as soon as I have swallow'd down \n A bullock's paunch, and a dish of pig's tripe, \n And drunk some broth, won't stay to wash my hands, \n But will cut the throats of the orators, and will confuse Nicias. \n And again he says\u2014 \n But the Virgin Goddess born of the mighty Father \n Gives you some boiled meat, extracted from the broth, \n And a slice of paunch, and tripe, and entrails. \n And Cratinus, in his Pluti, mentions jawbones of meat\u2014 \n Fighting for a noble jawbone of beef. \n And Sophocles, in the Amycus, says\u2014 \n And he places on the table tender jawbones. \n And Plato, in his Tim\u00e6us, writes, And he bound up some jawbones\n for them, so as to give the appearance of a whole face. And Xenophon\n says, in his book on Horsemanship, A small jawbone closely pressed. \n But some call it, not \u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd, but \u1f51\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd, spelling the word with a v, saying that it is derived from the word \u1f51\u03c2. Epicharmus also speaks of tripe, \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u1f76 as we call it, but he calls it \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9, having given one of his plays the title of Orya. And\n Aristophanes, in his Clouds, writes\u2014 \n Let them prepare a dish of tripe, for me \n To set before these wise philosophers. \n And Cratinus, in his Pytina, says\u2014 \n How fine, says he, is now this slice of tripe. \n And Eupolis speaks of it also, in his Goats. But Alexis, either in his\n Leucadia or in his Runaways, says\u2014 \n Then came a slice and good large help of tripe. \n And Antiphanes, in his Marriage, says\u2014 \n Having cut out a piece of the middle of the tripe. \n \n \n \n ","47":"\n And as for feet, and ears, and even noses of beasts, they are all mentioned by\n Alexis, in his Crateua or the Physic-seller. And I will adduce a slight proof of\n that presently, which contains a good many of the names about which we are\n inquiring. Theophilus says, in his Pancratiast\u2014 \n \n A. There are here near three minas' weight of\n meat \n Well boiled. \n \n B. What next \n A. There is a calf's nose, and \n A heel of bacon, and four large pig's-feet. \n \n B. A noble dish, by Hercules! \n \n A. And three calves-feet. \n And Anaxilas says, in his Cooks\u2014 \n \n A. I would much rather roast a little fish, \n Than here repeat whole plays of Aeschylus. \n \n B. What do you mean by little fish Do you intend \n To treat your friends as invalids? 'Twere better \n To boil the extremities of eatable animals, \n Their feet and noses. \n And Anaxilas says, in the Circe\u2014 \n For having an unseemly snout of pig, \n My dear Cinesias. \n And in the Calypso\u2014 \n Then I perceived I bore a swine's snout. \n Anaxandrides has mentioned also ears in the Satyrus. And Axionicus says,\n in his Chalcis\u2014 \n I am making soup, \n Putting in well-warm'd fish, and adding to them \n Some scarce half-eaten fragments; and the pettitoes \n Of a young porker, and his ears; the which I sprinkle \n With savoury assaf\u0153tida; and then \n I make the whole into a well-flavour'd sausage, \n A meat most saleable. Then do I add a slice \n Of tender tripe; and a snout soak'd in vinegar. \n So that the guests do all confess, the second day \n Has beaten e'en the wedding-day itself. \n And Aristophanes says, in his Proagon\u2014 \n Wretch that I am, I've eaten tripe, my son: \n How can I bear to see a roasted snout? \n And Pheretrates says, in his Trifles\u2014 \n Is not this plainly now a porker's snout? \n And there is a place which is called \u02bd\u03c0\u0314\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, or Snout, near Stratos, in Aetolia, as Polybius testifies,\n in the sixth book of his Histories. And Stesichorus says, in his Boar Hunting\u2014\n \n To hide the sharpened snout beneath the earth. \n \n And we have already said that the word \u1fe5\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 properly applies only to the snout of a swine; but that it is\n sometimes used for the nose of other animals, Archipphus has proved, saying in\n jest, in his Second Amphitryon, of the human face\u2014 \n And this, too, though you have so long a nose ( \u1fe5\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n And Araros says, in his Adonis\u2014 \n For the god turns his nose towards us. \n \n \n ","48":"\n And Aristophanes makes mention of the extremities of animals as forming a common\n dish, in his Aeolosicon\u2014 \n And of a truth, plague take it, I have boil'd \n Four tender pettitoes for you for dinner. \n And in his Gerytades he says\u2014 \n Pig's pettitoes, and bread, and crabs. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Corinthia\u2014 \n \n A. And then you sacrifice a pig's extremities \n To Venus,\u2014what a joke! \n \n B. That is your ignorance; \n For she in Cyprus is so fond of pigs, \n O master, that she drove away the herd \n Of swine from off the dunghill where they fed, \n And made the cows eat dirt instead of them. \n But Callimachus testifies that, in reality, a pig is sacrificed to Venus;\n or perhaps it is Zenodotus who says so in his Historic Records, writing thus,\n The Argives sacrifice a pig to Venus, and the festival at which this\n takes place is called Hysteria. And Pherecrates says, in his Miners\u2014\n \n But whole pig's feet of the most tender flavour \n Were placed at hand in dishes gaily adorned, \n And boil'd ears, and other extremities. \n And Alexis says, in his Dice Players\u2014 \n But when we had nearly come to an end of breakfast, \n And eaten all the ears and pettitoes. \n And he says again, in his Pannuchis or in his Wool-waavers\u2014 \n This meat is but half roasted, and the fragments \n Are wholly wasted; see this conger eel, \n How badly boiled; and as for the pettitoes, \n They now are wholly spoilt. \n And Pherecrates also speaks of boiled feet, in his Slave-master\u2014 \n \n A. Tell us, I pray you now then, how the supper \n Will be prepared. \n \n B. Undoubtedly I will. \n \n In the first place, a dish of well-minced eel; \n Then cuttle-fish, and lamb, a slice of rich \n Well-made black pudding; then some pig's feet boil'd; \n Some liver, and a loin of mutton, \n And a mighty number of small birds; and cheese \n In honey steep'd, and many a slice of meat. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Parasite\u2014 \n \n A. The well-warm'd legs of pigs.' \n \n B. A noble dish, \n I swear by Vesta. \n \n A. Then some boiled cheese \n Bubbled upon the board. \n And Ecphantides says, in his Satyrs\u2014 \n It is no great hardship, if it must be so, \n To buy and eat the boil'd feet of a pig. \n And Aristophanes speaks of tongue as a dish, in his Tryers, ill the\n following words\u2014 \n I've had anchovies quite enough; for I \n Am stretch'd almost to bursting while I eat \n Such rich and luscious food. But bring me something \n Which shall take off the taste of all these dainties. \n Bring me some liver, or a good large slice \n Of a young goat. And if you can't get that, \n Let me at least have a rib or a tongue, \n Or else the spleen, or entrails, or the tripe \n Of a young porker in last autumn born; \n And with it some hot rolls. \n \n \n ","49":"\n Now when all this conversation had taken place on these subjects, the physicians\n who were present would not depart without taking their share in it. For\n Dionysiocles said, Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his book about Comestibles, has\n said, The head and feet of a pig have not a great deal in them which is\n rich and nutritious. And Leonidas writes, \"Demon, in the fourth book of\n his Attica, says that Thym\u0153tes, his younger brother, slew Apheidas, who was king\n of Athens, he himself being a bastard, and usurped the kingdom. And in his time,\n Melanthus the Messenian was banished from his country, and consulted the Pythia as\n to where he should dwell: and she said wherever he was first honoured by gifts of\n hospitality, when men set before him feet and a head for supper. And this happened\n to him at Eleusis; for as the priestesses happened at the time to be solemnizing\n one of their national festivals, and to have con- sumed all\n the meat, and as nothing but the head and feet of the victim were left, they sent\n them to Melanthius. \n ","50":"\n Then a paunch was brought in, which may be looked upon as a sort of metropolis, and the\n mother of the sons of Hippocrates, whom I know to have been turned into ridicule\n by the comic poets on account of their swinish disposition. And Ulpian, looking\n upon it, said,\u2014Come now, my friends, whom does the paunch lie with? For we have\n now been minding the belly long enough, and it is time for us now to have some\n real conversation. And as for these cynics, I bid them be silent, now that they\n have eaten abundantly, unless they like to gnaw some of the cheeks, and heads, and\n bones, which no one will grudge their enjoying like dogs, as they are; for that is\n what they are, and what they are proud of being called. \n The remnants to the dogs they're wont to throw, \n Euripides says, in his Cretan Women. For they wish to eat and drink\n everything, never considering what the divine Plato says in his Protagoras,\n That disputing about poetry, is like banquets of low and insignificant\n persons. For they, because they are unable in their drinking parties to amuse\n one another by their own talents, and by their own voices and conversation, by\n reason of their ignorance and stupidity, make female flute-players of great\n consequence, hiring at a high price sounds which they cannot utter themselves,\n I mean the music of flutes, and by means of this music they are able to get on\n with one another. But where the guests are gentlemanly, and accomplished, and\n well educated, you will not see any flute-playing women, or dancing women, or\n female harpers, but they are able themselves to pass the time with one another\n agreeably, without all this nonsense and trifling, by means of their own\n voices, speaking and hearing one another in turn with all decency, even if they\n drink a great deal of wine. And this is what all you Cynics do, O\n Cynulcus; you drink, or rather you get drunk, and then, like flute-players and\n dancing-women, you prevent all the pleasure of conversation:\n living, to use the words of the same Plato which he utters in\n his Philebus, not the life of a man, but of some mollusk, or of some other\n marine animal which has life in a shell-encased body. \n \n \n ","51":"\n And Cynulcus, being very angry, said,\u2014You glutton of a man, whose god is your\n belly, you know nothing else yourself, nor are you able to keep up an\n uninterrupted conversation, nor to recollect any history, nor to begin anything\n which may tend to throw a charm on any discussion. But you have been wasting all\n the time with questions of this sort, Is there such and such a statement?\n Is there not? Has such and such a thing been said? Has it not been\n said? And you attack and examine closely everything which occurs in\n anything which is said, collecting all your thorns\u2014living continually \n As if among thistles, or plants of rough borage\u2014- \n never collecting any sweet flowers. Are you not the person who call that\n which is called by the Romans strena, being so named in\n accordance with some national tradition, and which is accustomed to be given to\n friends, epinomis? And if you do this in imitation of\n Plato, we should be glad to learn it; but if you find that any one of the ancients\n has ever spoken in such a manner, tell us who it is who has. For I know that there\n is some part of a trireme which is called epinomis, as Apollonius states in his\n treatise on what relates to Triremes. Are not you the man who called your new\n stout cloak, which had never yet been used by you, (for the proper name of it, my\n friend, is really \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, ) useless?\n saying\u2014 My slave Leucus, give me that useless cloak. And once\n going to the bath, did not you say to a man who asked you, Whither now? I am\n going, said you, \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (pronouncing the word\n as if it meant to kill yourself rather than to bathe). And that very day your beautiful garment was\n purloined from you by some bath robbers; so that there was great laughter in the\n bath, at this useless cloak being hunted for. At another time too, O my dear\n friends, (for the plain truth shall be told you,) he tripped against a stone and\n dislocated his knees. And when he was cured he again came into public: and when\n men asked him, What is the matter, O Ulpian? he said it was a black eye. And I\n (for I was with him at the time) being then unable to restrain my laughter, got\n anointed under the eyes with some thick ointment by a physician who was a friend\n of mine, and then said to those who asked me, What is the matter with you, that I\n had hurt my leg. \n ","52":"\n There is also another imitator of the same wisdom, Pompeianus\n the Philadelphian; a man not destitute of shrewdness, but still a terrible\n wordcatcher: and he, conversing with his servant, calling him by name with a loud\n voice, said\u2014 Strombichides, bring me to the gymnasium those intolerable\n slippers (he used the word \u1f00\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, intending\n it to mean what he had never worn) and my useless (he\n used the word \u1f04\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, by which he meant which he had \n never used) cloak. For I, as soon as I have bound up my\n beard, shall address my friends. For I have got some roast fish. And bring me a\n cruet of oil. For first of all we will be crushed (he used the word \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd, meaning to say we\n will rub ourselves well), and then we will be utterly destroyed (his\n word was \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd, and he meant to say we will have a bath ). And this same sophist, in\n the month of February, as the Romans call it, (and Juba the Mauritanian says that\n this month has its name from the terrors caused by the spirits under\n the earth, and from the means used to get rid of those fears, at which season the\n greatest severity of winter occurs, and it is the custom of them to offer\n libations for many days to those who are dead:) in the month of February, I say,\n he said to one of his friends\u2014 It is a long time since you have seen me,\n because of the heat. And when the festival of the Panathen\u00e6a was being\n celebrated, during which the courts of justice do not assemble, he said\u2014\n This is the birthday of the virgin goddess Minerva, (but he\n pronounced the word \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, as if he had meant\n of \n the cock of Minerva,) \n and this day is unjust, (for he called it\n \u1f04\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, though he meant the word to have the\n sense of being a holiday for the courts of law). And once\n he called a companion of ours who came back from Delphi without having received an\n answer from the god, \u1f04\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, (which never means\n anything but useless, but he used the word for unanswered). And once when he was making a public display\n of his eloquence, and going through a long panegyric on the Queen of cities, he\n said, Most admirable is the Roman dominion, and \u1f00\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (he meant irresistible ). \n \n ","53":"\n Such now, my friends, are Ulpian's companions, the sophists; men who call even the\n thing which the Romans call miliarium, that is to say, a vessel designed to\n prepare boiling water in, \u1f30\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03c2, an\n oven-kettle; being manufac- turers of many names, and far outrunning by many\n para-sangs the Sicilian Dionysius: who called a virgin \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (from \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 and \u1f00\u03bd\u1f74\u03c1 ), because she is waiting for a husband; and a\n pillar \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (from \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ), because it remains\n and is strong. And a javelin he called \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \n because ( \u1f04\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ) it is thrown against\n something; and mouse-holes he called \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, \n mysteries, (from \u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03bc\u1fe6\u03c2 because they keep\n the mice. And Athanis, in the first book of his History of the Affairs of Sicily,\n says that the same Dionysius gave an ox the name of \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 ; and a pig he called \u1f34\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 .\n And Alexarchus was a man of the same sort, the brother of Cassander, who was king\n of Macedonia, who built the city called Uranopolis. And Heraclides Lembus speaks\n concerning him in the seventh book of his Histories, and says, Alexarchus,\n who founded the city Uranopolis, imported many peculiar words and forms of\n speaking into the language: calling a cock \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03b1\u03c2, or he that crows in the morn; \n and a barber \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, or one who cuts men; and a drachm he called \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2, \n a piece of silver; and a ch\u0153nix he called, \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u1f76\u03c2, \n what feeds a man for a day; and a herald he called\n \u1f00\u03c0\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \n a bawler.

And Sophocles the poet, in some one of his works,\n called a guardian a bolt, saying\u2014 \n Be of good cheer, I am a mighty bolt \n To keep this fear away from you. \n And, in another place, he has given an anchor the name of \u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u1f70\u03c2 or the holder, because it\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9, \n holds the ship\u2014 \n And the sailors let out the holder of the ship. \n And Demades the orator said that Aegina was the eyesore of the\n Peir\u00e6us, and that Samos was a fragment broken off from the\n city.

But I will postpone any proof of this statement\n until I have paid you the blows I owe you. \n ","56":"\n And so when every one had been well amused by these jokes,\u2014But, said Ulpian, I\n will also give you now the statement about paunches which I promised you. For\n Alexis, in his play which is entitled Ponticus, jesting in a comic manner, says\n that Callimedon the orator, who was surnamed the Crab (and he was one of those who\n took part in the affairs of the state in the time of Demosthenes the orator)-\n \n Every one is willing to die for his country ( \u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ): \n And for a boiled paunch ( \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 )\n Callimedon, \n The dauntless crab, would very probably \n Dare to encounter death. \n And Callimedon was a man very notorious for his fondness for\n dainties. \n And Antiphanes also speaks of launches in his Philometor, using these words\u2014\n \n While the wood has pith in it ( \u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) it\n puts forth shoots. \n There is a metropolis but no patropolis. \n \n Some men sell paunches ( \u03bc\u1fc6\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 ), a delicious\n food. \n Metras, the Chian, is dear to the people. \n And Euphron says in his Paradidomena\u2014 \n But my master having prepared a paunch \n Set it before Callimedon; and when he ate it \n It made him leap with joy; from which he earn'd \n The name of crab. \n \n And Dioxippus in his Antipornoboscus\u2014 \n What food doth he delight in! Dainty is he! \n Most dainty in his eating, paunches, sausages! \n And in his Historiographer, he says\u2014 \n Amphides burst in the porch and made himself a way in; \n Holding up two paunches fine, See for what I'm paying, \n Said he, and send me all you have, or all that you can find me. \n And Eubulus says in his Deucalion\u2014 \n Liver, and tripe, and entrails, aye, and paunches. \n \n \n ","57":"\n But Lynceus the Samian, the friend of Theophrastus, was acquainted with the use of\n paunches when eaten with Cyrenaic sauce. And accordingly, writing an account of\n the Banquet of Ptolemy, he says:\u2014 A certain paunch having been brought round\n in vinegar and sauce. Antiphanes, too, mentions this sauce in his\n Unhappy Lovers, speaking of Cyrene\u2014 \n I sail back to the self-same harbour whence \n We previously were torn; and bid farewell \n To all my horses, friends, and assaf\u0153tida, \n And two horse chariots, and to cabbages, \n And single-horses, and to salads green, \n And fevers, and rich sauces. \n And how much better a paunch of a castrated animal is, Hipparchus, who\n wrote the book called The Aegyptian Iliad, tells us in the following words\u2014 \n But above all I do delight in dishes \n Of paunches and of tripe from gelded beasts, \n And love a fragrant pig within the oven. \n And Sopater says in his Hippolytus\u2014 \n But like a beauteous paunch of gelded pig \n Well boil'd and white, and basted with rich cheese. \n And in his Physiologus he says\u2014 \n 'Tis not a well boil'd slice of paunch of pig \n Holding within a sharp and biting gravy. \n And in his Silph\u00e6 he says\u2014 \n That you may eat a slice of boil'd pig's paunch, \n Dipping it in a bitter sauce of rue. \n \n \n ","58":"\n But the ancients were not acquainted with the fashion of bringing on paunches, or\n lettuces, or anything of the sort, before dinner, as is done now. At all events\n Archestratus, the inventor of made dishes, as he calls himself, says that pledges in drinking, and the use of ointments, are introduced\n after supper\u2014 \n And always at the banquet crown your head \n With flowing wreaths of varied scent and hue, \n Culling the treasures of the happy earth; \n And steep your hair in rich and reeking odours, \n And all day long pour holy frankincense \n And myrrh, the fragrant fruit of Syria, \n On the slow slumb'ring ashes of the fire: \n Then, when you drink, let slaves these luxuries bring\u2014 \n Tripe, and the boiled paunch of well-fed swine, \n Well soak'd in cummin juice and vinegar, \n And sharp, strong-smelling assaf\u0153tida; \n Taste, too, the tender well-roast birds, and game, \n Whate'er may be in season. But despise \n The rude uncivilized Sicilian mode, \n Where men do nought but drink like troops of frogs, \n And eat no solid seasoning. Avoid them. \n And seek the meats which I enjoin thee here. \n All other foods are only signs and proofs \n Of wretched poverty: the green boil'd vetch, \n And beans, and apples, and dried drums of figs. \n But praise the cheesecakes which from Athens come; \n And if there are none, still of any country \n Cheesecakes are to be eaten; also ask \n For Attic Honey, the feast's crowning dish\u2014 \n For that it is which makes a banquet noble. \n Thus should a free man live, or else descend \n Beneath the earth, and court the deadly realms \n Of Tartarus, buried deep beneath the earth \n Innumerable fathoms. \n \n \n But Lynceus, describing the banquet given by Lamia, the female flute-player, when\n she entertained Demetrius Poliorcetes, represents the guests the moment they come\n to the banquet as eating all sorts of fish and meat; and in the same way, when\n speaking of the feast given by Antigonus the king, when celebrating the\n Aphrodisiac festival, and also one given by King Ptolemy, he speaks of fish as the\n first course; and then meat. \n ","59":"\n But one may well wonder at Archestratus, who has given us such admirable\n suggestions and injunctions, and who was a guide in the matter of pleasure to the\n philosopher Epicurus, when he counsels us wisely, in a manner equal to that of the\n bard of Ascra, that we\n ought not to mind some people, but only attend to him; and he bids us eat such and such things, differing in no respect from the cook in\n Damoxenus the comic writer, who says in his Syntrophi\u2014 \n \n A. You see me here a most attentive pupil \n Of Epicurus, wisest of the Greeks, \n From whom in two years and ten months or less, \n I scraped together four good Attic talents. \n \n B. What do you mean by this I pray thee, tell\n me, \n Was he a cook, my master That is news. \n \n A. Ye gods! and what a cook! Believe me, nature \n Is the beginning and the only source \n Of all true wisdom. And there is no art \n At which men labour, which contains more wisdom. \n So this our art is easy to the man \n Who has drunk deep of nature's principles; \n They are his guides: and therefore, when you see \n A cook who is no scholar, nor has read \n The subtle lessons of Democritus, \n (Aye and he must remember them besides,) \n Laugh at him as an ass; and if you hire one \n Who knows not Epicurus and his rules, \n Discharge him straightway. For a cook must know, \n (I speak the words of sober truth, my friend,) \n How great the difference is in summer time \n Between the glaucisk of the winter-season; \n He must know all the fish the Pleiades \n Bring to us at their setting; what the solstice, \n Winter and summer, gives us eatable\u2014 \n For all the changes and the revolutions \n Are fraught with countless evil to mankind, \n Such changes do they cause in all their food. \n Dost thou not understand me? And remember, \n Whatever is in season must be good. \n \n B. How few observe these rules. \n \n A. From this neglect \n Come spasms, and the flatulence which ill \n Beseems a politic guest;-but all the food \n I give my parties, wholesome is, and good, \n Digestible and free from flatulence. \n Therefore its juice is easily dissolved, \n And penetrates the entire body's pores. \n \n B. Juice, say you? This is not known to\n Democritus. \n \n A. But all meats out of season make the eater \n Diseased in his joints. \n B. You seem to me, \n To have studied too the art of medicine. \n \n A. No doubt, and so does every one who seeks \n Acquaintance with his nature's mysteries. \n But see now, I do beg you by the gods, \n How ignorant the present race of cooks are. \n When thus you find them ignorant of the smell \n \n Of all the varied dishes which they dress, \n And pounding sesame in all their sauce. \n What can be bad enough for such sad blunderers \n \n B. You seem to speak as any oracle. \n \n A. What good can e'er arise, where every quality \n Is jumbled with its opposite in kind, \n How different so ever both may be? \n Now to discern these things is art and skill, \n Not to wash dishes nor to smell of smoke. \n For I do never enter a strange cook-shop, \n But sit within such a distance as enables \n My eyes to comprehend what is within. \n My friends, too, do the same; I tell them all \n The causes and results. This bit is sour, \n Away with it; the man is not a cook, \n Though he perhaps may be a music master: \n Put in some fire; keep an equal heat. \n The first dish scarcely suits the rest. Do you \n Not see the form of th' art? \n \n B. O, great Apollo! \n \n A. What does this seem to you? \n \n B. Pure skill; high art. \n \n A. Then I no dishes place before my guests \n At random; but while all things correspond \n I regulate the whole, and will divide \n The whole as best may suit, in fours, or fives; \n And will consult each separate division- \n And satisfy each party. Then again, \n I stand afar off and directions give; \n Whence bring you that? what shall you mix with this? \n See how discordant those two dishes are! \n Take care and shun such blunders. That will do. \n Thus Epicurus did arrange his pleasures. \n Thus wisely did he eat. He, only wise, \n Saw what was good and what its nature was. \n The Stoics seek in vain for such discoveries, \n And know not good nor what the nature may be \n Of good; and so they have it not; nor know \n How to impart it to their friends and guests. \n Enough of this. Do'st not agree with me? \n \n B. Indeed i do, all things are plain to me. \n \n \n ","60":"\n Plato, too, in his Joint Deceiver, introduces the father of a young man in great\n indignation, on the ground that his son's principles and way of living have been\n injured by his tutor; and he says\u2014 \n \n A. You now have been the ruin of my son, \n You wretch, you have persuaded him t' embark \n In a course of life quite foreign to his habits \n And former inclinations. You have taught him \n To drink i' th' morning, quite beyond his wont. \n \n \n B. Do you blame me that he has learnt to live? \n \n A. Call you this living? \n \n B. So the wise do say: \n At all events the all wise Epicurus \n Tells us that pleasure is the only good. \n \n A. No doubt, and nobody can entertain \n A different opinion. To live well \n Must be to rightly live; is it not so? \n Tell me, I pray thee, hast thou ever seen \n Any philosopher confused with wine? \n Or overtaken with those joys of yours \n \n B. Aye, all of them. Those who lift up their\n brows, \n Who look most solemn in the promenades, \n And in their daily conversation, \n Who turn their eyes away in high disdain \n If you put plaice or turbot on their board, \n Know for all that the fish's daintiest part. \n Seek out the head, the fins; the sound, the roe, \n And make men marvel at their gluttony. \n \n \n ","61":"\n And in Antiphanes, in his Soldier or in his Tycho, a man is introduced delivering\n rules in this way, saying\u2014 \n Whoever is a mortal man, and thinks \n This life has any sure possession, \n Is woefully deceived. For either taxes \n Take off his property; or he goes to law \n And loses all he seeks, and all he has: \n Or else he's made a magistrate, and bears \n The losses they are subject to; or else \n The people bid him a choragus be, \n And furnish golden garments for a chorus; \n And wear but rags himself. Or as a captain \n Of some tall ship, he hangs himself; or else \n Takes the command, and then is taken prisoner: \n Or else, both waking and in soundest sleep, \n He's helpless, pillaged by his own domestics. \n Nothing is sure, save what a man can eat, \n And treats himself to day by day. Nor then, \n Is even this too sure. For guests drop in \n To eat what you have order'd for yourself. \n So not until you've got it 'twixt your teeth \n Ought you to think that e'en your dinner's safe. \n And he says the same in his Hydria. \n ","62":"\n Now if any one, my friends, were to consider this, he would naturally and\n reasonably praise the honest Chrysippus, who examined accurately into the nature\n of Epicurus's philosophy, and said, That the Gastrology of Archestratus was\n the metropolis of his philosophy; which all the epicures of\n philosophers call the Theogony, as it were, that beautiful \n epic poem; to whom Theognetus, in his Phasma or in his Miser, says\u2014 \n My man, you will destroy me in this way; \n For you are ill and surfeited with all \n The divers arguments of all the Stoics. \n \"Gold is no part of man, mere passing rime, \n Wisdom's his real wealth, solid like ice; \n No one who has it ever loses it.\" \n Oh! wretched that I am; what cruel fate \n Has lodged me here with this philosopher? \n Wretch, you have learnt a most perverted learning; \n Your books have turn'd your whole life upside down; \n Buried in deep philosophy you talk \n Of earth and heaven, both of which care little \n For you and all your arguments. \n \n \n ","63":"\n While Ulpian was continuing to talk in this way, the servants came in bearing on\n some dishes some crabs bigger than Callimedon, the orator, who, because he was so\n very fond of this food was himself called the Crab. Accordingly, Alexis, in his\n Dorcis, or the Flatterer, (as also others of the comic poets do,) hands him down,\n as a general rule, as being most devoted to fish, saying\u2014 \n It has been voted by the fish-sellers, \n To raise a brazen statue to Callimedon \n At the Panathenaic festival \n In the midst of the fish-market; and the statue \n Shall in his right hand hold a roasted crab, \n As being the sole patron of their trade, \n Which other men neglect and seek to crush. \n \n \n But the taste of the crab is one which many people have been very much devoted to;\n as may be shown by many passages in different comedies; but at present\n Aristophanes will suffice, who in the Thesmophoriazus\u00e6 speaks as follows\u2014 \n \n A. Has any fish been bought? a cuttle-fish, \n Or a broad squill, or else a polypus; \n Or roasted mullet, or perhaps some beet-root? \n \n B. Indeed there was not. \n \n A. Or a roach or dace? \n \n B. Nothing of such a sort? \n \n A. Was there no black-pudding, \n Nor tripe, nor sausage, nor boar's liver fried, \n No honeycomb, no paunch of pig, no eel, \n No mighty crab, with which you might recruit \n The strength of women wearied with long toil \n But by broad squills he must have meant what we call astaci, a kind of\n crab which Philyllius mentions in his Cities. And\n Archestratus, in that famous poem of his where he never once mentions the crab by\n the name of \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, does speak of the \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2. As he does also in the following passage\u2014\n \n But passing over trifles, buy an astacus, \n Which has long hands and heavy too, but feet \n Of delicate smallness, and which slowly walks \n Over the earth's face. A goodly troop there are \n Of such, and those of finest flavour, where \n The isles of Lipara do gem the ocean: \n And many lie in the broad Hellespont. \n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, shows plainly that the \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 spoken of by Archestratus is the same as the\n \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, speaking as follows\u2014 \n There are astaci and colybdaen\u00e6, both equipp'd \n With little feet and long hands, both coming under \n The name of \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n \n \n ","64":"\n But the carabi, and astaci, and also carides or squills, are each a distinct\n genus.

The coracus, the astacus, the\n nymphe, the arctus, the carcinus, and the pagurus. And Diocles the Carystian says,\n Carides, carcini, carabi, and astaci, are pleasant to the taste and\n diuretic. And Epicharmus has also mentioned the colybd\u00e6na in the lines\n I have quoted above; which Nicander calls the beauty of the sea; but Heraclides in\n his Cookery Book gives that name to the caris. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of\n his Parts of Animals, says, \"Of soft-shelled animals the carabi, the astaci, the\n carides, and others of the same sort, are propagated like quadrupeds; and they\n breed at the beginning of spring; as indeed is no secret to anybody; but at times\n they breed when the fig begins to ripen. \n Now carabi are found in rough and rocky places; but astaci in smooth ground;\n neither kind in muddy places: on which account there are astaci produced in the\n Hellespont and about Thasos; and carabi off Cape Sigeum and Mount Athos. But the\n whole race of crabs is long-lived. But Theophrastus, in his book on Animals who\n dive in Holes, says that the astaci and carabi and carides\n all cast off their old age. \n ","65":"\n But concerning carides, Ephorus mentions in his first book that there is a city\n called Carides near the island of Chios; and he says that it was founded by Macar\n and those of his companions who were saved out of the deluge which happened in the\n time of Deucalion; and that to this very day the place is called Carides. But\n Archestratus, the inventor of made dishes, gives these recommendations\u2014 \n But if you ever come to Iasus, \n A city of the Carians, you shall have \n A cars of huge size, but rare to buy. \n Many there are where Macedon is wash'd \n By the deep sea, and in Ambracia's gulf. \n But Araros in his Campylion has used the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b1 with the penultima circumflexed and long\u2014 \n The strangely bent carides did leap forth \n Like dolphins into the rope-woven vessel. \n And Eubulus says in his Orthane\u2014 \n Iput a carid ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b1 ) down and took it up\n again. \n Anaxandrides says in his Lycurgus\u2014 \n And he plays with little carids ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ), \n And little partridges, and little lettuces; \n And little sparrows, and with little cups, \n And little scindaries, and little gudgeons. \n And the same poet says in his Pandarus\u2014 \n If you don't stoop, my friend, you'll upright be. \n But she is like a carid ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c9 ) in her\n person; \n Bent out, and like an anchor standing firm. \n And in his Cerkios he says\u2014 \n I'll make them redder than a roasted carid ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n And Eubulus says in his Grandmothers\u2014 \n And carids ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) of the humpback'd\n sort. \n And Ophelion says in his Call\u00e6schrus\u2014 \n There lay the crooked carids ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) on\n dry ground. \n And in his Ialemus we find\u2014 \n And then they danced as crooked limbed carides ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) \n Dance on the glowing embers. \n But Eupolis, in his Goats, uses the word with the penultima short,\n ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9???\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ), thus\u2014 \n Once in Ph\u00e6acia I ate carides ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n \n And again in his People he says\u2014 \n Having the face of a tough thick-skinn'd carid ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n \n \n ","66":"\n Now the carides were so called from the word \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1, \n head.

And the lion is\n larger than the astacus; and the carabi are called also graps\u00e6i; but they are\n more fleshy than the carcini; but the carcinus is heavy and\n indigestible. But Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on\n Comestibles, says, Carabi and carcini and carides, and such like; these are\n all indigestible, but still not nearly so much so as other fish: and they are\n better and more wholesome roast than boiled. But Sophron in his Gyn\u00e6cea\n calls carides courides, saying\u2014 \n Behold the dainty courides, my friend. \n And see these lobsters; see how red they are, \n How smooth and glossy is their hair and coats. \n And Epicharmus in his Land and Sea says\u2014 \n And red-skinned courides. \n And in his Logos and Logina he spells the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 with an \u03c9 \u2014 \n Oily anchovies, crooked corides. \n And Simonides says\u2014 \n Beet-root with thunnies, and with gudgeons corides. \n \n \n ","67":"\n After this conversation there were brought in some dishes of fried liver; wrapped\n up in what is called the caul, or \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bf\u03bd, which\n Philet\u00e6rus in his Tereus calls \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd.

So as they were thus prepared for the discussion, Myrtilus said, The\n word \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 is used by Epicharmus in the Bacch\u00e6\u2014\n \n And wrapping up the bread in the \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n And again, in his Theari, he says\u2014 \n Around the loins and \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. \n \n And Ion of Chios, in his Epidemi\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Having wrapp'd it up in the \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. \n \n \n \n So here, my friend Ulpian, you have plenty of authority for your \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. And you may wrap yourself up in it and burn\n yourself, and so release us from all these investigations. And, indeed, you ought\n to bear your own testimony to a liver having been prepared in this way; since you\n mentioned before, when we were inquiring about ears and feet, what Alexis said in\n his Crateua, or the Female Druggist. And the whole quotation is serviceable for\n many purposes, and since you at the moment fail to recollect it, I myself will\n repeat it to you. \n The Comedian says this\u2014 \n ","68":"\n \n \n First, then, I saw a man whose name was Nereus; \n With noble oysters laden; an aged man, \n And clad in brown sea-weed. I took the oysters \n And eke some fine sea-urchins; a good prelude \n To a rich banquet daintily supplied. \n When they were done, next came some little fish, \n Still quivering as if they felt a fear \n Of what should now befal them. Courage, said I, \n My little friends, and fear no harm from me; \n And to spare them I bought a large flat glaucus. \n Then a torpedo came; for it did strike me, \n That even if my wife should chance to touch it \n She from its shock would surely take no harm. \n So for my frying-pan I've soles and plaice, \n Carides, gudgeons, perch, and spars, and eels, \n A dish more varied than a peacock's tail. \n Slices of meat, and feet, and snouts, and ears, \n And a pig's liver neatly wrapp'd in caul. \n For by itself it looks too coarse and livid. \n No cook shall touch or e'er behold these dainties; \n He would destroy them all. I'll manage them \n Myself; with skill and varied art the sauce \n I will compound, in such a tasty way \n That all the guests shall plunge their very teeth \n \n Into the dish for joy and eagerness; \n And the recipes and different modes of dressing \n I am prepared to teach the world for nothing, \n If men are only wise enough to learn. \n \n \n ","69":"\n But that it was the fashion for liver to be wrapped up in a caul is stated by\n Hegesander the Delphian in his Memorials, where he says that Metanira the\n courtesan, having got a piece of the lungs of the animal in the liver which was\n thus wrapped up, as soon as she had unfolded the outer coat of fat and seen it,\n cried out\u2014 \n I am undone, the tunic's treacherous folds \n Have now entangled me to my destruction. \n And perhaps it was because of its being in this state that Crobylus the\n comic poet called the liver modest; as Alexis also does in his Pseudypobolem\u00e6us,\n speaking as follows\u2014 Take the stiff feelers of the polypus, And in them you shall\n find some modest liver, And cutlets of wild goats, which you shall eat. But\n Aristophanes uses the diminutive form \u1f21\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd in\n his Tagenist\u00e6, and so does Alc\u00e6us in the Pal\u00e6stra, and Eubulus in his Deucalion.\n And the first letter of \u1f27\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1 and \u1f21\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd must be aspirated. For a synal\u0153pha is used by\n Archilochus with the aspirate; when he says\u2014 \n For you do seem to have no gall \u1f10\u03c6\u02bc \u1f25\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \n ( in your liver ). \n There is also a fish which is called \u1f25\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which Eubulus himself mentions in his Laced\u00e6monians or Leda,\n and says that it has no gall in it\u2014 \n You thought that I'd no gall; but spoke to me \n As if I'd been a \u1f25\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 : but I \n Am rather one of the melampyx class. \n But Hegesander, in his Memorials, says, that the hepatos has in its head\n two stones, like pearls in brilliancy and colour, and in shape something like a\n turbot. \n ","70":"\n But Alexis speaks of fried fish in his Demetrius, as he does also in the\n before-mentioned play. And Eubulus says, in his Orthane\u2014 \n Now each fair woman walks about the streets, \n Fond of fried fish and stout Triballian youths. \n Then there is beet-root and canary-grass \n Mix'd up in forcemeat with the paunch of lamb, \n Which leaps within one's stomach like a colt \n Scarce broken to the yoke. Meanwhile the bellows \n \n Waken the watchful hounds of Vulcan's pack, \n And stir the frying-pan with vapours warm. \n The fragrant steam straight rises to the nose, \n And fills the sense with odours. \n Then comes the daughter of the bounteous Ceres, \n Fair wheaten flour, duly mash'd, and press'd \n Within the hollow of the gaping jaws, \n Which like the trireme's hasty shock comes on, \n The fair forerunner of a sumptuous feast. \n I have also eaten cuttle-fish fried. But Nicostratus or Philet\u00e6rus says,\n in the Antyllus\u2014I never again will venture to eat cuttle-fish which has been\n dressed in a frying-pan. But Hegemon, in his Philinna, introduces men eating the\n roe fried, saying\u2014 \n Go quickly, buy of them that polypus, \n And fry the roe, and give it us to eat. \n \n \n ","71":"\n Ulpian was not pleased at this; and being much vexed, he looked at us, and\n repeating these iambics from the Orthanus of Eubulus, said\u2014 \n How well has Myrtilus, cursed by the gods, \n Come now to shipwreck on this frying-pan. \n For certainly I well know that he never ate any of these things at his\n own expense; and I heard as much from one of his own servants, who once quoted me\n these iambics from the Pornoboscus of Eubulus\u2014 \n My master comes from Thessaly; a man \n Of temper stern; wealthy, but covetous; \n A wicked man; a glutton; fond of dainties, \n Yet sparing to bestow a farthing on them. \n But as the young man was well educated, and that not by Myrtilus, but by\n some one else, when I asked him how he fell in with the young Myrtilus, he\n repeated to me these lines from the Neottis of Antiphanes\u2014 \n While still a boy, bearing my sister company, \n I came to Athens, by some merchant brought; \n For Syria was my birthplace. There that merchant \n Saw us when we were both put up for sale, \n And bought us, driving a most stingy bargain. \n No man could e'er in wickedness surpass him; \n So miserly, that nothing except thyme \n Was ever bought by him for food, not e'en \n So much as might have fed Pythagoras. \n \n \n ","72":"\n While Ulpian went on jesting in this manner, Cynulcus cried out\u2014I want some bread;\n and when I say bread ( \u1f04\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ) \n I do not mean Artus king of the Messapians, the Messapians, I mean, in Iapygia,\n concerning whom there is a treatise among Polemo's works. And Thucydides also\n mentions him, in his seventh book, and Demetrius the comic writer speaks of him in\n the drama entitled Sicily, using the following language\u2014 \n From thence, borne on by the south wind, we came \n Across the sea to the Italian shore, \n Where the Messapians dwelt; and Artus there, \n The monarch of the land, received us kindly, \n A great and noble host for foreigners. \n But this is not the time for speaking of that Artus, but of the other,\n which was discovered by Ceres, surnamed Sito (food), and Simalis. For those are\n the names under which the Goddess is worshipped by the Syracusans, as Polemo\n himself reports in his book about Morychus. But in the first book of his treatise\n addressed to Tim\u00e6us, he says, that in Scolus, a city of B\u0153otia, statues are\n erected to Megalartus (the God or Goddess of great bread), and to Megalomazus (the\n God or Goddess of abundant corn). So when the loaves were brought, and 'on them a\n great quantity of all kinds of food, looking at them, he said\u2014 \n What numerous nets and snares are set by men \n To catch the helpless loaves; \n as Alexis says in his play, The Girl sent to the Well. And so now let us\n say something about bread. \n ","73":"\n But Pontianus anticipating him, said; Tryphon of Alexandria, in the book entitled\n the Treatise on Plants, mentions several kinds of loaves; if I can remember them\n accurately, the leavened loaf, the unleavened loaf, the loaf made of the best\n wheaten flour, the loaf made of groats, the loaf made of remnants (and this he\n says is more digestible than that which is made only of the best flour), the loaf\n made of rye, the loaf made of acorns, the loaf made of millet. The loaf made of\n groats, said he, is made of oaten groats, for groats are not made of barley. And\n from a peculiar way of baking or roasting it, there is a loaf called ipnites (or\n the oven loaf) which Timocles mentions in his Sham Robbers, where he says\u2014 \n And seeing there a tray before me full \n Of smoking oven-loaves, I took and ate them. \n \n There is another kind called escharites (or the hearth-loaf),\n and this is mentioned by Antidotus in the Protohorus\u2014 \n I took the hot hearth-loaves, how could I help it? \n And dipp'd them in sweet sauce, and then I at them. \n And Crobylus says, in his Strangled Man\u2014 \n I took a platter of hot clean hearth-loaves. \n And Lynceus the Samian, in his letter to Diagoras, comparing the eatables\n in vogue at Athens with those which were used at Rhodes, says\u2014 And moreover,\n while they talk a great deal about their bread which is to be got in the\n market, the Rhodians at the beginning and middle of dinner put loaves on the\n table which are not at all inferior to them; but when they have given over\n eating and are satisfied, then they introduce a most agreeable dish, which is\n called the hearth-loaf, the best of all loaves; which is made of sweet things,\n and compounded so as to be very soft, and it is made up with such an admirable\n harmony of all the ingredients as to have a most excellent effect; so that\n often a man who is drunk becomes sober again, and in the same way a man who has\n just eaten to satiety is made hungry again by eating of it. \n \n There is another kind of loaf called tabyrites, of which Sopater, in his Cnidia,\n says\u2014The tabyrites loaf was one which fills the cheeks. \n There was also a loaf called the ach\u00e6inas. And this loaf is mentioned by Semus, in\n the eighth book of his Delias; and he says that is made by the women who celebrate\n the Thesmophoria. They are loaves of a large size. And the festival is called\n Megalartia, which is a name given to it by those who carry these loaves, who\n cry\u2014 Eat a large ach\u00e6inas, full of fat. \n \n There is another loaf called cribanites, or the pan-loaf. This is mentioned by\n Aristophanes, in his Old Age. And he introduces a woman selling bread, complaining\n that her loaves have been taken from her by those who have got rid of the effects\n of their old age\u2014 \n \n A. What was the matter? \n \n B. My hot loaves, my son. \n \n A. Sure you are mad? \n \n B. My nice pan-loaves, my son, \n So white, so hot. . . . . . \n \n There is another loaf called the encryphias, or secret loaf.\n And this is mentioned by Nicostratus, in his Hierophant, and Archestratus the\n inventor of made dishes, whose testimony I will introduce at the proper\n season. \n There is a loaf also called dipyrus, or twice-baked. Eubulus says, in his\n Ganymede\u2014 \n And nice hot twice-baked loaves. \n And Alc\u00e6us says, in his Ganymede\u2014 \n \n A. But what are dipyri, or twice-baked loaves? \n \n B. Of all loaves the most delicate. \n \n \n There is another loaf, called laganum. This is very light, and not very\n nutritious; and the loaf called apanthracis is even less nutritious still. And\n Aristophanes mentions the laganum in his Ecclesiazus\u00e6, saying\u2014 \n The lagana are being baked. \n And the apanthracis is mentioned by Diocles the Carystian, in the first\n book of his treatise on Wholesomes, saying\u2014 The apanthracis is more tender\n than the laganum: and it appears that it is made on the coals, like that called\n by the Attic writers encryphias, which the Alexandrians consecrate to Saturn,\n and put them in the temple of Saturn for every one to eat who pleases. \n \n ","74":"\n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, and in his Muses (and this play is an\n emendation of the former one), thus enumerates the different kinds of\n loaves\u2014 The panloaf, the homorus, the statites, the encris, the loaf made\n of meal, the half loaf, which Sophron also mentions in his Female\n Actors, saying\u2014 \n Pan-loaves and homori, a dainty meal \n For goddesses, and a half-loaf for Hecate. \n And I know, my friends, that the Athenians spell this word with a\n \u03c1 , writing \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd and \u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ; but\n Herodotus, in the second book of his history, writes it with a \u03bb , saying \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u1ff3\n \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6. And so Sophron said\u2014 \n Who dresses suet puddings or clibanites, \n Or half-loaves here? \n And the same writer also speaks of a loaf which he calls \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, saying in his Gyn\u00e6cea\u2014 \n He feasted me till night with placite loaves. \n Sophron also mentions tyron bread, or bread compounded with cheese,\n saying in the play called the Mother-in-law\u2014 \n \n I bid you now eat heartily, \n For some one has just giv'n a tyron loaf, \n Fragrant with cheese, to all the children. \n And Nicander of Colophon, in his Dialects, calls unleavened bread\n \u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. And Plato the comic writer, in his\n Long Night, calls large ill-made loaves Cilician, in these words\u2014 \n Then he went forth, and bought some loaves, no nice \n Clean rolls, but dirty huge Cilicians. \n And in the drama entitled Menelaus, he calls some loaves Agel\u00e6i, or common loaves. There is also a loaf mentioned by Alexis, in\n his Cyprian, which he calls autopyrus\u2014 \n Having just eaten autopyrus bread. \n And Phrynichus, in his Poastri\u00e6, speaks of the same loaves, calling them\n autopyrit\u00e6, saying\u2014 \n With autopyrite loaves, and sweeten'd cakes \n Of well-press'd figs and olives. \n \n \n And Sophocles makes mention of a loaf called orindes, in his Triptolemus, which\n has its name from being made of rice ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1 ), or\n from a grain raised in Aethiopia, which resembles sesamum. \n Aristophanes also, in his Tagenist\u00e6, or the Fryers, makes mention of rolls called\n collabi, and says\u2014 \n Each of you take a collabus. \n And in a subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n Bring here a paunch of pig in autumn born, \n With hot delicious collabi. \n And these rolls are made of new wheat, as Philyllius declares in his\n Auge\u2014 \n Here I come, bearing in my hands the offspring \n Of three months' wheat, hot doughy collabi, \n Mixed with the milk of the grass-feeding cow. \n \n \n There is also a kind of loaf called maconid\u00e6, mentioned by Aleman, in his\n fifteenth book, in these terms\u2014 Tere were seven coaches for the guests, and\n an equal number of tables of maconid\u00e6 loaves, crowned with a white tablecoth,\n and with sesamum, and in handsome dishes. Chrysocolla are a food made\n of honey and flax. \n \n \n There is also a kind of loaf called collyra, mentioned by Aristophanes in his\n Peace\u2014 \n A large collyra, and a mighty lump \n Of dainty meat upon it. \n And in his Holcades he says\u2014 \n And a collyra for the voyagers, \n Earn'd by the trophy raised at Marathon.' \n \n \n ","75":"\n There is a loaf also called the obelias, or the penny loaf, so called because it\n is sold for a penny, as in Alexandria; or else because it is baked on small spits.\n Aristophanes, in his Farmers, says\u2014 \n Then perhaps some one bakes a penny loaf. \n And Pherecrates, in his Forgetful Man, says\u2014 \n Olen, now roast a penny roll with ashes, \n But take care, don't prefer it to a loaf. \n And the men who in the festivals carried these penny rolls on their\n shoulders were called \u1f40\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. And Socrates,\n in his sixth book of his Surnames, says that it was Bacchus who invented the penny\n roll on his expeditions. There is a roll called etnites, the same which is also\n named lecithites, according to the statement of Eucrates. \n The Messapians call bread \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2, and they call\n satiety \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, and those things which give a\n surfeit they call \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 ; at least, those terms are\n used by Bl\u00e6sus, in his Mesotriba, and by Archilochus, in his Telephus, and by\n Rhinthon, in his Amphitryon. And the Romans call bread panis. \n \n Nastus is a name given to a large loaf of leavened bread, according to the\n statement of Polemarchus and Artemidorus. But the Heracleon is a kind of\n cheesecake. And Nicostratus says, in his Sofa\u2014 \n Such was the size, O master, of the nastus, \n A large white loaf. It was so deep, its top \n Rose like a tower quite above its basket. \n Its smell, when that the top was lifted up, \n Rose up, a fragrance not unmix'd with honey \n Most grateful to our nostrils, still being hot. \n \n \n The name of bread among the Ionians was cnestus, as Artemidorus the Ephesian\n states in his Memorials of Ionia. Thronus was the name of a particular kind of\n loaf, as it is stated by Neanthes of Cyzicus, in the second book of his Grecian\n History, where he writes as follows\u2014 But Codrus takes a\n slice of a loaf of the kind called thronus, and a piece of meat, such as they\n give to the old men.' \n \n There is, among the Elians, a kind of loaf baked on the ashes which they call\n bacchylus, as Nicander states in the second book of his treatise on Dialects. And\n Dihilus mentions it in his Woman who went Astray, in these words\u2014 \n To bring loaves baked on ashes, strain'd through sieves. \n \n \n The thing called \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 is also a kind of roll;\n and that also is baked on the ashes; and by some it is called \u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, or leavened. Cratinus, in his Effeminate\n People\u2014 \n First of all I an apopyrias have\u2014 \n \n \n ","76":"\n And Archestratus, in his Gastronomy, thus speaks of flour and of rolls\u2014 \n First, my dear Moschus, will I celebrate \n The bounteous gifts of Ceres the fair-hair'd. \n And cherish these my sayings in thy heart. \n Take these most excellent things,\u2014the well-made cake \n Of fruitful barley, in fair Lesbos grown, \n On the circumfluous hill of Eresus; \n Whiter than driven snow, if it be true \n That these are loaves such as the gods do eat, \n Which Mercury their steward buys for them. \n Good is the bread in seven-gated Thebes, \n In Thasos, and in many other cities, \n But all compared with these would seem but husks, \n And worthless refuse. Be you sure of this. \n Seek too the round Thessalian roll, the which \n A maid's fair hand has kneaded, which the natives \n Crimmatias call; though others chondrinus. \n Nor let the Tegean son of finest flour, \n The fine encryphias be all unpraised. \n Athens, Minerva's famous city, sends \n The best of loaves to market, food for men; \n There is, besides, Erythra, known for grapes, \n Nor less for a white loaf in shapely pan, \n Carefully moulded, white and beautiful, \n A tempting dish for hungry guests at supper. \n The epicure Archestratus says this; and he counsels us to have a\n Ph\u0153nician or Lydian slave for a baker; for he was not ignorant that the best\n makers of loaves come from Cappadocia. And he speaks thus\u2013 \n Take care, and keep a Lydian in thy house, \n Or an all-wise Phoenician; who shall know \n Your inmost thoughts, and each day shall devise \n New forms to please your mind, and do your bidding. \n \n \n \n ","77":"\n Antiphanes also speaks of the Athenian loaves as pre- eminently good, in his\n Omphale, saying\u2014 \n For how could any man of noble birth \n Ever come forth from this luxurious house, \n Seeing these fair-complexion'd wheaten loaves \n Filling the oven in such quick succession, \n And seeing them, devise fresh forms from moulds, \n The work of Attic hands; well-train'd by wise \n Thearion to honour holy festivals. \n This is that Thearion the celebrated baker, whom Plato makes mention of\n in the Gorgias, joining him and Mith\u00e6cus in the same catalogue, writing thus.\n Those who have been or are skilful providers for the body you enumerated\n with great anxiety; Thearion the baker, and Mith\u00e6cus who wrote the treatise\n called the Sicilian Cookery, and Sarambus the innkeeper, saying that they were\n admirable providers for the body, the one preparing most excellent loaves of\n bread, and the other preparing meat, and the other wine. And\n Aristophanes, in the Gerytades and Aeolosicon, speaks in this manner\u2014 \n I come now, having left the baker's shop, \n The seat of good Thearion's pans and ovens. \n And Eubulus makes mention of Cyprian loaves as exceedingly good, in his\n Orthane, using these words\u2014 \n 'Tis a hard thing, beholding Cyprian loaves, \n To ride by carelessly; for like a magnet \n They do attract the hungry passengers. \n And Ephippus, in his Diana, makes mention of the \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 loaves (and they are the same as the \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 ) in these terms\u2014 \n Eating the collix, baked in well-shaped pan, \n By Alexander's Thessalian recipe. \n Aristophanes also says, in his Acharnensians\u2014 \n All hail, my collix-eating young B\u0153otian. \n \n \n ","78":"\n When the conversation had gone on this way, one of the grammarians present, whose\n name was Arrian, said\u2014 This food is as old as the time of Saturn, my friends; for\n we are not rejoicing in meal, for the city is full of bread, nor in all this\n catalogue of loaves. But since I have fallen in with another treatise of\n Chrysippus of Tyana, which is entitled a treatise on the Art of Making Bread; and\n since I have had experience of the different recipes given in it at the houses of many of my friends, I will proceed to say something my-\n self also on the subject of loaves. The kind of loaf which is called \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, differs in some respect from that made in\n a pan, and from that made in an oven. But if you make it with hard leaven, it will\n be bright and nice, so tat it may be eaten dry; but if it be made with a looser\n leaven, then it will be light but not bright. But the loaf which s made in a pan,\n and that which is made in an oven, require a softer kind of leaven. And among the\n Greeks there is a kind of bread which is called tender, being made up with a\n little milk and oil, and a fair quantity of salt; and one must make the dough for\n this bread loose. And this kind of loaf is called the Cappadocian, since tender\n bread is made in the greatest quantities in Cappadocia. But the Syrians call\n loaves of this kind \u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03bc\u1f74 ; and it is the best\n bread made in Syria, because it can be eaten hot; and it is like a flower. But\n there is also a loaf called boletinus, from being made like a mushroom, and the\n kneading-trough is smeared with poppies plastered over the bottom of it, on which\n the dough is placed, and by this expedient it is prevented from sticking to the\n trough while the leaven is mixed in. But when it is put in the oven, then some\n groats are spread under on a tile, and then the bread is put on it, and it gets a\n most beautiful colour, like cheese which has been smoked. \n There is also a kind of bread called strepticias, which is made up with a little\n milk, and pepper and a little oil is added, and sometimes suet is substituted. And\n a little wine, and pepper, and milk, and a little oil, or sometimes suet, is\n employed in making the cake called artolaganum. But for making the cakes called\n capuridia tracta, you mix the same ingredients that you do for bread, and the\n difference is in the baking. \n ","79":"\n So when the mighty sophist of Rome had enunciated these precepts of Aristarchus,\n Cynulcus said\u2014O Ceres, what a wise man! It is not without reason that the\n admirable Blepsias has pupils as the sand of the sea in number, and has amassed\n wealth from this excellent wisdom of his, beyond all that was acquired by Gorgias\n or Protagoras. So that I am afraid, by the goddesses, to say whether he himself is\n blind, or whether those who have entrusted his pupils to him have all but one eye,\n so as scarcely to be able to see, nume- rous as they are.\n Happy are they, or rather blessed ought I to call them, whose masters treat them\n to such divine lectures. And in reply to this Magnus, a man fond of the table, and\n very much inclined to praise this grammarian to excess, because of the abundance\n of his learning, said\u2014But ye\u2014 \n Men with unwashen feet, who lie on the ground, \n You roofless wanderers, all-devouring throats, \n Feasting on other men's possessions, \n as Eubulus says\u2014did not your father Diogenes, once when he was eagerly\n eating a cheesecake at a banquet, say to some one who put the question to him,\n that he was eating bread excellently well made? But as for you, you \n Stranglers of dishes of white paunches, \n as the same poet, Eubulus, says, you keep on speaking without ever giving\n place to others; and you are never quiet until some one throws you a crust or a\n bone, as he would do to a dog. How do you come to know that cubi (I do not mean\n those which you are continually handling) are a kind of loaf, square, seasoned\n with anise, and cheese, and oil, as Heraclides says in his Cookery Book? But\n Blepsias overlooked this kind, as also he did the thargelus, which some call the\n thalysius. But Crates, in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect,\n says that the thargelus is the first loaf made after the carrying home of the\n harvest. The loaf made of sesame he had never seen, nor that which is called\n anastatus, which is made for the Arrephori. There is also a loaf called the pyramus, made of sesame, and perhaps being\n the same as the sesamites. But Trypho mentions all these different kinds in the\n first book of his treatise on Plants, as he also does those which are called\n thiagones. And these last are loaves made for the gods in Aetolia. There are also\n loaves called dramices and araxis among the Athamanes. \n ","80":"\n And the writers of books on dialects give lists of the names of different loaves.\n Seleucus speaks of one called dramis, which bears this name among the Macedonians;\n and of another called daratus by the Thessalians. And he speaks of the etnites,\n saying that it is the same as the lecithites, that is to say,\n made of the yolks of eggs and of pulse. And he says that the loaf called \u1f10\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, has its name from being made of wheat crushed\n ( \u1f10\u03c1\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ), and not sifted, and of groats.\n And Amerias speaks of a loaf called xeropyrites, made of pure wheat, and nothing\n else; and so does Tima- chidas. But Nicander says that thiagones is the name given\n by the Aetolians to those loaves which are made for the gods. The Egyptians have a\n bread which is rather bitter, which they call cyllastis. And Aristophanes speaks\n of it in his Danaides, saying\u2014 \n Mention the cyllastis and the petosiris. \n Hecat\u00e6us, too, and Herodotus mention it; and so does Phanodemus, in the\n seventh book of his Attic History. But Nicander of Thyatira says, that it is bread\n made of barley which is called cyllastis by the Egyptians. Alexis calls dirty\n loaves ph\u00e6i, in his Cyprian, saying\u2014 \n \n A. Then you are come at last? \n \n B. Scarce could I find \n Of well-baked loaves enough\u2014 \n \n A. A plague upon you; \n But what now have you got? \n \n B. I bring with me \n Sixteen, a goodly number; eight of them \n Tempting and white, and just as many ph\u00e6i. \n \n \n And Seleucus says that there is a very closely made hot bread which is called\n blema. And Philemon, in the first book of his Oracles, Useful Things of\n Every Kind, says\u2014that bread made of unsifted wheat, and containing the\n bran and everything, is called \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2. He says,\n too, that there are loaves which are called blomilii, which have divisions in\n them, which the Romans call quadrati. And that bread made of bran is called\n brattime, which Amerias. and Timachidas call euconon or teuconon. But Philetas, in\n his Miscellanies, says that there is a kind of loaf which is called spoleus, which\n is only eaten by relations when assembled together. \n ","81":"\n Now you may find barley-cakes mentioned in his writings by Tryphon, and by many\n other authors. Among the Athenians it is called phystes, not being too closely\n kneaded. There is also the cardamale, and the berx, and the tolype, and the\n Achilleum; and perhaps that is a cake which is made of the Achillean barley. Then\n there is the thridakina, so named from lettuce, the \u0153nutta,\n so called from wine; the melitutta, from honey; and the crinon, the name of which\n is derived from the lily, which last is also the name of a choral dance, mentioned\n by Apollophanes, in the Dalis. But the cakes called thridacisc\u00e6 by Alcman, are the\n same as the Attic thridacin\u00e6. But Alcman speaks thus\u2014 \n The thridacisca, and the cribanotus. \n And Sosibius, in the third book of his essay on Alcman, says, that\n cribana is a name given to a peculiar kind of cheesecake, in shape like a breast.\n But the barley cake, which is given in sacrifices to be tasted by the sacrificers,\n is called hygea. And there is also one kind of barley cake which is called by\n Hesiod amolgs\u00e6a. \n The amolg\u00e6an cake of barley made, \n And milk of goats whose stream is nearly dry. \n And he calls it the cake of the shepherds, and very strengthening. For\n the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 means that which is in the\n greatest vigour. But I may fairly beg to be excused from giving a regular list\n (for I have not a very unimpeachable memory) of all the kinds of biscuits and\n cakes which Aristomenes the Athenian speaks of in the third book of his treatise\n on Things pertaining to the Sacred Ceremonies. And we ourselves were acquainted\n with that man, though we were young, and he was older than we. And he was an actor\n in the Old Comedy, a freedman of that most accomplished king Adrian, and called by\n him the Attic partridge. \n And Ulpian said\u2014By whom is the word freedman ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ) ever used? And when some one replied that there was a\n play with that title\u2014namely, the Freedman of Phrynichus, and that Menander, in his\n Beaten Slave, had the word freedwoman ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 ), and was proceeding to mention other instances; he asked\n again\u2014What is the difference between \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \n and\n \u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. However, it was agreed upon to\n postpone this part of the discussion for the present. \n ","82":"\n And Galen, when we were just about to lay hands on the loaves, said\u2014We will not\n begin supper until you have heard what the sons of the Asclepiad\u00e6 have said about\n loaves, and cheesecakes, and meal, and flour. Diphilus the Siphnian, in his treatise on What is Wholesome to be eaten by People in\n Health and by Invalids, says, Loaves made of wheat are by far more\n nutritious and by far more digestible than those made of barley, and are in\n every respect superior to them; and the next best are those which are made of\n similago; and next to those come the loaves made of sifted flour, and next to\n them those called syncomisti, Which are made of unsifted meal;\u2014for these appear\n to be more nutritious. But Philistion the Locrian says that the\n loaves made of similago are superior to those made of groats, as far as their\n strengthening properties go; and next to them he ranks loaves made of groats,\n then those made of sifted flour. But the rolls made of bran give a much less\n wholesome juice, and are by far less nutritious. And all bread is more\n digestible when eaten hot than cold, and it is also more digestible then, and\n affords a pleasanter and more wholesome juice; nevertheless, hot bread is apt\n to cause flatulence, though it is not the less digestible for that; while cold\n bread is filling and indigestible. But bread which is very stale and cold is\n less nutritious, and is apt to cause constipation of the bowels, and affords a\n very unpleasant juice. The bread called encryphiasis is heavy and difficult of\n digestion, because it is not baked in an equal manner; but that which is called\n ipnites and caminites is indigestible and apt to disagree with people. That\n called escharites, and that which is fried, is more easily secreted because of\n the admixture of oil in it, but is not so good for the stomach, on account of\n the smell which there is about it. But the bread called 'the clibanites' has\n every possible good quality; for it gives a pleasant and wholesome juice, and\n is good for the stomach, and is digestible, and agrees exceedingly well with\n every one, for it never clogs the bowels, and never relaxes them too\n much. \n \n But Andreas the physician says that there are loaves in Sicily made of the\n sycamine, and that those who eat them lose their hair and become bald. Mnesitheus\n says that wheat-bread is more digestible than barley-bread, and that those\n which are made with the straw in them are exceedingly nutritious; for they are\n the most easily digested of all food. But bread which is made of rye, if it be\n eaten in any quantity, is heavy and difficult of digestion; on which account\n those who eat it do not keep their health, But you should know that\n corn which has not been exposed to the fire, and which has\n not been ground, causes flatulence, and heaviness, and vertigo, and headache. \n ","83":"\n After all this conversation it seemed good to go to supper. And when the Uraeum\n was carried round, Leonidas said, Euthydemus the Athenian, my friends, in\n his treatise on Pickles, says that Hesiod has said with respect to every kind\n of pickle\u2014 * * * * * * * \n \n Some sorrily-clad fishermen did seek \n To catch a lamprey; men who love to haunt \n The Bosporus's narrow strait, well stored \n With fish for pickling fit. They cut their prey \n In large square portions, and then plunge them deep \n Into the briny tub: nor is the oxyrhyncus \n A kind to be despised by mortal man; \n Which the bold sons of ocean bring to market \n Whole and in pieces. Of the noble tunny \n The fair Byzantium the mother is, \n And of the scombrus lurking in the deep, \n And of the well-fed ray. The snow-white Paros \n Nurses the colius for human food; \n And citizens from Bruttium or Campania, \n Fleeing along the broad Ionian sea, \n Will bring the orcys, which shall potted be, \n And placed in layers in the briny cask, \n Till honour'd as the banquet's earliest course. \n Now these verses appear to me to be the work of some cook rather than\n of that most accomplished Hesiod; for how is it possible for him to have spoken\n of Parium or Byzantium, and still more of Tarentum and the Bruttii and the\n Campanians, when he was many years more ancient than any of these places or\n tribes? So it seems to me that they are the verses of Euthydemus\n himself. \n \n And Dionysiocles said, \"Whoever wrote the verses, my good Leonidas, is a matter\n which you all, as being grammarians of the highest reputation, are very capable of\n deciding. But since the discussion is turning upon pickles and salt fish,\n concerning which I recollect a proverb which was thought deserving of being quoted\n by Charchus the Solensian,\u2014 \n For old salt-fish is fond of marjoram. \n \n I too myself will say a word on the subject, which is not\n unconnected with my own art. \n ","84":"\n Diodes the Carystian, in his treatise on the Wholesomes, as it is entitled, says,\n Of all salt-fish which are destitute of fat, the best is the hor\u00e6um; and\n of all that are fat, the best is the tunny-fish. But Icesius says,\n that neither the pelamydes nor the hor\u00e6a are easily secreted by the\n stomach; and that the younger tunnies are similar in most respects to the\n cybii, but that they have a great superiority over those which are called\n hor\u00e6a. And he says the same of the Byzantine hor\u00e6a, in comparison with\n those which are caught in other places. And he says that not only the\n tunnies, but that all other fish caught at Byzantium is superior to that which\n is caught elsewhere. \n \n To this Daphnus the Ephesian added,\u2014Archestratus, who sailed round the whole world\n for the sake of finding out what was good to eat, and what pleasures he could\n derive from the use of his inferior members, says\u2014 \n And a large slice of fat Sicilian tunny, \n Carefully carved, should be immersed in brine. \n But the saperdes is a worthless brute, \n A delicacy fit for Ponticans \n And those who like it. For few men can tell \n How bad and void of strengthening qualities \n Those viands are. The scombrus should be kept \n Three days before you sprinkle it with salt, \n Then let it lie half-pickled in the cask. \n But when you come unto the sacred coast, \n Where proud Byzantium commands the strait, \n Then take a slice of delicate horeum, \n For it is good and tender in those seas. \n But that epicure Archestratus has omitted to enumerate the pickle-juice\n called elephantine, which is spoken of by Crates the comic poet, in his Samians;\n who says of it\u2014 \n A sea-born turtle in the bitter waves \n Bears in its skin the elephantine pickle; \n And crabs swift as the wind, and thin-wing'd pike, \n \n * * * * * \n But that the elephantine pickle of Crates was very celebrated\n Aristophanes bears witness, in his Thesmophoriazus\u00e6, in these words\u2014 \n \n Sure comic poetry is a mighty food; \n Listen to Crates, he will tell you, how \n The elephantine pickle, easily made, \n Is dainty seas'ning; many other jokes \n Of the same kind he utter'd. \n \n \n ","85":"\n And there was another kind, which Alexis calls raw pickle, in his Apeglaucomenos.\n And the same poet, in his Wicked Woman, introduces a cook talking about the\n preparation of salt-fish and pickled fish, in the following verses:\u2014 \n I wish now, sitting quiet by myself, \n To ponder in my mind some dainty dishes; \n And also to arrange what may be best \n For the first course, and how I best may flavour \n Each separate dish, and make it eatable. \n Now first of all the pickled hor\u00e6um comes; \n This will but cost one penny; wash it well, \n Then strew a large flat dish with seasoning, \n And put in that the fish. Pour in white wine \n And oil, then add some boil'd beef marrow-bones, \n And take it from the fire, when the last zest \n Shall be by assaf\u0153tida imparted. \n And, in his Apeglaucomenos, a man being asked for his contribution to the\n feast, says\u2014 \n \n A. Indeed you shall not half a farthing draw \n From me, unless you name each separate dish. \n \n B. That reasonable is. \n \n A. Well, bring a slate \n And pencil; now your items. \n \n B. First, there is \n Raw pickled fish, and that will fivepence cost. \n \n A. What next \n \n B. Some mussels, sevenpence for them. \n \n A. Well, there's no harm in that. What follows\n next \n \n B. A pennyworth of urchins of the sea. \n \n A. Still I can find no fault. \n \n B. The next in order \n Is a fine dish of cabbage, which you said . . . \n \n A. Well, that will do. \n \n B. For that I paid just twopence. \n \n A. What was't I said. . . \n \n B. A cybium for threepence. \n \n A. But are you sure you've nought embezzled\n here? \n B. My friend, you've no experience of the market; \n You know not how the grubs devour the greens. \n \n A. But how is that a reason for your charging \n A double price for salt-fish? \n \n B. The greengrocer} \n Is also a salt-fishmonger; go and ask him. \n \n A conger, tenpence. \n \n A. That is not too much. \n What next? \n \n B. I bought a roast fish for a drachma. \n \n A. Bah! how he runs on now towards the end, \n As if a fever had o'ertaken him. \n \n B. Then add the wine, of which I bought three\n gallons \n When you were drunk, ten obols for each gallon. \n \n \n ","86":"\n And Icesius says, in the second book of hi treatise on the Materials of\n Nourishment, that pelamydes are a large kind of cybium. And Posidippus speaks of\n the cybium, in his Transformed. But Euthydemus, in his treatise on Salt Fish, says\n that the fish called the Delcanus is so named from the river Delcon, where it is\n taken; and then, when pickled and salted, it is very good indeed for the stomach.\n But Dorion, in his book on Fishes, calls the leptinus the lebianus, and says,\n \"that some people say that is the same fish as the delcanus; and that the\n ceracinus is called by man people the saperdes; and that the best are those which\n come from the Palus M\u00e6otis. And he says that the mullet which are caught about\n Abdera are excellent; and next to them, those which are caught near Sinope; and\n that they, when pickled and salted, are very good for the stomach. But those, he\n says, which are called mulli are by some people called agnotidia, and by some\n platistaci, though they are all the same fish; as also is the chellares. For that\n he, being but one fish, has received a great variety of names; for that he is\n called a bacchus, and an oniscus, and a chellares. And those of the larger size\n are called platistaci, and those of riddle size mulli, and those which are but\n small are called agnotidia. But Aristophanes also mentions the mulli, in his\n Holcades\u2014 \n Scombri, and coli\u00e6, and lebii, \n And mulli, and saperd\u00e6, and all tunnies. \n \n \n ","87":"\n When Dionysiocles was silent upon this, Varus the grammarian said,\u2014But Antiphanes\n the poet, also, in his Deucalion, mentions these kinds of pickled salt-fish, where\n he says\u2014 \n If any one should wish for caviar \n From mighty sturgeon, fresh from Cadiz' sea; \n Or else delights in the Byzantine tunny, \n And courts its fragrance. \n And in his Parasite he says\u2014 \n \n Caviar from the sturgeon in the middle, \n Fat, white as snow, and hot. \n And Nicostratus or Philet\u00e6rus, in his Antyllus, says\u2014 \n Let the Byzantine salt-fish triumph here, \n And paunch from Cadiz, carefully preserved. \n And a little further on, he proceeds\u2014 \n But, O ye earth and gods! I found a man, \n An honest fishmonger of pickled fish, \n Of whom I bought a huge fish ready scaled, \n Cheap at a drachma, for two oboli. \n Three days' hard eating scarcely would suffice \n That we might finish it; no, nor a fortnight, \n So far does it exceed the common size. \n After this Ulpian, looking upon Plutarch, chimed in,\u2014It seems to me that\n no one, in all that has been said, has included the Mendesian fish, which are so\n much fancied by you gentlemen of Alexandria; though I should have thought that a\n mad dog would scarcely touch them; nor has any one mentioned the hemineri or\n half-fresh fish, which you think so good, nor the pickled shads. And Plutarch\n replied,\u2014 The heminerus, as far as I know, does not differ from the half-pickled\n fish which have been already mentioned, and which your elegant Archestratus speaks\n of; but, however, Sopater the Paphian has mentioned the heminerus, in his Slave of\n Mystacus, saying\u2014 \n He then received the caviar from a sturgeon \n Bred in the mighty Danube, dish much prized, \n Half-fresh, half-pickled, by the wandering Scythians. \n And the same man includes the Mendesian in his list\u2014 \n A slightly salt Mendesian in season, \n And mullet roasted on the glowing embers. \n And all those who have tried, know that these dishes are by far more\n delicate and agreeable than the vegetables and figs which you make such a fuss\n about. Tell us now also, whether the word \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \n is used in the masculine gender by the Attic writers; for we know it is by\n Epicharmus. \n ","88":"\n And while Ulpian was thinking this over with himself, Myrtilus, anticipating him,\n said,\u2014Cratinus, in his Dionysalexander, has\u2014 I will my basket fill with Pontic\n pickles, (where he uses \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 as masculine;) and\n Plato, in his Jupiter Illtreated, says\u2014 \n \n All that I have amounts to this, \n And I shall lose my pickled fish ( \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ). \n And Aristophanes says, in his Daitaleis\u2014 \n I'm not ashamed to wash this fine salt-fish ( \u03c4\u1f7a\u03bd\n \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u1f76 ), \n From all the evils which I know he has. \n And Crates says, in his Beasts\u2014 \n And you must boil some greens, and roast some fish \n And pickled fish likewise, ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, )\n and keep your hands \n From doing any injury to us. \n But the noun is formed in a very singular manner by Hermippus, in his\n Female Bread-Sellers\u2014 \n And fat pickled fish ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1 ). \n And Sophocles says, in his Phineus\u2014 \n A pickled corpse ( \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) Egyptian\n to behold. \n Aristophanes has also treated us to a diminutive form of the word, in his\n Peace\u2014 \n Bring us some good \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd to the\n fields \n And Cephisodorus says, in his Pig\u2014 \n Some middling meat, or some \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n And Pherecrates, in his Deserters, has\u2014 \n The woman boil'd some pulse porridge, and lentils, \n And so awaited each of us, and roasted \n Besides an orphan small \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n Epicharmus also uses the word in the masculine gender, \u1f41 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. And Herodotus does the same in his ninth\n book; where he says\u2014 The salt-fish ( \u03bf\u1f31\n \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 ) lying on the fire, leaped about and quivered. And\n the proverbs, too, in which the word occurs, have it in the masculine gender:\u2014\n \n Salt-fish ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) is done if it but see\n the fire. \n Salt-fish ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) when too long kept loves\n marjoram. \n Salt-fish ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ) does never get its due\n from men. \n But the Attic writers often use it as a neuter word; and the genitive\n case, as they use it, is \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. Chionids\n says, in his Beggars\u2014 \n Will you then eat some pickled fish ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ), ye ods! \n And the dative is \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9, like \u03be\u03af\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9 \u2014 \n Beat therefore now upon this pickled fish ( \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\n \u03c4\u1ff7\u03b4\u03b5 ). \n And Menander uses it \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, in the\n accusative case, in his Man selecting an Arbitrator\u2014 \n I spread some salt upon the pickled fish ( \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78\n \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n \n But when the word is masculine the genitive case does not end\n with \u03c2. \n \n ","89":"\n The Athenians were so fond of pickled fish that they enrolled as citizens the sons\n of Ch\u00e6rephilus the seller of salt-fish; as Alexis tells us, in his Epidaurus, when\n he says\u2014 \n For 'twas salt-fish that made Athenians \n And citizens of Ch\u00e6rephilus's sons. \n And when Timocles once saw them on horseback, he said that two tunny-fish\n were among the Satyrs. And Hyperides the orator mentions them too. And Antiphanes\n speaks of Euthynus the seller of pickled fish, in his Couris, in these terms:\u2014\n \n And going to the salt-fish seller, him \n I mean with whom I used to deal, there wait for me; \n And if Euthynus be not come, still wait, \n And occupy the man with fair excuses, \n And hinder him from cutting up the fish. \n And Alexis, in his Hippiscus, and again in his Soraci, makes mention of\n Phidippus; and he too was a dealer in salt-fish\u2014 \n There was another man, Phidippus hight, \n A foreigner who brought salt-fish to Athens. \n \n \n ","90":"\n And while we were eating the salt-fish and getting very anxious to drink, Daphnus\n said, holding up both his hands,\u2014 Heraclides of Tarentum, my friends, in his\n treatise entitled The Banquet, says, \"It is good to take a moderate quantity of\n food before drinking, and especially to eat such dishes as one is accustomed to;\n for from the eating of things which have not been eaten for a long time the wine\n is apt to be turned sour, so as not to sit on the stomach, and many twinges and\n spasms are often originated. But some people think that these also are bad for the\n stomach; I mean, all kinds of vegetables and salted fish, since they possess\n qualities apt to cause pangs; but that glutinous and invigorating food is the most\n wholesome,\u2014being ignorant that a great many of the things which assist the\n secretions are, on the contrary, very good for the stomach; among which is the\n plant called sisarum, (which Epicharmus speaks of, in his Agrostinus, and also in\n his Earth and Sea; and so does Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on the\n Wholesomes;) and asparagus and white beet, (for the black beet is apt to check the\n secretions,) and cockles, and solens, and sea mussels, and chem\u00e6, and periwinkles,\n and perfect pickles, and salt-fish, which are void of smell,\n and many kinds of juicy fishes. And it is good that, before the main dinner, there\n should be served up what is called salad, and beet-root, and salt-fish, in order\n that by having the edge of our appetite taken off we may go with less eagerness to\n what is not equally nutritious. But at the beginning of dinner it is best to avoid\n abundant draughts; for they are bad as generating too great a secretion of humous\n in the body. \n \n But the Macedonians, according to the statement of Ephippus the Olynthian,\n in his treatise Concerning the Burial of Alexander and Heph\u00e6stion, had no\n notion of moderation in drinking, but started off at once with enormous\n draughts before eating, so as to be drunk before the first course was off the\n table, and to be unable to enjoy the rest of the banquet. \n \n ","91":"\n But Diphilus the Siphnian says, The salt pickles which are made of fish,\n whether caught in the sea, or in the lake, or in the river, are not very\n nourishing, nor very juicy; but are inflammatory, and act strongly on the\n bowels, and are provocative of desire. But the best of them are those Which are\n made of animals devoid of fat, such as cybia, and hor\u00e6a, and other kinds like\n them. And of fat fish, the best are the different kinds of tunny, and the young\n of the tunny; for the old ones are larger and harsher to the taste; and above\n all, the Byzantine tunnies are so. But the tunny, says he, is the same as the\n larger pelamys, the small kind of which is the same as the cybium, to which\n species the hor\u00e6um also belongs. But the sarda is of very nearly the same size\n as the colias. And the scombrus is a light fish, and one which the stomach\n easily gets rid of; but the colias is a glutinous fish, very like a squill, and\n apt to give twinges, and has an inferior juice, but nevertheless is nutritious.\n And the best are those which are called the Amycl\u00e6an, and the Spanish, which is\n also called the Saxitan; for they are lighter and sweeter. \n \n But Strabo, in the third book of his work on Geography, says that near the Islands\n of Hercules, \n and off the city of Carthagena, is a city named Sexitania, from which the\n salt-fish above-mentioned derive their name; and there is another city called\n Scombroaria, so called from the scombri which are caught in its neighbourhood, and\n of them the best sauce is made. But there are also fish which are called\n melandry\u00e6, which are mentioned by Epicharmus also, in his\n Ulysses the Deserter, in this way\u2014 \n Then there was salt and pickled fish to eat, \n Something not quite unlike melandry\u00e6. \n But the melandrys is the largest description of tunny, as Pamphilus\n explains in his treatise on Names; and that when preserved is very rich and\n oily. \n ","92":"\n \n But the raw pickle called omotarichum, says Diphilus, is\n called by some people cetema. It is a heavy sticky food, and moreover very\n indigestible. But the river coracinus, which some people call the peltes, the\n one from the Nile, I mean, which the people at Alexandria have a peculiar name\n for, and call the heminerus, is rather fat, and has a juice which is far from\n disagreeable; it is fleshy, nutritious, easily digestible, not apt to disagree\n with one, and in every respect superior to the mullet. Now the roe of every\n fish, whether fresh or dried and salted, is indigestible and apt to disagree.\n And the most so of all is the roe of the more oily and larger fish; for that\n remains harder for a long time, and is not decomposed. But it is not\n disagreeable to the taste when seasoned with salt and roasted. Every one,\n however, ought to soak dried and salted fish until the water becomes free from\n smell, and sweet. But dried sea-fish when boiled becomes sweeter; and they are\n sweeter too when eaten hot than cold. And Mnesitheus the Athenian, in\n his treatise on Comestibles, says, Those juices which are salt, and those\n which are sweet, all have an effect in relaxing the bowels; but those which are\n sharp and harsh are strongly diuretic. Those too which are bitter are generally\n diuretic, but some of them also relax the bowels. Those which are sour,\n however, check the secretions. \n \n And Xenophon, that most accomplished of writers, in his treatise entitled Hiero,\n or the Tyrant, abuses all such food, and says, For what, said Hiero, have\n you never noticed all the multitudinous contrivances which are set before\n tyrants, acid, and harsh, and sour; and whatever else there can be of the same\n kind?\u2014To be sure I have, said Simonides, and all those things appeared to me to\n be very contrary to the natural taste of any man. And do you think, said Hiero,\n that these dishes are anything else but the fancies of a diseased and vitiated\n taste; since those who eat with appetite, you well know,\n have no need of these contrivances and provo- catives. \n \n ","93":"\n After this had been said, Cynulcus asked for some spiced and boiled water to\n drink; saying that he rust wash down all those salt arguments with sweet drink.\n And Ulpian said to him with some indignation, and slapping his pillow with his\n hand,\u2014How long will it be before you leave off your barbarian tricks? Will you\n never stop till I am force to leave the party and go away, being unable to digest\n all your absurd speeches? And he replied,\u2014Now that I am at Rome, the Sovereign\n City, I use the language of the natives habitually; for among the ancient poets,\n and among those prose writers who pique themselves on the purity of their Greek,\n you may find some Persian nouns, because of their having got into a habit of using\n them in conversation. As for instance, one finds mention made of parasangs, and\n astand\u00e6, and angari (couriers), and a sch\u0153nus or perch, which last word is used\n either as a masculine or feminine noun, and it is a measure on the road, which\n retains even to this day that Persian name with many people. I know, too, that\n many of the Attic writers affect to imitate Macedonian expressions, on account of\n the great intercourse that there was between Attica and Macedonia. But it would be\n better, in my opinion, \n To drink the blood of hulls, and so prefer \n The death of great Themistocles, \n than to fall into your power. For I could not say, to drink the water of\n bulls; as to which you do not know what it is. Nor do you know that even among the\n very best poets and prose writers there are some things said which are not quite\n allowable. Accordingly Cephisodorus, the pupil of Isocrates the orator, in the\n third of his treatises addressed to Aristotle, says that a man might find several\n things expressed incorrectly by the other poets and sophists; as for instance, the\n expression used by Archilochus, That every man was immodest; and that apophthegm\n of Theodorus, That a man ought to get all he can, but to praise equality and\n moderation; and also, the celebrated line of Euripides about the tongue having\n spoken; and even by Sophocles, the lines which occur in the Aethiopians\u2014 \n \n These things I say to you to give you pleasure, \n Not wishing to do aught by violence: \n And do thou, like wise men, just actions praise, \n And keep thy hands and heart from unjust gain. \n And in another place the same poet says\u2014 \n I think no words, if companied by gain, \n Pernicious or unworthy. \n And in Homer, we find Juno represented as plotting against Jupiter, and\n Mars committing adultery. And for these sentiments and speeches those writers are\n universally blamed. \n ","94":"\n If therefore I have committed any errors, O you hunter of fine names and words, do\n not be too angry with me; for, according to Timotheus of Miletus, the poet,\u2014\n \n I do not sing of ancient themes, \n For all that's new far better seems. \n Jove's the new king of all the world; \n While anciently 'twas Saturn hurl'd \n His thunders, and the Heavens ruled; \n So I'll no longer be befool'd \n With dotard's ancient songs. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Alcestis\u2014 \n Dost thou love things of modern fashion? \n So too does he; for he is well assured \n That new devices, though they be too bold, \n Are better far than old contrivances. \n And I will prove to you, that the ancients were acquainted with the water\n which is called dicoctas, in order that you may not be indignant again, when I\n speak of boiled and spiced water. For, according to the Pseudheracles of\n Pherecrates\u2014 \n Suppose a man who thinks himself a genius \n Should something say, and I should contradict him, \n Still trouble not yourself; but if you please, \n Listen and give your best attention. \n But do not grudge, I entreat you, said Ulpian, to explain to me what is\n the nature of that Bull's water which you spoke of; for I have a great thirst for\n such words. And Cynulcus said,\u2014But I pledge you, according to your fancy; you\n thirst for words, taking a desire from Alexis, out of his Female Pythagorean,\n \n A cup of water boil'd; for when fresh-drawn \n 'Tis heavy, and indigestible to drink. \n But it was Sophocles, my friend, who spoke of Bull's water, in his\n Aegeus, from the river Taurus near Tr\u0153zen, in the neighbourhood of which there is\n a fountain called Hyo\u00ebssa. \n \n ","95":"\n But the ancients did also at times use very cold water in their draughts before\n dinner. But I will not tell you, unless you first teach me, whether the ancients\n were in the habit of drinking warm water at their banquets. For if their cups got\n their name from what took place in reference to\n them, and if they were set before the guests full of mixed liquors, then they\n certainly did not contain warm drink, ad were not put on the fire like kettles.\n For that they were in the habit of drinking warm water Eupolis proves, in his\n Demi\u2014 \n Warm for us now the brazen ewer quick, \n And bid the slaves prepare the victims new, \n That we may feast upon the entrails. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Omphale\u2014 \n May I ne'er see a man \n 'Boiling me water in a bubbling pail; \n For I have no disease, and wish for none. \n But if I feel a pain within my stomach, \n Or round about my navel, why I have \n A ring I lately gave a drachma for \n To a most skilful doctor. \n And, in his Anointing Woman, (but this play is attributed to Alexis\n also,) he says\u2014 \n But if you make our shop notorious, \n I swear by Ceres, best of goddesses, \n That I will empt the biggest ladle o'er you, \n Filling it with hot water from the kettle; \n And if I fail, may I ne'er drink free water more. \n And Plato, in the fourth book of his Polity, says\u2014 Desire in the\n mind must be much the same as thirst is in the body. Now, a man feels thirst\n for hot water or for cold; or for much water or for a little; or perhaps, in a\n word, for some particular drink. And if there be any heat combined with the\n thirst, then that will give a desire for cold water; but if a sensation of cold\n be united with it, that will engender a wish for warm water. And if by reason\n of the violence of the cause the thirst be great, that will give a desire for\n an abundant draught; but if the thirst be small, then the man will wish for but\n a small draught. But the thirst itself is not a desire of anything except of\n the thing itself, namely, drinking. And hunger, again, is not a desire of\n anything else except food. \n \n And Semus the Delian, in the second book of is Nesias. or treatise on Islands,\n says that in the island of Cimolus, cold places are prepared\n by being dug out against the summer, where people may put down vessels full of\n warm water, and then draw them up again in no respect different from snow. But\n warm water is called by the Athenians metaceras, a word used by Sophilus, in his\n Androcles. And Alexis says, in his Locrians\u2014 \n But the maid-servants pour'd forth water, \n One pouring boiling water, and the other warm. \n And Philemon, in his Corinthian Women, uses the same word. And Amphis\n says, in his Bath\u2014 \n One called out to the slaves to bring hot water, \n Another shouted for metaceras. \n \n \n ","96":"\n And as the Cynic was proceeding to heap other proofs on these, Pontianus said,\u2014The\n ancients, my friends, were in the habit also of drinking very cold water. At all\n events Alexis says, in his Parasite\u2014 \n I wish to make you taste this icy water, \n For I am proud of my well, whose limpid spring \n Is colder than the Ararus. \n And Hermippus, in his Cercopes, calls water drawn from wells \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1. Moreover, that men used to drink melted\n snow too, is shown by Alexis, in his Woman eating Mandragora\u2014 \n Sure is not man a most superfluous plant, \n Constantly using wondrous contradictions. \n Strangers we love, and our own kin neglect; \n Though having nothing, still we give to strangers. \n We bear our share in picnics, though we grudge it, \n And show our grudging by our sordidness. \n And as to what concerns our daily food, \n We wish our barley-cakes should white appear, \n And yet we make for them a dark black sauce, \n And stain pure colour with a deeper dye. \n Then we prepare to drink down melted snow; \n Yet if our fish be cold, we storm and rave. \n Sour or acid wine we scorn and loathe, \n Yet are delighted with sharp caper sauce. \n And so, as many wiser men have said, \n Not to be born at all is best for man; \n The next best thing, to die as soon as possible. \n And Dexicrates, in the play entitled The Men deceived by Themselves,\n says\u2014 \n But when I'm drunk I take a draught of snow, \n And Egypt gives me ointment for my head. \n \n And Euthycles, in his Prodigal Men, or The Letter, says\u2014\n \n He first perceived that snow was worth a price; \n He ought to be the first to eat the honeycombs. \n And that excellent writer Xenophon, in his Memorablia, shows that he was\n acquainted with the fashion of drinking snow. But Chares of Mitylene, in his\n History of Alexander, has told us how we are to proceed in order to keep snow when\n he is relating the siege of the Indian city Petra. For he says that Alexander dug\n thirty large trenches close to one anther, and filled them with snow, and then he\n heaped on the snow branches of oak; for that in that way snow would last a long\n time. \n ","97":"\n And that they used to cool wine, for the sake of drinking it in a colder state, is\n asserted by Strattis, in his Psychast\u00e6, or Cold Hunters\u2014 \n For no one ever would endure warm wine, \n But on the contrary, we use our wells \n To cool it in, and then we mix with snow. \n And Lysippus says, in his Bacch\u00e6\u2014 \n \n A. Hermon, what is the matter? Where are we? \n \n B. Nothing 's the matter, only that your father \n Has just dropt down into the well to cool himself, \n As men cool wine in summer. \n And Diphilus says, in his Little Monument\u2014 \n Cool the wine quick, O Doris. \n \n \n And Protagoras in the second book of his Comic Histories, relating the voyage of\n king Antiochus down the river, says something about the contrivances for procuring\n cold water, in these terms:\u2014 For during the day they expose it to the sun,\n and then at night they skim off the thickest part which rises to the surface,\n and expose the rest to the air, in large earthen ewers, on the highest parts of\n the house, and two slaves are kept sprinkling the vessels with water the whole\n night. And at daybreak they bring them down, and again they skim off the\n sediment, making the water very thin, and exceedingly wholesome, and then they\n immerse the ewers in straw, and after that they use the water, which has become\n so cold as not to require snow to cool it. And Anaxilas speaks of water\n from cisterns, in his Flute Player, using the allowing expressions:\u2014 \n \n A. I want some water from a cistern now. \n \n B. I have some here, and you are welcome to it. \n \n And, in a subsequent passage, he says\u2014 \n Perhaps the cistern water is all lost. \n But Apollodorus of Gela mentions the cistern itself, \u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, as we call it, in his Female Deserter, saying\u2014\n \n In haste I loosed the bucket of the cistern, \n And then that of the well; and took good care \n To have the ropes all ready to let down. \n \n \n ","98":"\n Myrtilus, hearing this conversation, said,\u2014And I too, being very fond of\n salt-fish, my friends, wish to drink snow, according to the practice of Simonides.\n And Ulpian said,\u2014 The word \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \n fond of salt-fish, is used by Antiphanes, in his Omphale,\n where he says\u2014 \n I am not anxious for salt-fish, my girl. \n But Alexis, in his Gyn\u00e6cocracy, speaks of one man as \u03b6\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, or fond of sauce made from salt-fish,\n saying\u2014 \n But the Cilician here, this Hippocles, \n This epicure of salt-fish sauce, this actor. \n But what you mean by according to the practice of\n Simonides, I do not know. No; for you do not care, said Myrtilus, to\n know anything about history, you glutton; for you are a mere lickplatter; and as\n the Samian poet Asius, that ancient bard, would call you, a flatterer of fat. But\n Callistratus, in the seventh book of his Miscellanies, says that Simonides the\n poet, when feasting with a party at a season of violently hot weather, while the\n cup-bearers were pouring out for the rest of the guests snow into their liquor,\n and did not do so for him, extemporised this epigram:\u2014 \n The cloak with which fierce Boreas clothed the brow \n Of high Olympus, pierced ill-clothed man \n While in its native Thrace; 'tis gentler now, \n Caught by the breeze of the Pierian plain. \n Let it be mine; for no one will commend \n The man who gives hot water to a friend. \n So when he had drunk, Ulpian asked him again where the word \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 is used, and also, what are the lines of\n Asius in which he uses the word \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03be ? These,\n said Myrtilus, are the verses of Asius, to which I alluded:\u2014 \n Lame, branded, old, a vagrant beggar, next \n Came the cnisocolax, when Meles held \n His marriage feast, seeking for gifts of soup, \n Not waiting for a friendly invitation; \n There in the midst the hungry hero stood, \n Shaking the mud from off his ragged cloak. \n \n And the word \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 is\n used by Sophilus, in his Philar- chus, in this passage,\u2014 \n You are a glutton and a fat-licker. \n And in the play which is entitled, The Men running together, he has used\n the word \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03af\u03b1, in the following lines:\u2014\n \n That pandar, with his fat-licking propensities, \n Has bid me get for him this black blood-pudding. \n Antiphanes too uses the word \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \n in his Bombylium. \n Now that men drank also sweet wine while eating is proved by what Alexis says in\n his Dropidas\u2014 \n The courtesan came in with sweet wine laden, \n In a large silver cup, named petachnon, \n Most beauteous to behold. Not a flat dish, \n Nor long-neck'd bottle, but between the two. \n \n \n ","99":"\n After this a cheesecake was served up, made of milk and sesame and honey, which\n the Romans call libum. And Cynulcus said,\u2014Fill yourself now, O Ulpian, with your\n native Chthorodlapsus; a word which is not, I swear by Ceres, used by any one of\n the ancient writers, unless, indeed, it should chance to be found in those who\n have compiled histories of the affairs of Ph\u0153nicia, such as Sanchoniatho and\n Mochus, your own fellow-countrymen. And Ulpian said,\u2014 But it seems to me, you\n dog-fly, that we have had quite enough of honey-cakes: but I should like to eat\n some groats, with a sufficient admixture of the husks and kernels of pinecones.\n And when that dish was brought-Give me, said he, come crust of bread hollowed out\n like a spoon; for I will not say, give me a spoon ( \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ); since that word is not used by any of the writers previous\n to our own time. You have a very bad memory, my friend, quoth Aemilianus; have you\n not always admired Nicander the Colophonian, the Epic poet, as a man very fond of\n ancient authors, and a man too of very extensive learning himself? And indeed, you\n have already quoted him as having used the word \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, for pepper. And this same poet, in\n the first book of his Georgics, speaking of this use of groats, has used also the\n word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, saying\u2014 \n But when you seek to dress a dainty dish \n Of new-slain kid, or tender house-fed lamb, \n Or poultry, take some unripe grains, and pound the \n And strew them all in hollow plates, and stir them, \n \n Mingled with fragrant oil. Then pour thereon \n Warm broth, which take from out the dish before you, \n That it be not too hot, and so boil over. \n Then put thereon a lid, for when they're roasted, \n The grains swell mightily; then slowly eat them, \n Putting them to your mouth with hollow spoon. \n In these words, my fine fellow, Nicander describes to us the way in which\n they ate groats and peeled barley; bidding the eater pour on it soup made of kid\n or lamb, or of some poultry or other. Then, says he, pound the grains in a mortar,\n and having mingled oil with them, stir them up till they boil; and mix in the\n broth made after this recipe as it gets warm, making it thicker with the spoon;\n and do not pour in anything else; but take the broth out of the dish before you,\n so as to guard against any of the more fatty parts boiling over. And it is for\n this reason, too, that he charges us to keep it close while it is boiling, by\n putting the lid on the dish; for that barley grains when roasted or heated swell\n very much. And at last, when it is moderately warm we are to eat it, taking it up\n in hollow spoons. \n And Hippolochus the Macedonian, in his letter to Lynceus, in which he gives an\n account of some Macedonian banquet which surpassed all the feasts which had ever\n been heard of in extravagance, speaks of golden spoons (which he also calls\n \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 ) having been given to each of the\n guests. But since you, my friend, wish to set up for a great admirer of the\n ancients, and say that you never use any expressions which are not the purest\n Attic, what is it that Nicophon says, the poet I mean of the old comedy, in his\n Cherogastores, or the Men who feed themselves by manual Labour? For I find him too\n speaking of spoons, and using the word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \n when he says\u2014 \n Dealers in anchovies, dealers in wine; \n Dealers in figs, and dealers in hides; \n Dealers in meal, and dealers in spoons ( \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 ); \n Dealers in books, and dealers in sieves; \n Dealers in cheesecakes, and dealers in seeds. \n For who can the \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u1ff6\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 be, but the\n men who sell \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 ? So learning from them, my\n fine Syrian-Atticist, the use of the spoon, pray eat your groats, that you may not\n say\u2014 \n But I am languid, weak for want of food. \n \n \n ","100":"\n And I have been surprised at your not asking where The word\n \u03c7\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \n groats, comes from. Whether it is a Me- garian word, or\n whether it comes from Thessaly, as] Myrtilus does. And Ulpian said,\u2014I will stop\n eating if you will tell me by whom these Megarian, or Thessalian groats are spoken\n of. And Aemilianus said,\u2014But I will not refuse you; for seeing a very splendid\n preparation for supper, I wish that you should arm yourself for the fray, being\n filled with barley like a game cock; and I wish you to instruct us about the\n dishes which we are going to partake of. And he, getting out of temper,\n said,\u2014Whence do you get this word \u1f10\u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ? for\n one has no breathing time allowed one while constantly forced to ask these\n questions of these late-learned sophists. But, says Aemilianus, I can easily\n answer you this question; but I will first speak of the word \u03c7\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, quoting you these lines of Antiphanes, out of his Antea,\u2014\n \n \n A. What have you in your baskets there, my\n friend? \n \n B. In three of them I've good Megarian groats. \n \n A. Do they not say Thessalian are the best? \n \n B. I also have some similago fetch'd \n From the far distant land Ph\u0153nicia. \n But the same play is also attributed to Alexis, though in some few places\n the text is a little different. And, again, Alexis says, in his play called The\n Wicked Woman\u2014 \n There's a large parcel of Thessalian groats. \n But Aristophanes, in his Daitaleis, calls soup \u03c7\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, saying\u2014 \n He would boil soup, and then put in a fly, \n And so would give it you to drink. \n He also speaks of similago; and so, though I do not remember his exact\n words, does Strattis, in his Anthroporaistes, or Man-destroyer. And so does\n Alexis, in his Isostasiu. But Strattis uses \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 as the genitive case, in these words\u2014 \n Of these two sorts of gentle semidalis. \n The word \u1f10\u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 is used by Antiphanes,\n in his Twins, where he says\u2014 \n Many nice eatables I have enjoy'd, \n And had now three or four most pleasant draughts; \n And feel quite frisky, eating as much food \n As a whole troop of elephants. \n So now we may bring this book to an end, and let it have its termination with the discussions about eatables; and the next\n book shall begin the description of the Banquet. \n Do not do so, O Athen\u00e6us, before you have told us of the Macedonian banquet of\n Hippolochus.\u2014Well, if this is your wish, O Timocrates, we will prepare to gratify\n it. \n "},"3":{"0":"\n HIPPOLOCHUS the Macedonian, my friend Timocrates, lived in the time of Lynceus and\n Douris of Samos, pupils of Theophrastus the Eresian. And he\n had made a bargain with Lynceus, as one may learn from his letters, that if ever\n he was present at any very expensive banquet, he would relate to him the whole of\n the preparations which were made; and Lynceus in return made him the same promise.\n And there are accordingly some letters of each of them on the subject of banquets;\n in which Lynceus relates the banquet which was given at Athens by Lamia the Attic\n female flute-player to King Demetrius, surnamed Poliorcetes, (and Lamia was the\n mistress of Demetrius.) And Hippolochus reports the marriage feast of Caranus the\n Macedonian. And we have also met with other letters of Lynceus, written to the\n same Hippolochus, giving an account of the banquet of King Antigonus, when he\n celebrated the Aphrodisian festival at Athens, and also that given by King\n Ptolemy. And I will show you the very letters themselves. But as the letter of\n Hippolochus is very scarce, I will run over to you the principal things which are\n contained in it, just for the sake of conversation and amusement at the present\n time. \n ","1":"\n In Macedonia, then, as I have said, Caranus made a marriage feast; and the guests\n invited were twenty in number. And as soon as they had sat down, a silver bowl was\n given to each of them as a present. And Caranus had previously crowned every one\n of them, before they entered the dining-room, with a golden chaplet, and each\n chaplet was valued at five pieces of gold. And when they had emptied the bowls, then there was given to each of the guests a loaf\n in a brazen platter of Corinthian workmanship, of the. same size; and poultry, and\n ducks, and besides that, pigeons, and a goose, and quantities more of the same\n kind of food heaped up abundantly. And each of the guests taking what was set\n before him, with the brazen platter itself also, gave it to the slaves who waited\n behind him. Many other dishes of various sorts were also served up to eat. And\n after them, a second platter was placed before each guest, made of silver, on\n which again there was placed a second large loaf, and on that geese, and hares,\n and kids, and other rolls curiously made, and doves, and turtledoves, and\n partridges, and every other kind of bird imaginable, in the greatest abundance.\n Those also, says Hippolochus, we gave to the slaves; and when we had eaten to\n satiety, we washed our hands, and chaplets were brought in in great numbers, made\n of all sorts of flowers from all countries, and on each chaplet a circlet of gold,\n of about the same weight as the first chaplet. And Hippolochus having stated after\n this that Proteas, the descendant of that celebrated Proteas the son of Lanice,\n who had been the nurse of Alexander the king, was a most extraordinary drinker, as\n also his grandfather Proteas, who was the friend of Alexander, had been; and that\n he pledged every one present, proceeds to write as follows:\u2014 \n ","2":"\n \"And while we were now all amusing ourselves with agreeable trifling, some\n flute-playing women and musicians, and some Rhodian players on the sambuca come\n in, naked as I fancied, but some said that they had tunics on. And they having\n played a prelude, departed; and others came in in succession, each. of them\n bearing two bottles of perfume, bound with a golden thong, and one of the cruets\n was silver and the other gold, each holding a cotyla, and they presented them\n to each of the guests. And then, instead of supper, there was brought in a great\n treasure, a silver platter with a golden edge of no inconsiderable depth, of such\n a size as to receive the entire bulk of a roast boar of huge size, which lay in it\n on his back, showing his belly uppermost, stuffed with many good things. For in\n the belly there were roasted thrushes, and paunches, and a most countless number\n of fig peckers, and the yolks of eggs spread on the top, and oysters, and periwinkles. And to every one of the guests was presented a\n boar stuffed in this way, nice and hot, together with the dish on which he was\n served up. And after this we drank wine, and each of us received a hot kid, on\n another platter like that on which the boar had been served up, with some golden\n spoons. Then Caranus seeing that we were cramped for the want of room, ordered\n canisters and bread-baskets to be given to each of us, made of strips of ivory\n curiously plaited together; and we were very much delighted at all this, and\n applauded the bridegroom, by whose means we were thus enabled to preserve what had\n been given to us. Then chaplets were again brought to us, and another pair of\n cruets of perfume, one silver and one gold, of the same weight as the former pair,\n And when quiet was restored, there entered some men, who even in the Potfeast at\n Athens had borne a part in the solemnities, and with them there came in some\n ithyphallic dancers, and some jugglers, and some conjuring women also, tumbling\n and standing on their heads on swords, and vomiting fire out of their mouths, and\n they, too, were naked. \n ","3":"\n And when we were relieved from their exhibition, then we had a fresh drink offered\n to us, hot and strong, and Thasian, and Mend\u00e6an, and Lesbian wines were placed\n upon the board, very large golden goblets being brought to every one of us. And\n after we had drunk, a glass goblet of two cubits in diameter, placed on a silver\n stand, was served up, full of roast fishes of every imaginable sort that could be\n collected. And there was also given to every one a silver breadbasket full of\n Cappadocian loaves; some of which we ate and some we delivered to the slaves\n behind us. And when we had washed our hands, we put on chaplets; and then again we\n received golden circlets twice as large as the former ones, and another pair of\n cruets of perfume. And when quiet was restored, Proteas leaping up from his couch,\n asked for a cup to hold a gallon; and having filled it with Thasian wine, and\n having mingled a little water with it, he drank it off, saying\u2014 \n He who drinks most will be the happiest. \n And Caranus said\u2014 Since you have been the first to drink, do you be\n the first also to accept the cup as a gift; and this also\n shall be the present for all the rest who drink too. And when this had\n been said, at once nine of the guests rose up snatching at the cups, and each one\n trying to forestall the other. But one of those who were of the party, like an\n unlucky man as he was, as he was unable to drink, sat down and cried because he\n had no goblet; and so Caranus presented him with an empty goblet. After this, a\n dancing party of a hundred men came in, singing an epithalamium in beautiful tune.\n And after them there came in dancing girls, some arranged so as to represent the\n Nereids, and others in the guise of the nymphs. \n ","4":"\n And as the drinking went on, and the shadows were beginning to fall, they opened\n the chamber where everything was encircled all round with white cloths. And when\n these curtains were drawn, the torches appeared, the partitions having been\n secretly removed by mechanism. And there were seen Cupids, and Dianas, and Pans,\n and Mercuries, and numbers of statues of that kind, holding torches in silver\n candlesticks. And while we were admiring the ingenuity of the contrivance, some\n real Erymanthean boars were brought round to each of the guests on square platters\n with golden edges, pierced through and through with silver darts. And what was the\n strangest thing of all was, that those of us who were almost helpless and\n stupefied with wine, the moment that we saw any of these things which were brought\n in, became all in a moment sober, standing upright, as it is said. And so the\n slaves crammed them into the baskets of good omen, until the usual signal of the\n termination of the feast sounded. For you know that that is the Macedonian custom\n at large parties. \n And Caranus, who had begun drinking in small goblets, ordered the slaves to bring\n round the wine rapidly. And so we drank pleasantly, taking our present liquor as a\n sort of antidote to our previous hard drinking. And while we were thus engaged,\n Mandrogenes the buffoon came in, the descendant, as is reported, of that\n celebrated Strato t e Athenian, and he caused us much laughter. And after this he\n danced with his wife, a woman who was already more than eighty years of age. And\n at last the tables, to wind up the whole entertainment, were brought in. And\n sweetmeats in plaited baskets made of ivory were distributed to every one. And cheesecakes of every kind known, Cretan cheesecakes, and\n your Samian ones, my friend Lynceus, and Attic ones, with the proper boxes, or\n dishes, suitable to each kind of confection. And after this we all rose up and\n departed, quite sobered, by Jove, by the thoughts of, and our anxiety about, the\n treasures which we had received. \n But you who never go out of Athens think yourself happy when you hear the precepts\n of Theophrastus, and when you eat thyme, and salads, and nice twisted loaves,\n solemnizing the Len\u00e6an festival, and the Potfeast at the Anthesteria. But at the\n banquet of Caranus, instead of our portions of meat, we carried off actual riches,\n and are now looking, some for houses, and some for lands, and some of us are\n seeking to buy slaves.\" \n ","5":"\n Now if you consider this, my friend Timocrates, with which of the Greek feasts\n that you ever heard of do you think this banquet, which has just been described to\n you, can be compared? When even Antiphanes the comic writer jokingly said in the\n \u0152nomaus, or perhaps it is in the Pelops\u2014 \n What could the Greeks, of sparing tables fond, \n Eaters of salads, do? where you may get \n Four scanty chops or steaks for one small penny. \n But among the ancestors of our nation \n Men roasted oxen, deer, and lambs entire, \n And last of all the cook, outdoing all \n His predecessors, set before the king \n A roasted camel, smoking, hump and all. \n And Aristophanes, in his Acharnians, extolling the magnificence of the\n barbarians, says\u2014 \n \n A. Then he received me, and to dinner ask'd me, \n And set before us whole fat oxen roasted. \n \n B. Who ever saw a roasted ox? The braggart! \n \n A. I'll take my oath he likewise put on table \n A bird three times as burly as Cleonymus; \n Its name, I well remember, was Th' Impostor. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Protesilaus, ridiculing the feast made at the\n marriage of Iphicrates when he married the daughter of Cotys king of the\n Thracians, says\u2014 \n ","6":"\n \n \n If you do this as I bid you, \n You will ask us all to a supper, \n Not to such as that in Thrace, \n Given by Iphicrates\u2014 \n Though, indeed, they say that \n Was a very noble feast. \n \n For that all along the market \n Purple carpets there were spread \n To the northern corner; \n And a countless host of men \n With dirty hands and hair uncomb'd \n Supped on butter. There were too, \n Brazen goblets, large as cisterns, \n Holding plenty for a dozen \n Of the hardest drinkers known. \n Cotys, too, himself was there, \n Girt around, and bearing kindly \n Rich soup in a gold tureen; \n Tasting all the brimming cups, \n So as to be the first to yield \n Of all the guests t' intoxication. \n There was Antigenides \n Delighting all with his soft flute, \n Argas sung, and from Acharn\u00e6 \n Cephisodotus struck the lyre, \n Celebrating Laced\u00e6mon \n And the wide land of the Heraclid\u00e6, \n And at other times they sung \n Of the seven-gated Thebes, \n Changing thus their strain and theme. \n Large was the dowry which 'tis said \n Fell to the lucky bridegroom's share: \n First, two herds of chestnut horses, \n And a herd of horned goats, \n A golden shield, a wide-neck'd bowl, \n A jar of snow, a pot of millet, \n A deep pit full of leeks and onions, \n And a hecatomb of polypi. \n This they say that Cotys did, \n King of Thrace, in heartfelt joy \n At Iphicrates's wedding. \n But a finer feast by far \n Shall be in our master's houses; \n For there's nothing good or fine \n Which our house does stand in need of. \n There is scent of Syrian myrrh, \n There is incense, there is spice; \n There are delicate cakes and loaves, \n Cakes of meal and polypi, \n Tripe, and fat, and sausages, \n Soup, and beet, and figs, and pease, \n Garlic, various kinds of tunnies, \n Ptisan, pulse, and toast and muffins, \n Beans, and various kinds of vetches, \n Honey, cheese, and cheesecakes too, \n Wheat, and nuts, and barley-groats, \n Boasted crabs, and mullets boil'd, \n \n Roasted cuttle-fish, boiled turbot, \n Frogs, and perch, and mussels too, \n Sharks, and roach, and gudgeons too, \n Fish from doves and cuckoos named, \n Plaice, and flounders, shrimps, and rays. \n Then, besides these dainty fish \n There is many another dish,\u2014 \n Honeycombs and juicy grapes, \n Figs and cheesecakes, apples, pears, \n Cornels, and the red pomegranate, \n Poppies, creeping thyme, and parsley, \n Peaches, olives, plums and raisins, \n Leeks and onions, cabbages, \n Strong smelling assaf\u0153tida, \n Fennel, eggs, and lentils cool, \n And well-roasted grasshoppers, \n Cardamums and sesame, \n Ceryces, salt, and limpets firm, \n The pinna, and the oyster bright, \n The periwinkle, and the whelk; \n And besides this a crowd of birds, \n Doves and ducks, and geese and sparrows, \n Thrushes, larks, and jays, and swans, \n The pelican, the crane and stork, \n Wagtails and cousels, tits and finches; \n And to wash all these dainties down \n There's wine, both native and imported, \n White and red, and sweet and acid, \n Still or effervescent. \n \n \n ","7":"\n But Lynceus, in his Centaur, ridiculing the Attic ban- quets, says\u2014 \n \n A. Yon cook, the man who makes the sacrifice \n And seeks now to receive me as my host, \n Is one of Rhodes. And I, the guest invited, \n Am call'd a citizen of fair Perinthus. \n And neither of us likes the Attic suppers; \n For melancholy is an Attic humour; \n May it be always foreign unto me. \n They place upon the table a large platter \n Holding five smaller plates within its space, \n One full of garlic, while another holds \n Two boil'd sea-urchins; in the third, a cake; \n The fourth displays ten cockles to the guest, \n The last has caviar.\u2014While I eat this, \n He falls on that: or while he dines on this, \n I make that other dish to disappear. \n But I would rather eat up both myself, \n Only I cannot go beyond my powers; \n For I have not five mouths, nor twice five lips. \n True, these detain the eyes with various sights, \n \n But looking at them is not eating them: \n I but appease my eyes and not my belly. \n What shall I do then? Have you oysters? Give me \n A plate of them, I beg; and that a large one; \n Have you some urchins. \n \n B. Here's a dish of them \n To which you're welcome; this I bought myself; \n And paid eight obols for it in the market. \n \n A. Put then this dish on table by itself, \n That all may eat the same at once. and not \n One half the guests eat one thing, half another. \n But Dromeas the parasite, when some one once asked him, as Hegesander the\n Delphian relates, whether the banquets in the city or at Chalcis were the best,\n said that the prelude to the banquets at Chalcis was superior to the whole\n entertainment in the city, calling the multitudes of oysters served up, and the\n great variety of fish, the prelude to the banquet. \n ","8":"\n But Diphilus, in his Female Deserter, introduces a cook, and represents him as\n saying\u2014 \n \n A. What is the number of the guests invited \n To this fine marriage feast? And are they all \n Athenian citizens, or are there some \n Foreigners and merchants? \n \n B. What is that to you, \n Since you are but the cook to dress the dinner? \n \n A. It is the first part of my art, O father, \n To know the taste of those who are to eat. \n For instance, if you ask a Rhodian, \n Set a fine shad or lebias before him, \n Well boil'd and hot, the moment that he enters. \n That's what he likes; he'll like it better so \n Than if you add a cup of myrine wine. \n \n A. Well, that idea of shads is not a bad one. \n \n B. Then, if a Byzantine should be your guest, \n Steep all you offer such a man in wormwood. \n And let your dishes taste of salt and garlic. \n For fish are all so plenty in their country, \n That the men all are full of rheum and phlegm \n And Menander says, in his Trophonius\u2014 \n \n A. This feast is for a guest's reception. \n \n B. What guest? whence comes he? for those points,\n believ me, \n Do make a mighty difference to the cook. \n For instance, if some guests from the islands come \n Who always feed on fish of every sort \n Fresh from the sea, such men like not salt dishes, \n But think them make-shifts. Give such men their fool \n Well-season'd, forced, and stuff'd with choicest spices. \n But if you ask a guest from Arcady \n \n He is a stranger to the sea, and loves \n Limpets and shell-fish;-but the rich Ionian \n Will look at nought but Lydian luxuries, \n Rich, stimulating, amatory meats. \n \n \n ","9":"\n The ancients used food calculated to provoke the appetite, as for instance salt\n olives, which they call colymbades: and accordingly Aristophanes says, in his Old\n Age\u2014 \n Old man, do you like flabby courtesans, \n Or tender maidens, firm as well-cured olives? \n And Philemon, in his Follower, or Sauce, says\u2014 \n \n A. What did you think, I pray, of that boiled\n fish? \n \n B. He was but small; do'st hear me? And the\n pickle \n Was white, and much too thick; there was no smell \n Of any spice or seasoning at all, \n So that the guests cried out,\u2014How pure your brine is! \n They also eat common grasshoppers and the monkey grasshopper as\n procreatives of the appetite. Aristophanes says, in his Anagyrus\u2014 \n How can you, in God's name, like grasshoppers, \n Catching them with a reed, and cercopes? \n \n But the cercope is a little animal like a grasshopper or prickly roach,\n as Speusippus tells us in the fourth book of his Similitudes; and Epilycus\n mentions them in his Coraliscus. And Alexis says in his Thrason\u2014 \n I never saw, not even a cercope \n A greater chatterer than you, O woman, \n Nor jay, or nightingale, or dove, or grasshopper. \n And Nicostratus says, in his Abra\u2014 \n The first, a mighty dish shall lead the way, \n Holding an urchin, and some sauce and capers, \n A cheesecake, fish, and onions in rich stuffing. \n \n \n ","10":"\n And that they used to eat, for the sake of encouraging the appetite, rape dressed\n with vinegar and mustard, is plainly stated by Nicander, in the second book of his\n Georgics, where he says\u2014 \n The rape is a mix'd breed from radishes; \n It's grown in garden beds, both long and stiff; \n One sort they wash and dry in the north wind, \n A friend to winter and to idle servants: \n Then it revives when soak'd in water warm. \n Cut thou the roots of rape, and gently scrape \n \n The not yet juiceless rind in shavings thin; \n Then dry them in the sun a little while, \n Then dip them in hot water, and in brine, \n And pack them closely; or at other times \n Pour in new wine and vinegar, half and half, \n Into one vessel, and put salt on the top. \n And often 'twill be well to pound fresh raisins, \n And add them gently, scattering in some seeds \n Of biting mustard; and some dregs of vinegar, \n To reach the head and touch the vigorous brain: \n A goodly dish for those who want a dinner. \n And Diphilus or Sosippus, in the Female Deserter, says\u2014 \n Have you now any sharp fresh vinegar? \n I think, too, we've some fig-tree juice, my boy. \n In these I'll press the meat as tight as may be; \n And some dried herbs I'll spread around the dish; \n For of all condiments these do most surely \n The body's sensitive parts and nerves excite. \n They drive away unpleasant heaviness, \n And make the guests sit down with appetite. \n \n \n ","11":"\n And Alexis, in his Tarentines, when speaking of their banquets, says that the\n Athenians used to dance at their drinking parties\u2014 \n \n A. For this now is a common native practice. \n At the divine and all accomplish'd Athens. \n They all rise up and dance together when \n The first sweet scent of wine doth reach their nostrils. \n \n B. You tell me of a strange and novel custom. \n \n A. So you would say, indeed, if unexpected \n You on a sudden dropp'd in at a feast; \n And beardless boys are sure to meet with favour; \n But when I see that rogue Theodotus, \n Or some impure and cheating parasite, \n Affecting nice and delicate airs, such loathing \n Does seize me, that I'd gladly seize the man, \n And nail him to the vilest cross. \n And Antiphanes, in his Carians, with reference to the Attic fashion of\n dancing, turns one of the sophists into ridicule, as dancing at a banquet, in the\n following verses\u2014 \n Do you not see that eunuch capering, \n Waving his hands, no signs of shame he shows; \n He who was lecturing us on Heraclitus, \n The only master of Theodectes' school, \n The spouter of Euripides's proverbs. \n And it will not be foreign to the subject to quote here what is said by\n Eriphus the comic poet, in his \u0152olus\u2014 \n \n For 'tis an ancient proverb, and a wise one; \n That old men seek for wine to make them dance, \n Spite of their age, against their will, my father. \n And Alexis, in the play entitled Isostasium, says\u2014 \n They drank in picnic fashion, only seeking \n For some excuse to dance. There was the name \n Of meat and vegetables; fish, and crabs, \n Gudgeon and tench, and similago fine. \n \n \n ","12":"\n But Matron the parodist, says Plutarch, has given a very agreeable account of an\n Attic banquet; and as it is very rare I will not scruple, my friends, to repeat it\n to you\u2014 \n The feast for much and varied food renown'd, \n Given by Xenocles, O Muse, resound; \n \n For when at Athens he his cards sent round, \n I went invited, hungry as a hound. \n What loaves I saw, how large, how round, how fine, \u2014 \n So white, on them alone one well might dine! \n Boreas, enamour'd of the well-baked train, \n Gazed on them fondly; while along the plain \n The stately Xenocles survey'd the ground, \n And placed the guests the goodly board around. \n Near him the parasite Ch\u00e6rephoon stood, \n And like a cormorant gazed upon the food, \n \n Ever at other's cost well pleased to eat: \n Meanwhile the cooks prepared the dainty treat, \n The skilful cooks, to whom is given all sway \n The sumptuous feast to quicken or delay. \n Then all the rest the herbs and greens did seize, \n But me the solid meats did rather please; \n Rich oysters guarded in their solid shell, \n While to Ph\u0153nician-brine I said farewell; \n And threw away the urchin's tasteless meat, \n Which rattled falling at the servant's feet, \n Loud as the waves the rocky shore which flout, \n \n While they in fun the prickly spines pull'd out. \n There came th' anchovy of Phaleric race \n Holding a dirty veil before its face, \n \n Friend of the Triton, to the Cyclops dear; \n * * * * * \n And pinna's sweet, and cockles fat were there \n Which the wave breeds beneath its weedy bed \n The gristly turbot, and the mullet red. \n First in the fray on them I laid my hand, \n And called on Ph\u0153bus, by his slave to stand; \n But when Stratocles, scorning fear, I saw \n Hold in his hand the mullet's luscious jaw, \n \n I seized it too, and while it came apart, \n Quick with the dainty bit rejoiced my heart. \n There, too, the silver-footed Thetis came, \n The fair-hair'd cuttle-fish, the mighty dame, \n Fairest of Nereus' daughters, none but she \n Of fish can both with black and white agree. \n \n There, too, the conger, Tityos of the main, \n Lay on nine tables and o'erspread the plain. \n \n Next came the eel, who charm'd the mighty Jove, \n And soften'd his stern soul to tender love. \n So mighty that two wrestlers, of the days \n Of old Astyanax, could scarcely raise \n Her from the ground and place her on the board, \n Nine fathoms long, and full nine cubits broad. \n Up stairs, down stairs the busy cooks did haste, \n While more fresh dishes on the board they placed. \n Next forty large black pots appear'd in view, \n And forty platters from Eub\u0153a too. \n Then various Iris, Jove's commands to bear, \n In shape of cuttle-fish flew through the air. \n The shining perch, the black tail next appear'd; \n A mortal fish to join immortals dared. \n Alone, apart in discontented mood, \n A gloomy dish, the sullen tunny stood; \n \n For ever sad with proud disdain he pined, \n And the lost arms for ever stung his mind. \n The shark, to masons and upholders dear, \n Good nurse of youth, though rough its skin appear; \n \n Nor do I know on earth a nicer food, \n Though what came next is very near as good, \n A roasted cestreas; nor alone it lay, \n For twelve fine sargi came the self-same way. \n \n And a dark amias, of every sea \n Who knows the depths, great Neptune's comrade he. \n And squills the minstrels of Olympian Jove, \n Whom none to look at, all to taste of, love. \n The chrysophrys, for shining beauty famed, \n The crab's hard shell refusing to be tamed. \n All these, and many more besides, I saw \n Crush'd in each hungry guest's devouring jaw. \n The royal sturgeon led the second band, \n Towards whom, though nearly full, I stretch'd my hand; \n He like ambrosia to my senses look'd, \n Which I had always thought for gods alone was cookd. \n Then came alamprey, large and richly fed, \n As when he seeks the dragon's daughter's bed. \n And next, (the goddesses such sandals wear,) \n Of mighty soles a firm and well-match'd pair. \n \n Then the sea thrushes young and fierce, who dive \n Mid the deep rocks and tear their prey alive. \n The sargus, mormyrus, hippurus, spar, \n The shad, the gale; so countless fishes are. \n The feast to view the guests' eyes joyful beam'd, \n And all the house with the rich odour steam'd. \n The host bade all sit down: myself, I thought \n This woman's food, and something solid sought. \n Large in the centre lay a vacant space, \n Which herbs and salads did with verdure grace. \n Then a sea blackbird came, a morsel nice, \n And disappear'd, devoured in a trice. \n Then came a ham, t' its foes a helpless prey, \n And while it lasted none could keep away. \n But when the feast was o'er I wept with sorrow \n To think I could not eat on till to-morrow, \n But must fall back on barley-meal and cheese. \n * * * * * * \n Black broth subdued him and boil'd pettitoes; \n Then came some ducks from Salamis, sacred isle, \n Borne by the cook, who with a cheerful smile, \n Marshall'd them where the Athenian phalanx stood; \n And Ch\u00e6rephon survey'd the various food, \n That he might know to choose and eat the best; \n Then like a lion leapt he on the feast, \n \n And seized a mighty leg of turkey hot, \n To make his supper when he home had got. \n Then groats which Vulcan made into a cake, \n And in Attic pan full thirteen months did bake \n But when our wish for food was satisfied, \n We wash'd our hands in ocean's foaming tide; \n One beauteous slave came round with rich perfume, \n Another garlands strew'd around the room. \n Then foam'd around old Bacchus' rosy tide, \n And each guest merrily with his fellow vied. \n Then the dessert was served; the juicy pear, \n The apple and pomegranate too were there. \n The grape, the nurse of Bacchus, and the plum, \n And fig, and medlar on the table come. \n But I ate nought, I was so full before, \n Till I that lovely child of Ceres saw, \n A large sweet round and yellow cake; how then \n Could I from such a dish, my friends, abstain? \n Had I ten mouths, aye, and as many hands, \n A brazen stomach within brazen bands, \n \n They all would on that lovely cake have sprung. \n And so the feast of Stratocles I've sung. \n \n \n ","13":"\n And Alexis, in his Men running together, ridiculing the Attic banquets, says\u2014 \n \n I wish that I could get a brace of cooks, \n The cleverest in their art in all the city. \n For he who a Thessalian would invite, \n Lust never stint his fare in Attic fashion, \n Nor practise over strict economy; \n But have in all things a well-order'd feast. \n And the Thessalians are truly fond of eating; as Eriphus says in his\n Light-armed Soldier, thus\u2014 \n It is not Corinth now, nor Lais here, \n Nor any feast of sumptuous Thessalians, \n Whose habits well I know. \n And the author, whoever he was, of the play called The Beggars, which is\n ascribed to Chionides, says that the Athenians, when they place a banquet for\n Castor and Pollux in their Prytaneum, serve up on the tables cheese and\n barley-cakes, and olives which have fallen, and leeks, for the sake of reminding\n people of the ancient manner of living. And Solon enjoins them to serve up\n barley-cakes to those who eat in the prytaneum: and besides that, to place bread\n on the table at festivals, in imitation of Homer; for he, too, when collecting the\n chiefs around Agamemnon, says\u2014 \n The cakes were baked. \n And Chrysippus, in the fourth book of his treatise on Beauty and\n Pleasure, says\u2014 But at Athens they say that two festivals are celebrated\n there (neither of them of great antiquity), one at the Lyceum and one in the\n Academy, and when the confectioner had brought into the Academy a dish for some\n other purpose, all those who were offering sacrifice at once broke the dish,\n because something had been introduced which did not belong to the city, and\n everything which came from afar ought to have been kept away. And that the cook\n at the Lyceum having prepared some Salt-fish in order to serve up a dish of it,\n was scourged as a man who used his invention in a very wicked manner. \n And Plato, in the second book of his Republic, represents his new citizens as\n feasting, and writes\u2014 You make your men feast without any second course,\n says he. You say the truth, I replied; I forgot that they will have a second\n course-namely, salt, and olives, and cheese, and onions; and besides, they will\n boil such vegetables as are found in the fields; and moreover, we shall serve\n up some sweetmeats to them,\u2014figs, and beans, and vetches. They shall roast\n myrtle-berries too and beechc acorns at the fire, drinking\n moderately all the time. And in this manner they shall pass their lives in\n peace, growing old, as it is probable they will, in the enjoyment of good\n health, and transmit a good constitution to their posterity. \n \n ","14":"\n We must next speak of the Laced\u00e6monian banquets. Now Herodotus, in the ninth book\n of his Histories, speaking of the preparation of Mardonius, and mentioning the\n banquets of the Laced\u00e6monians, says\u2014 Xerxes, when fleeing from Greece, left\n all his equipment to Mardonius. And when Pausanias beheld the appointments of\n Mardonius's tent, and his tent itself all furnished with gold and silver and\n embroidered curtains, he ordered the bakers and confectioners to prepare him a\n supper exactly as they had been in the habit of preparing for Mardonius. And\n when they had done as they were commanded, Pausanias, beholding the couches of\n gold and silver all ready laid and covered, and the silver tables, and the\n superb banquet which was prepared, marvelling at what he saw, by way of\n ridicule ordered his own slaves to prepare a banquet in the Laced\u00e6monian\n fashion. But when it was made ready, Pausanias laughed, and sent for all the\n generals of the Greeks; and when they were come he showed them both the\n banquets which were prepared before him, and said: O Greeks, I have assembled\n you, because I was desirous to exhibit to you the folly of the general of the\n Medes; who, while he was used himself to live in the manner which you behold,\n came against us who are in the habit of living in the hard way which you see\n here. \n \n And some say that a citizen of Sybaris, who was staying at Sparta, and who dined\n at their Phiditia, said\u2014 It is natural enough for the Laced\u00e6monians to be\n the bravest of men; for any man in his senses would rather die ten thousand\n times over, than live in such a miserable way as this. \n \n ","15":"\n And Polemo, in his treatise on the Wicker Carriage mentioned by Xenophon, says\n \"that Cratinus in his Pluti, mentioning the feast which is called by the\n Laced\u00e6monians Copis, speaks as follows\u2014 \n Tell me, I pray you, is it true that all \n The strangers in that country, who arrive, \n May banquet at the Copis at their pleasure \n And at their parties do there hang around \n Cakes fix'd on pegs, that every one who will, \n Young men and old, may take a bite at them? \n \n And Eupolis says in his Helots\u2014 \n And let a Copis be this day prepared. \n \n \n Now the Copis is a peculiar sort of entertainment, just as that which is called\n Aiclon. And when it tales place, first of all they erect tents near the temple of\n the good; and in them they place beds of leaves; and on them they strew carpets,\n and then they feast those who recline on them, not only those who arrive, being\n natives of the country, but those foreigners also who are sojourning in the place.\n And at these copides they sacrifice goats, but no other victim; and they give\n portions of its flesh to every one, and they distribute also what they call a\n physicillus, which is a little loaf like an encris, made of oil and honey, only\n rounder in shape. And they give to every one who is present a newly made cheese,\n and a slice of paunch, and black-pudding, and sweet-meats, and dried. figs, and\n beans, and green kidney-beans. And any one of the rest of the Spartans who\n chooses, partakes of this Copis. \n \n They also celebrate copides in the city at the festival called\n Tithenidia, which is celebrated on\n behalf of the children. For the nurses at this season bring the male children\n into the fields, and to the Diana surnamed Corythallia; whose temple is near\n the fountain called Tiassus, in the parts towards Cleta; and there they\n celebrate copides, in a manner similar to those which have been already\n mentioned. And they sacrifice small sucking-pigs, and they also at the feast\n set before the guests some of the loaves called ipnit\u00e6. But this aiclon is\n called by all the other Dorians \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. At all\n events Epicharmus, in his Hope, says\u2014 \n For some one of his own accord has ask'd you to an \u03b1\u1f36\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \n \n And do thou gladly go in haste of your accord to eat it. \n And he repeats the same lines in his Periallus. But at Laced\u00e6mon,\n after supper is over, they set what they call \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (not \u03b1\u1f36\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) before all\n those who come to the Phiditium; namely, loaves of bread in a small basket, and\n a slice of meat for each person. And an attendant follows the servant who\n distributes the portions, proclaiming the \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, adding to his proclamation the name of him who has sent\n it round. \n \n ","16":"\n This was the statement of Polemo. But Didymus the Grammarian contradicted him,\n (and Demetrius, of Tr\u0153zen, calls him a Bookforgetter, on account of the number of\n books which he has edited, for they amount to three thousand\n and five hundred,) and said\u2014\"Polycrates, in his history of Laced\u00e6monian affairs,\n relates that the Laced\u00e6monians celebrate the festival called Hyacinthia for three\n days, and on account of their lamentation for Hyacinthus, they do not wear crowns\n at their feasts, nor do they bring bread there, but they distribute cheesecakes,\n and other things of the same kind. And they sing no paean to the god, nor do they\n introduce anything of that sort, as they do in other sacred festivals, but they\n eat their supper in a very orderly manner, and then depart. But on the middle one\n of the three days there is a very superb spectacle, and a very considerable and\n important assembly; for boys play upon the harp, girt up in their tunics, and\n singing to the music of the flute, running over all the strings of the harp at the\n same time with the plectrum, in an anap\u00e6stic rhythm, with a shrill tone, and in\n that manner they sing a hymn in honour of the god. And others riding on horses and\n handsomely dressed go through the theatre; and very numerous choruses of young men\n enter, and they sing some of their native poems. And dancers mingled with them\n perform an ancient sort of dance to the music of a flute and singing. And virgins\n also, some in wooden curved chariots, called canathra, beautifully made, and\n others in crowds of large waggons drawn by horses, make a procession; and the\n whole city is in a state of agitation and of delight at the spectacle. And they\n sacrifice great numbers of victims all this day. And the citizens give a banquet\n to all their friends, and to their own slaves; and no one omits attending the\n sacred feast, but the whole city is evacuated by the whole body of citizens\n flocking to the spectacle. \n \n And the copis is also mentioned by Aristophanes or Philyllius in the\n Cities, and by Epilycus in the Coraliscus, where he says\u2014 \n When I shall bear a copis to the fane \n Of sacred Amycl\u00e6, then many baraces, \n And loaves, and luscious sauce shall show my coming: \n saying expressly that barley-cakes are set before the guests at the\n copides, (for that is the meaning of the word \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, which does not mean cheesecakes, as Lycophron asserts,\n nor barley-meal porridge, as Eratosthenes believes,) and loaves, and a\n particular sort of broth very highly seasoned. More- over, what the copis is,\n is very perspicuously explained by Molpis in his treatise\n on the Polity of the Laced\u00e6monians, where he writes, They also have feasts\n which they call copides. But the copis is a supper consisting of barley-cakes,\n loaves, meat, raw vegetables, soup, figs, sweetmeats, and warmed wine.\n Moreover, sucking-pigs are not called \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9, as Polemo pronounces the word, but \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9, since they are sold at early dawn\n ( \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f44\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ), as Pers\u00e6us relates in his\n treatise on the Laced\u00e6monian Polity. And Dioscorides, in the second book of his\n Polity, and Aristocles, in the first book of the treatise which he also wrote\n concerning the Laced\u00e6monian Polity, make the same statement. Besides, Polemo\n says, that supper is called \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd by the\n Laced\u00e6monians, and that all the rest of the Dorians give it the same name. For\n Alcman says\u2014 \n At the mill and also at the suppers ( \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2\n \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 ), \n where he uses \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 as\n equivalent to \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1. And in a subsequent\n passage he says\u2014 \n Alcman prepared an \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n But the Laced\u00e6monians do not call that portion which is given after\n the supper \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, nor that which is given\n after supper at the phiditia; for that consists of bread and meat: but that is\n called \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, being, as it were, an addition\n to the \u1f04\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, which is regularly appointed as\n a part of the phiditia; and that is what I imagine the name implies. For the\n preparation of what is called the \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 is\n not simple, as Polemo supposed, but of a two-fold nature. For that which they\n give to the boys is very slight and trifling, being merely meal steeped in oil,\n which Nicocles, the Laced\u00e6monian, says that they eat after supper, wrapped up\n in leaves of the bay-tree, from which those leaves are called \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n and the cakes themselves are called\n \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. And that it was a custom of the\n ancients to eat the leaves of the bay-tree at dessert, Callias or Diocles\n asserts in the Cyclopes, speaking thus\u2014 \n You will eat the leaves meant for supper, \n And this belongs to the figures which . . . \n But what they serve up at the phiditia of the men is prepared of some\n few regular animals, one of those who are rich men providing them for the\n phiditia, or sometimes several men club together to furnish it. But Molpis\n tells u that the \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 are also surnamed\n \u03bc\u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7. \n \n \n \n ","17":"\n But concerning the \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1, Pers\u00e6us, in his\n treatise on the Laced\u00e6monian Constitution, writes as follows:\u2014 And\n immediately he levies on the rich men a tax of money to provide the \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 ; and this word means the sweetmeats which\n come on after supper. But he enjoins the poor to bring a reed, or a straw, or a\n leaf of the bay-tree, in order that they may be able to eat the \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 after supper. For it consists of meal steeped\n in oil; and this is wholly like the arrangement of some small state. For in\n these \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 they attend to all such points as\n these: who ought to sit down first, or second, or who ought to sit down on a\n small couch; and so on. And Dioscorides gives the same account. But\n concerning the words \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 Nicocles writes as follows:\u2014 But the\n Ephor, having heard the cause, pronounces an acquittal or a condemnation. And\n he who has gained the cause is slightly taxed to provide some \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 or \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. Now the \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 are\n cakes; but the \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 are what they wrap\n them in in order to eat them. \n \n ","18":"\n But concerning the banquet of the Phiditia, Dioscorides gives this account in his\n book entitled Tripoliticus. In the first place, each individual has his\n supper put down separately before him, and he has no participation with any one\n else; and after that each has as much barley-cake as he pleases. And again, a\n cup is placed before each person, to drink whenever he pleases. And the meat is\n always the same for every one, being boiled pork; but sometimes they have no\n meat at all, except some little bit weighing at the outside about four min\u00e6;\n and besides this, nothing at all except the broth which comes from it; which is\n sufficient for every one at the whole banquet to have some. And sometimes there\n may be some olives, or some cheese, or a few figs: and sometimes they have some\n small addition\u2014a fish, or a hare, or a pigeon, or something of that sort: and\n then, after they have eaten very rapidly, the things are brought round which\n are called \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1. And every one contributes\n to the phiditium about three Attic semimedimni of\n meal, and about eleven or twelve choes of\n wine; and in addition to this they contributed a certain weight of cheese and\n figs; and moreover, for purchasing meat, they gave ten Aeginetan obols. \n \n \n \n But Sph\u00e6rus, in the third book of his treatise on the Laced\u00e6monian Constitution,\n writes\u2014 The partakers of the phiditium do also themselves contribute the\n \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1. And sometimes most of them make\n their contributions consist of what has been caught by them in hunting. Not but\n what the rich contribute also bread and whatever vegetables or fruits may be in\n season, in such quantities as are sufficient for one meal; thinking that to\n provide more than is just enough is superfluous, as it will not be\n eaten. And Molpis says\u2014 But after the supper is over something is\n always contributed by some one or other, and sometimes by many joining\n together; and the \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7, which they call the\n \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, is prepared by them at their own\n houses: but no one goes to any expense in buying what he contributes for this\n purpose. For they do not contribute it for the purpose of giving pleasure, or\n of indulging in any immoderate eating, but with the view of making a display of\n their own skill in hunting. And many also who breed flocks of sheep, give their\n produce very liberally. And this \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 \n consists of pigeons, geese, two hen-doves, thrushes, blackbirds, hares, lambs,\n kids. And the cooks always proclaim the name of him who has contributed each\n dish, in order that all men may see his devotion to hunting, and his eagerness\n to contribute to their enjoyment. \n \n But Demetrius the Scepsian says, in the first book of his treatise on the Trojan\n Array, that the festival of the Carnea among the Laced\u00e6monians is a\n representation of a military expedition. For that there are nine spots marked\n out; and they are called sciades, having something like\n tents in them; and in each of them nine men sup; and everything is proclaimed\n by the crier as if it were a military order. Now each scias has three phratri\u00e6.\n And this festival of the Carnea lasts nine days. \n \n ","19":"\n Subsequently the Laced\u00e6monians relaxed the rigour of this way of living, and\n became more luxurious. At all events, Phylarchus, in the fifteenth and again in\n the twentieth book of his Histories, writes thus concerning them:\u2014 The\n Laced\u00e6monians had given up assembling for the phiditia, according to the custom\n of their country, and whenever they met, after having had a few things brought\n round, for the sake of a seeing compliance with the law, other thins were then\n prepared; couches furnished in a very expensive way and\n of exceeding size, and all differing from one another in their adornment; so\n that some of the strangers who were invited used to be afraid to put their\n elbows on the pillows; and those who formerly used to rest on a bare bench\n during the whole banquet, perhaps once leaning on their elbows for a few\n minutes, had now come to such a pitch of luxury as I have spoken of, and to a\n serving up of many cups of wine, and of all sorts of food procured from all\n countries and dressed in every kind of luxurious way; and besides that, they\n had come to use foreign perfumes, and also foreign wines and sweetmeats. And\n the people began this fashion who lived a short time before the reign of\n Cleomenes, namely Areus and Acrotatus, rivalling the indulgences of the court\n of Persia; and they in their turn were so far exceeded by some private\n individuals, who lived in Sparta at that time, in their own personal\n extravagance, that Areus and Acrotatus appeared people of such rigid economy as\n to have surpassed the most simple of their predecessors in self-denial. \n \n ","20":"\n \n But Cleomenes was a man of eminent wisdom in his discernment of matters,\n (although he was but a young man,) and also was exceedingly simple in his\n manner of life. For he, being king, and having such important affairs intrusted\n to his management, displayed such behaviour to any who were invited to any\n sacrifice, as to make them see that what they had daily prepared at home for\n themselves was in no respect inferior to what he allowed himself. And when many\n embassies were sent to him he never made a banquet for the ambassadors at an\n earlier hour than the regular time; and there never was anything more laid than\n a common pentaclinum; and when there was no embassy, what was laid was a\n triclinium. And there were no orders issued by the regulator of the feasts, as\n to who should come in or who should sit down first: but the eldest led the way\n to the couch, unless he himself invited any one else to do so; and he was\n generally seen supping with his brother or with some of his friends of his own\n age. And there was placed on a tripod a brazen wine-cooler, and a cask, and a\n small silver cup holding two cotyle, and a cyathus; and the spoon was made of brass. And wine\n was not brought round to drink unless any one asked for it; but one cyathus was\n given to each guest before supper: and generally it was given to himself first;\n and then, when he had thus given the signal, the rest also asked for some wine.\n But what was served up was placed on a very common-looking table; and the\n dishes were such that there was neither anything left, nor anything deficient,\n but just a sufficient quantity for every one; so that those who were present\n should not feel the want of anything. For he did not think it right to receive\n guests as sparingly, in respect of soup and meat, as men are treated at the\n phiditia; nor again, to have so much superfluity as to waste money for no\n purpose, exceeding all moderation and reason in the feast; for the one extreme\n he counted illiberal, and the other arrogant. And the wine was of rather a\n better quality when he had any company. But while they were eating they all\n kept silence; but a slave stood by, holding in his hand a vessel of mixed wine,\n and poured out for every one who asked for it. And in the same manner, after\n supper there was given to each guest not more than two cyathi of wine, and this\n too was brought to each person as he made a sign for it. And there was no music\n of any kind accompanying the meal, but Cleomenes himself conversed all the time\n with each individual, having invited them, as it were, for the purpose of\n listening and talking; so that all departed charmed with his hospitality and\n affability. \n \n But Antiphanes, ridiculing the Laced\u00e6monian banquets, in the style of the comic\n poets, in his drama which is entitled Archon, speaks as follows:\u2014 \n If you should live in Laced\u00e6mon's walls, \n You must comply with all their fashions there. \n Go to their spare phiditia for supper, \n And feast on their black broth; and not disdain \n To wear fierce whiskers, and seek no indulgence \n Further than this; but keep the olden customs, \n Such as their country doth compel. \n \n \n ","21":"\n And concerning the Cretan banquets, or \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1, \n Dosiades speaks in the fourth book of his treatie on Cretan Affairs, speaking as\n follows:\u2014 But the Lyctians collect men for the common meal ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 ) of the nation in this way:\u2014 Every one\n brings a tenth part of the fruits which his land produces and throws into the\n common stock of the mess; and they also bring their share\n of the taxes due to the city, which the chief magistrates of the city\n distribute among each separate family. And each one of the slaves pays an\n Aeginetan stater a head. The citizens are all divided into messes; and they call them\n \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1. And a woman has the superintendence\n of their meals, having-three or four of the people under her to obey her\n orders. Now each one of the company is followed by two servants bearing wood;\n and their title is calophori. And there are in every town of Crete two houses\n set apart for these \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, one of which\n they call the men's house, and the other, that, namely, in which they receive\n strangers, they call the sleeping house. And in the house which is set apart\n for these public meals, there are first of all two tables set out, called the\n strangers' tables, at which those foreigners who are present sit; and after\n that tables are laid for the rest. And the younger men have half the quantity\n of meat; and they touch none of the other dishes. Then a bowl of wine is placed\n on each table, mingled with water; and all drink of this in common at the\n common table; and when they have finished supper then another bowl is put on\n the table. But for the boys one common bowl is likewise mixed; but the elders\n have liberty to drink more if they feel inclined to. And the woman who has the\n superintendence of the mess takes away from off the table, without any disguise\n or concealment, the best of what is served up, and puts it before those who are\n distinguished for warlike achievements or for wisdom. And when they have\n finished supper, then, first of all, they are in the habit of deliberating on\n the affairs of the state; and then, after that, they converse about exploits\n which have been performed in war, and extol those who have behaved like valiant\n men, and so exhort the younger men to acts of valour and virtue. \n \n And Pyrgion, in the third book of his treatise on Cretan Laws, says\u2014 At\n their public meals the Cretans sit and feast merrily. And those who are orphans\n have dishes served up to them without any seasoning; and the youngest of them\n minister to the others; and having uttered words of good omen they pour\n libations to the gods, and distribute the dishes served up to all the guests.\n They distribute some also to the sons who are sitting just behind the seat of\n their fathers; giving them one-half as much as is given to\n men; but the orphans have an equal share. And whatever is served up to them has\n no seasoning nor any luxurious mixtures compounded in it. There were also three\n seats designed for strangers, and a third table, on the right hand side as you\n went in to the house where the men ate; and that they called the table of the\n Jupiter of Hospitality, and the table of Hospitality. \n \n ","22":"\n And Herodotus, comparing the drinking parties of the Greeks with the banquets in\n fashion among the Persians, says\u2014 But the Persians are accustomed to honour\n that day above all others on which they were born. And on that day they think\n it right to have a more splendid feast than on any other day. And on that day\n those of them who are rich serve up an ox, and an ass, and a horse, and a\n camel, all roasted whole in ovens: but those who are poor serve up only the\n smaller animals, such as sheep; and they do not eat a great deal of meat, but\n great quantities of sweetmeats, and no salt. And on this account the Persians\n say that the Greeks, when they eat, leave off being still hungry, because after\n supper nothing is served up to them worth speaking of. For that if anything\n good were put before them they would not leave off eating it: but they sit very\n long at their wine. And it is not allowed to them to vomit, nor to make water\n in the presence of one another. And these laws are strictly observed among\n them. And after they have drunk hard they are accustomed to deliberate on the\n most important affairs. And whatever they determine on at these deliberations,\n the next day the master of the house, wherever they were when they deliberated,\n proposes to them over again when they are quite sober; and if they adopt the\n same determination when sober, then they act upon it, but if not, they a\n abandon it: and whatever they decide on when sober, they reconsider when they\n are drunk. \n \n ","23":"\n But concerning the luxury of the kings among the Persians, Xenophon, in his\n Agesilaus, writes as follows:\u2014 For men travel over the whole earth in the\n service of the king of Persia, looking to find out what may be pleasant for him\n to drink; and ten thousand men are always contriving something nice for him to\n eat; and no one can tell the number of contrivances they propose to cause him\n to sleep well. But Agesilaus, because he was a man fond of\n exertion, drank whatever was set before him with pleasure, and ate whatever\n came across him with appetite; and every place suited him to sleep pleasantly\n in. And in his treatise entitled Hiero, speaking of the things which\n are prepared for kings, and also of the dishes which are prepared for private\n individuals to eat, he uses the following expressions:\u2014 ' And I know,' said\n he, ' O Simonides, that most men consider that we eat and drink more pleasantly\n than private individuals in this respect, because they think that they should\n more gladly eat of what is served up to us than of what is set before them. For\n that whatever is out of the ordinary routine gives pleasure; on which account\n all men gladly receive invitations to festivals, except kings. For as their\n tables are always loaded to satiety, it is quite impossible that they should be\n susceptible of any addition at the time of feasts; so that in this particular\n pleasure which is derived from hope they are surpassed by private individuals.\n And in the next place,' he continued, ' I am sure that you yourself know from\n experience that the more any one sets before people that which is more than\n sufficient, in that exact proportion is a disgust at eating quicker in coming\n on; so that a man who has a very large and varied dinner set before him is\n inferior to those who live moderately also in the duration of his pleasure.'\n 'But, by Jove,' said Simonides, as long as the mind feels an appetite, so long\n are those who are bred up amid more expensive preparations delighted in a much\n higher degree than those who are in the habit of living in a most economical\n manner.' \n \n ","24":"\n But Theophrastus, in the Book on Royal Authority, addressed to Cassander, (if\n indeed the book under that title, attributed to him, be a genuine work of his, for\n many say that it was written by Sosibius, to whom Callimachus the poet addresses a\n triumphal hymn in elegiac metre,) says that the Persian kings were so\n luxurious as to offer by proclamation a large sum of money to any one who could\n invent any new pleasure. And Theopompus, in the thirty-fifth book of\n his Histories, says, that the king of the Paphlagonians, whose name was\n Thys, whenever he supped, ordered a hundred dishes of every sort to be placed\n on his table, beginning with oxen. And that when he was led captive to the king\n of Persia and kept in prison, he still continued to have the same profusion served up to him, living in the most splendid manner. So that\n Artaxerxes, when he heard of it, said that he appeared to him to be living like\n a man who knew that he should soon die. But the same Theopompus, in the\n fourteenth book of his History of the Exploits of Philip, says\u2014 When the\n king comes to any one of his subject cities, twenty talents are expended on his\n supper, and sometimes thirty; and some even spend a much larger sum still. For\n it is a very old custom, that every city is bound to supply a supper in\n proportion to its greatness, just on the same principle as its tribute to the\n revenue and its taxes are exacted. \n \n ","25":"\n But Heraclides the Cum\u00e6an, who compiled a history of Persia, in the second book of\n that work, which is entitled Preparatory, says\u2014 And those who wait upon the\n Persian kings while they are at supper, all minister after having bathed,\n wearing beautiful clothes; and they remain nearly half the day in attendance at\n the feast. But of those who are invited to eat with the king, some dine\n outside, and every one who chooses can see them, but some dine inside with the\n king: and even these do not actually eat with him; but there are two rooms\n opposite to one another, in one of which the king eats his meal, and in the\n other the guests eat theirs. And the king beholds them through the curtain\n which is at the door; but they cannot see him. But sometimes, when there is a\n feast, then they all sup in one room, namely, in the same room as the king,\n being the large room. And when the king has a drinking party, (and he has one\n very often,) his guests are about a dozen in number, and when they have supped,\n the king by himself, and his guests by themselves, then one of the eunuchs\n summons those who are to drink, with the king: and when they come, then they\n drink with him, but they do not have the same wine; also they sit on the ground\n and he reclines on a couch with golden feet; and when they are very drunk\n indeed they go away. But for the most part the king breakfasts and sups by\n himself: but sometimes his wife sups with him; and sometimes some of his sons\n do so. And at supper his concubines sing and play to him; and one of them\n leads, and then all he rest sing in concert. But the supper, he\n continues, which is called the king's supper, will appear to any one who\n hears of it to be very magnificent; still, when it is examined into, it will turn out to be economically and carefully managed, and\n in the same manner as the meals of the other Persians who are in office. For\n the king has a thousand victims slain every day: and among them are horses, and\n camels, and oxen, and asses, and stags, and an immense number of sheep; and a\n great many birds too are taken; and the Arabian ostrich (and that is a very\n large animal), and geese, and cocks; and a moderate quantity of them is served\n up to each of the mess-mates of the king, and each of them carries away what is\n left for his breakfast. But the greater part of these victims and of this meat\n is carried out into the court to the spear-bearers and light-armed troops whom\n the king maintains; and in the court the masters of the feasts portion out the\n meat and the bread into equal portions; and as the mercenary troops in Greece\n receive money for their hire, so do these men receive food from the king, on\n account, as if it were money. And in the same way, at the courts of the other\n Persians, who hold office as magistrates, all the food is placed at once upon\n the table; and when the mess-mates of the magistrate have finished their\n supper, then he who superintends the meal distributes what is left on the table\n (and the greater part of the bread and meat is left) to each of the servants.\n And each attendant, when he has received his share, has his food for the day.\n For the most honourable of the mess-mates (their title is \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ) never come to the king except to dinner; because,\n forsooth, they have requested permission not to be bound to come twice in the\n day, in order that they themselves may be able to receive guests at their own\n houses. \n \n ","26":"\n But Herodotus, in his seventh book, says, that the Greeks, who received\n Xerxes in hospitality, and invited him to supper, all came to the very\n extremity of ruin, so as to be utterly turned out of their houses; as for\n instance, among the Thasians, who, because of the cities which they had on the\n continent, received the army of Xerxes and entertained it at supper. Antipater,\n one of these citizens, expended four hundred talents in that single\n entertainment; and he placed on the tables gold and silver cups and goblets;\n and then the soldiers, when they departed after the supper, took them away with\n them. And wherever Xerxes took two meals, dining as well as supping, that city\n was utterly ruined. \n And in the ninth book of his Histories, the same author tells\n us, The king provides a royal entertainment and this is provided once every\n year, on the day on which the king was born. And the name of this feast is in\n Persian \u03c4\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u1f70, but in Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ; and that is the only day tat he has his head\n rubbed, and gives presents to the Persians. \n \n But Alexander the Great, whenever he supped with any of his friends, as Ephippus\n the Olynthian relates in his book on the Deaths of Alexander and Heph\u00e6stion,\n expended each day a hundred min\u00e6, as perhaps sixty or seventy of his friends\n supped with him. But the king of the Persians, as Ctesias and Dinon relate in the\n Histories of Persia, supped with fifteen thousand men, and there were expended on\n the supper four hundred talents; and this amounts in Italian money to twenty four\n hundred thousand of sesterces. And this sum when divided among fifteen thousand\n men is a hundred and sixty sesterces of Italian money for each individual; so that\n it comes to very nearly the same as the expense of Alexander; for he expended a\n hundred min\u00e6, according to the account of Ephippus. \n But Menander, in his play called Drunkenness, estimates the expense of the most\n sumptuous banquet at a talent, saying\u2014 \n Then we do not in these matters act as we should do \n When to the gods we sacrifice; for then we go and buy \n A sheep, an offering for the gods, for scarce ten drachmas' price. \n And then we send for flute players, and ointments, and perfumes, \n And harps, and singing women, eels, and cheese, and honey too; \n And ample jars of Thasian wine; but these can scarcely come, \n When all together reckon'd up, to a small talent's sum. \n And it is as the very extravagance of expense that he has named a talent\n at all. And in his Morose Man he speaks as follows:\u2014 \n See how these housebreakers do sacrifice! \n Bearing such beds and couches, not to please \n The gods, but their own selves. Incense is pious, \n So is the votive cake; and this the god \n Receives well-baked in the holy fire. \n But they when they have offered the chump end \n Of a lean loin, the gall bladder, and bones, \n Not too agreeable or easy to eat, \n Unto the gods, consume the rest themselves. \n \n \n ","27":"\n And Philoxenus of Cythera, in the play which is entitled The Supper, (for he it is\n whom Plato the comic writer mentions in his Phaon, and not\n Philoxenus the Leucadian,) mentions the following as the preparation made for a\n banquet\u2014 \n And then two slaves brought in a well-rubb'd table, \n And then another, and another, till \n The room was fill'd, and then the hanging lamps \n Beam'd bright and shone upon the festive crowns, \n And herbs, and dishes of rich delicacies. \n And then all arts were put in requisition \n To furnish forth a most luxurious meal. \n Barley-cakes white as snow did fill the baskets, \n And then were served up not coarse vulgar pots, \n But well-shaped dishes, whose well-order'd breadth \n Fill'd the rich board, eels, and the well-stuffd conger, \n A dish fit for the gods. Then came a platter \n Of equal size, with dainty sword-fish fraught, \n And then fat cuttle-fish, and the savoury tribes \n Of the long hairy polypus. After this \n Another orb appear'd upon the table, \n Rival of that just brought from off the fire, \n Fragrant with spicy odour. And on that \n Again were famous cuttle-fish, and those \n Fair maids the honey'd squills, and dainty cakes, \n Sweet to the palate, and large buns of wheat, \n Large as a partridge, sweet, and round, which you \n Do know the taste of well. And if you ask \n What more was there, I'd speak of luscious chine, \n And loin of pork, and head of boar, all hot; \n Cutlets of kid, and well-boil'd pettitoes, \n And ribs of beef, and heads, and snouts, and tails. \n Then kid again, and lamb, and hares, and poultry, \n Partridges and the bird from Phasis' stream. \n And golden honey, and clotted cream was there, \n And cheese, which I did join with all in calling \n Most tender fare.

And the walls, \n continues he, were hung with cloths embroidered in gold and purple. And she\n had twelve triclinia laid; and invited Antony to a banquet, and desired him to\n bring with him whatever companions he pleased. And he being astonished at the\n magnificence of the sight, exressed his surprise; and she, smiling, said that\n she made him a present of everything which he saw, and invited him to sup with\n her again the next day, and to bring his friends and captains with him. And\n then she prepared a banquet by far more splendid than the former one, so as to\n make that first one appear contemptible; and again she presented to him\n everything that there was on the table; and she desired each of his captains to\n take for his own the couch on which he lay, and the goblets which were set\n before each couch. And when they were departing she gave to all those of the\n highest rank palanquins, with the slaves for palanquin bearers; and to the rest\n she gave horses, adorned with golden furniture: and to every one she gave\n Aethiopian boys, to bear torches before them. And on the fourth day she paid\n more than a talent for roses; and the floor of the chamber for the men was\n strewed a cubit deep, nets being spread over the blooms. And he relates\n further, that Antony himself, when he was staying at Athens, a short time\n after this, prepared a very superb scaffold to spread over the theatre, covered\n with green wood such as is seen in the caves sacred to Bacchus; and from this\n scaffold he suspended drums and fawn-skins, and all the other toys which one\n names in connexion with Bacchus, and then sat there with his friends, getting\n drunk from daybreak,\u2014a band of musicians, whom he had sent for from Italy,\n playing t him all the time, and all the Greeks around being collected to see\n the sight. And presently, continues he, he crossed over to the\n Acropolis, the whole city of Athens being illuminated with lamps suspended from\n the roof; and after that he ordered himself to be proclaimed as Bacchus\n throughout all the cities in that district. \n \n And Caius the emperor, surnamed Caligula, because he was born in the camp, was not\n only called the young Bacchus, but was also in the habit of going about dressed in\n the entire dress of Bacchus, and he used to sit on the\n tribunal as judge in that dress. \n ","29":"\n Now a man looking at these instances which have occurred in our country before our\n time, may marvel at the poverty of the Greeks, especially if he sets his eyes upon\n the banquets which take place among the Thebans; concerning whom Clitarchus, in\n the first book of his Histories relating to Alexander, speaks, and says that all\n their wealth, when the city was razed to the ground by Alexander, was found to\n amount to four hundred and forty talents, because they were mean spirited and\n gluttons in eating and drinking, preparing in their banquets forced-meat balls,\n and boiled fish and anchovies, and encrasicholi, and sausages, and ribs of beef,\n and soup; on which Attaginus the son of Phrynon feasted Mardonius, with fifty\n other Persians; a man whom Herodotus mentions in his ninth book as having amassed\n an enormous amount of riches.

But Harmodius\n of Lepreum, in the third book of his treatise on the Laws of the People of\n Phigalea, says\u2014 The man among the Phigaleans who is appointed superintendent\n of the food, brought every day three choes of wine, and a medimnus of flour,\n and five mine weight of cheese, and other things suitable for the preparing of\n the victims. And the city provided each of the choruses with three sheep, and a\n cook, and a water-carrier, and tables, and seats for the guests to sit down\n upon, and all other similar appointments; only that the choregus supplied the\n vessels which the cook required. And the banquet was of the following\n description: Cheese, and barley-cake, for the sake of' preserving the laws,\n served up in brazen baskets, which are by some people called mazonoma, having\n derived their name from the use to which they are put; and together with the\n barley-cake and cheese, paunches and salt are given the guests to eat. And when\n they have offered these things to the gods, then they give every one a portion\n of wine to drink in a small mug, made of earthenware: and he who brings the wine says, May you sup well. And the there is put on the\n table for general use some soup and some minced meat; and every one has two\n slices of meat put within his reach. And it was a custom of theirs at all their\n banquets, and most especially at those which were called Mazones, or\n barley-feasts, (for even now the feast in honour of acchus has this name,) to\n give those of the young men who ate most manfully, a larger quantity of broth,\n and also to set before them barley-cakes and loaves, for such an one was\n considered a noble-minded and a valiant man for a large appetite was considered\n an admirable and a famous thing among them. But after supper was over, they\n used to make libations, without having washed their hands, but merely wiping\n hem on pieces of bread; and each of them took away with him that on which he\n had wiped his hands, doing this on account of the nightly objects of fear which\n arise to frighten men in the cross roads: and after the libations a paean is\n sung. But when they sacrifice to the Heroes, a very large sacrifice of oxen\n takes place, and they all feast with the slaves; and the children sit at table\n with their fathers, sitting naked on the stones. \n \n But Theopompus, in the forty-sixth book of his account of the Exploits of Philip,\n says\u2014 The Arcadians in their banquets admit both masters and slaves, and\n prepare but one table for all; and they place the food for all in the middle,\n and they mix the same bowl of wine for the whole company. \n \n ","31":"\n But among the Naucratit\u00e6, according to the account given by Hermeas in the second\n book of his treatis respecting the Grynean Apollo, they sup in the prytaneum on\n the birthday festival of Vesta Prytanitis; and at the Dionysiac festival; and\n again at the assembly of the Com\u00e6an Apollo, \u2014all of them coming in white robes,\n which even t this day they call prytanic garments. And\n when they have sat down to eat, they rise up again on their knees while the herald\n of the sacred festival repeats the national prayers, a making a libation together;\n and, after that, sitting down again, each of them takes two cotyl\u00e6 of wine, except\n the pries of the Pythian Apollo, and of Bacchus, for each of then receives a\n double portion of wine and of all other things; and then a loaf of white bread is\n set before each of them, made very broad, on which another loaf is placed, which\n hey call cribanites. And a joint of pork is placed before hem, and a platter of ptisan or of some vegetable or herb which is in\n season, and a couple of eggs, and a slice of cheese, and some dry figs, and a\n cheesecake, and a garland.

And those who eat in the prytaneum are not\n permitted to take anything away to be eaten; but they only eat what is set before\n them, and give what is left to their slaves. And on all the other days of the year\n it is lawful for any one who pleases of those who are fed at the prytaneum to go\n into the prytaneum to sup, having prepared at his own home some vegetable, or some\n pulse, or some salt meat, or some fish, or a very little bit of pork; and when he\n eats this, he may also have a cotyla of wine.

And as there was a very splendid preparation made, the\n Egyptian laughed at the idea of the Persian living so frugally. But if you\n wish,' said he, ' O king, to know how happy kings ought to feast, permit those\n cooks who formerly belonged to me to prepare for you an Egyptian supper.' And\n when the Persian had ordered that they should do so, when it was prepared,\n Ochus was delighted at the feast, and said, 'May the gods, O Egyptian, destroy\n you miserably for a wicked man, who could leave such a supper as this, and\n desire a much more frugal repast.' But what the Egyptian feasts were\n like Protagorides teaches us in the first book of his treatise on the Daphnic\n Contests, speaking as follows:\u2014 And the third description of suppers is the\n Egyptian, whose tables are not laid at all, but dishes are brought round to the\n guests. \n \n \n ","33":"\n \n But among the Galatians, says Phylarchu in his sixth book,\n it is the custom to place on the tables a great number of loaves broken\n promiscuously, and meat just taken out of the kettles, which no one touches\n without first waiting for the king to see whether he touches anything of what\n is served up before him. But in his third book the same Phylarchus says\n that Ariamnes the Galatian, being an exceedingly rich man, gave notice that\n he would give all the Galaians a banquet every year; and that he did so,\n managing in this manner: He divided the country, measuring it by convenient\n stages along the roads; and at these stages he erected tents of stakes and\n rushes and osiers, each containing about four hundred men, or somewhat more,\n according as the district required, and with reference to the number that might\n be expected to throng in from the villages and towns adjacent to the stage in\n question. And there he placed huge kettles, full of every sort of meat; and he\n had the kettles made in the preceding year before he was to give the feast,\n sending for artizans from other cities. And he caused many victims to be slain,\n \u2014numbers of oxen, and pigs, and sheep, and other animals,\u2014 every day; and he\n caused casks of wine to be prepared, and a great quantity of ground corn. And\n not only, he continues, did all the Galatians who came from the\n villages and cities enjoy themselves, but even all the strangers who happened\n to be passing by were not allowed to escape by the slaves who stood around, but\n were pressed to come in and partake of what had been prepared. \n \n ","34":"\n Xenophon also mentions the Thracian suppers in the seventh book of his Anabasis,\n describing the banquet given by Seuthes in the following words\u2014 But when\n they all came to the supper, and the supper was laid so that they might all sit\n round in a circle, then tripods were brought to all the guests; and they were\n about twenty in number, all full of meat ready carved: and leavened loaves of\n large size were tuck to the joints of meat with skewers. And most especially\n were tables always placed before the guests, for that was the custom. And first\n of all Seuthes behaved in this manner taking the loaves which were near him, he\n broke them into small pieces, and threw the pieces to whoever he chose; and he\n acted in the same way with the meat, leaving before himself only just as much\n as he could eat; and the rest also did the same,\u2014those I\n mean before whom the tables were set. But a certain Arcadian, Arystas by name,\n a terrible fellow to eat, said that throwing the bread and meat about was\n folly; and taking a large loaf in his hand, of the size of three ch\u0153nixes, and\n putting the meat upon his knees, made his supper in that manner. And they\n brought round horns of wine, and all pledged one another; but Arystas, when the\n cup-bearer came to him with the wine, said, as he saw that Xenophon was no\n longer eating any supper, 'Give him the wine, for he has time to drink it, but\n I have not time yet.' And then there arose laughter. And as the liquor went\n round, a Thracian came in, having a white horse, and taking a horn full of\n wine, said, ' O Seuthes, I pledge you, and I make you a present of my horse:\n and if you ride him you will catch whatever you wish to catch; and when you\n retreat you will never need to fear an enemy.' And another man brought in his\n son, and gave him to him in the same manner, pledging him in wine: and another\n gave him garments for his wife. And Timasion, pledging him, gave him a silver\n goblet, and a scimitar worth ten min\u00e6. But Gnesippus, an Athenian, rising up,\n said that there was an ancient and excellent law, that those who had anything\n should give it to the king as a compliment, and that the king should make\n presents to those who had nothing. But Xenophon rose up boldly, and taking the\n horn, said\u2014 'I, O Seuthes, give you myself and these my companions to be\n faithful friends to you; and not one of them is unwilling that I should do so:\n and now they are present here asking for nothing, but being willing to\n encounter labour and danger on your behalf.' And Seuthes, rising up, drank to\n Xenophon, and spilt the rest of the contents of the horn at the same time that\n he did. And after this there came in men who played on horns such as are used\n for giving orders with, and also on trumpets made of raw bull's-hide, in\n excellent tune, as if they had been playing on a magadis. \n \n \n ","35":"\n And Posidonius the Stoic, in the histories which he composed in a manner by no\n means inconsistent with the philosophy which he professed, writing of the laws\n that were established and the customs which prevailed in many\n nations, says\u2014 The Celt\u00e6 place food before their gusts, putting grass for\n their seats, and they serve it up on wooden tables raised a very little above\n the ground: and their food consists of a few loaves, and a good deal of meat\n brought up floating in water, and roasted on the coals or on spits. And they\n eat their meat in a cleanly manner enough, but like lions, taking up whole\n joints in both their hands, and gnawing them; and if there is any part which\n they cannot easily tear away, they cut it off with a small sword which they\n have in a sheath in a private depository. And those who live near the rivers\n eat fish also, and so do those who live near the Mediterranean sea, or near the\n Atlantic ocean; and they eat it roasted with salt and vinegar and cummin seed:\n and cummin seed they also throw into their wine. But they use no oil, on\n account of its scarcity; and because they are not used to it, it seems\n disagreeable to them. But when many of them sup together, they all sit in a\n circle; and the bravest sits in the middle, like the coryph\u00e6us of a chorus;\n because he is superior to the rest either in his military skill, or in birth,\n or in riches: and the man who gives the entertainment sits next to him; and\n then on each side the rest of the guests sit in regular order, according as\n each is eminent or distinguished for anything. And their armour-bearers,\n bearing their large oblong shields, called \u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u1f76, stand behind; and their spear-bearers sit down opposite\n in a circle, and feast in the same manner as their masters. And those who act\n as cup-bearers and bring round the wine, bring it round in jars made either of\n earthenware or of silver, like ordinary casks in shape, and the name they give\n them is \u1f04\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9???\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2. And their platters on which\n they serve up the meat are also made of the same material; but some have brazen\n platters, and some have wooden or plaited baskets. And the liquor which is\n drunk is, among the rich, wine brought from Italy or from the country about\n Marseilles; and this is drunk unmixed, but sometimes a little water is mixed\n with it. But among the poorer classes what is drunk is a beer made of wheat\n prepared with honey, ad oftener still without any honey; and they call it corma. Ad they all drink it out of the same cup, in\n small draughts, not drinking more than a cyathus at a time; but they take\n frequent draughts: and a slave carries the liquor round, beginning at the right hand and going on to the left; and this is the\n way in which they are waited on, and in which they worship the gods, always\n turning towards the right hand. \n \n ","36":"\n And Posidonius continuing, and relating the riches of Lyernius the father of\n Bityis, who was subdued by the Romans, says that he, aiming at becoming a\n leader of the populace, used to drive in a chariot over the plains, and scatter\n gold and silver among the myriads of Celts who followed him; and that he\n enclosed a fenced space of twelve furlongs in length every way, square, in\n which he erected wine-presses, and filled them with expensive liquors; and that\n he prepared so vast a quantity of eatables that for very many days any one who\n chose was at liberty to go and enjoy what was there prepared, being waited on\n without interruption or cessation. And once, when he had issued beforehand\n invitations to a banquet, some poet from some barbarian tribe came too late and\n met him on the way, and sung a hymn in which he extolled his magnificence, and\n bewailed his own misfortune in having come too late: and Lyernius was pleased\n with his ode, and called for a bag of gold, and threw it to him as he was\n running by the side of his chariot; and that he picked it up, and then went on\n singing, saying that his very footprints upon the earth over which he drove\n produced benefits to men. These now are the accounts of the Celt\u00e6 given\n by Posidonius in the third and in the twentieth books of his History. \n ","37":"\n But in the fifth book, speaking of the Parthians, he says \u2014 But a friend who\n is invited does not share the same table, but sitting on the ground while the\n king reclines near on a lofty couch, eats whatever is thrown to him from the\n king, like a dog. And very often he is torn away from his feast on the ground\n for some trifling cause, and is scourged with rods and knotted whips; and when\n he is all covered with blood he falls down on his face on the floor, and adores\n the man who has punished him as his benefactor. \n \n And in his eleventh book, speaking of Seleucus the king, and relating how he came\n against Media, and warred against Arsaces, and was taken prisoner by the\n barbarian, and how he remained a long time in captivity to Arsaces, being treated\n like a king by him, he writes thus\u2014 Among the Parthians, at their banquets,\n the king had a couch on which he reclined by himself\n higher than all the rest, and apart from them; and a table also was laid for\n him by himself, as for a hero, laden with all sorts of barbaric\n delicacies. And when he is speaking of Heracleon the Ber$oan, who was\n promoted to honour by that king Antiochus who was surnamed Grypus, and who very\n nearly turned his benefactor out of his kingdom, he writes as follows in the\n fourth book of his Histories: He also gave entertainments to the soldiers,\n making them sit down on the ground in the open air by thousands: and the\n entertainment consisted of large loaves and meat; and their drink was any sort\n of wine that could be got, mingled with cold water. And they were waited on by\n men girded with swords, and there was an orderly silence throughout the whole\n company. \n \n Again, in his second book, he says\u2014 In the city of the Romans when they\n feast in the temple of Hercules, when a general who is celebrating a triumph\n furnishes the entertainment, the whole preparation of the banquet is of a\n Herculean character; for honey-wine is served out to the guests as wine, and\n the food consists of huge loaves, and smoked meat boiled, and also great\n abundance of roast meat from the victims which have been lately slain. But\n among the Etruscans luxurious tables are spread twice a-day; and couches\n embroidered with flowers, and silver drinking cups of every sort. And a great\n number of well-appointed slaves is at hand, dressed in expensive\n garments. And Tim\u00e6us, in the first book of his Histories, says that all\n the female servants in that nation always wait at table naked till they are quite\n grown up. \n ","38":"\n And Megasthenes, in the second book of his Indian History, says\u2014 Among the\n Indians at a banquet a table is set before each individual; and it is like a\n sideboard or beaufet; and on the table is placed a golden dish, in which they\n throw first of all boiled rice, just as if a person were going to boil groats,\n and then they add many sorts of meat dressed after the Indian fashion. \n \n But the Germans, as Posidonius relates in his thirtieth book, eat for dinner meat\n roasted in separate joins; and they drink milk and unmixed wine. And some of the\n tribes of the Campanians practise single combat at their drinking parties. But\n Nicolaus of Damascus, one of the philosophers of the \n Peripatetic school, in the hundred-and-tenth book of his His- tory, relates that\n the Romans at their feasts practise single combats, writing as follows\u2014 The\n Romans used to exhibit spectacles of single combats, not only in their public\n shows and in their theatres, having derived the custom from the Etruscans, but\n they did so also at their banquets. Accordingly, people often invited their\n friends to an entertainment, promising them, in addition to other things, that\n they should see two or three pairs of single combatants. And when they had had\n enough of meat and drink, they then called in the combatants: and as soon as\n one of them was killed, the guests clapped, being delighted at the exhibition.\n And in one instance a man left it in his will that some beautiful women, whom\n he had purchased as slaves, should engage in single combat: and in another case\n a man desired that some youthful boys whom he had loved should do so; but the\n people would not tolerate such notorious proceedings, and declared the will\n invalid. And Eratosthenes says, in the first book of his Catalogue of\n the Victors at Olympia, that the Etruscans used to box to the music of the\n flute. \n ","39":"\n But Posidonius, in the third, and also in the twentieth book of his Histories,\n says\u2014 The Celt\u00e6 sometimes have single combats at their entertainments.\n For being collected in arms, they go through the exercise, and make feints at,\n and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another. And being irritated\n by this, if the bystanders do not stop them, they will proceed even to kill one\n another. But in olden times, he continues, there was a custom\n that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table, and the bravest man took it;\n and if any one else laid claim to it, then the two rose up to fight till one of\n them was slain. And other men in the theatre having received some silver or\n gold money, and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine, having\n taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given, and having\n distributed them among their nearest connexions, have laid themselves down on\n doors with their faces upwards, and then allowed some bystander to cut their\n throats with a sword. \n \n And Euphorion the Chalcidian, in his Historical Memorials, writes as\n follows\u2014 But among the Romans it is common for five mine to be offered to\n any one who chooses to take it, to allow his head to be\n cut off with an axe, so that his heirs might receive the reward: and very often\n many have returned their names as willing, so that there has been a regular\n contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to\n death. \n \n ","40":"\n And Hermippus, in the first book of his treatise on Lawgivers, asserts that the\n Mantineans were the original inventors of men to fight in single combat, and that\n Demonax, one of their citizens, was the original suggestor of such a course; and\n that the Cyreneans were the next to follow their example. And Ephorus, in the\n sixth book of his History, says \u2014\"The Mantineans and Arcadians were in the habit\n of practising warlike exercises; and even to this day they call the military dress\n and the ancient fashion of arming the Mantinean, as having been invented by that\n people. And in addition to this, the exercises of single combat were first\n invented in Mantinea, Demeas being the original author of the invention. And that\n the custom of single combatants was an ancient one, Aristophanes shows, when he\n speaks thus in his Ph\u0153nisse\u2014 \n And on the heroes twain, the sons of \u0152dipus, \n Has savage Mars descended; and they now \n Seek the arena dread of single combat. \n And the word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 appears not to be\n derived from the noun \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7, but rather from the\n verb \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9. For as often as a word compounded\n of \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7 ends in \u03bf\u03c2, as in the words \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2,\n \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, and the \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 race of Perseus, spoken of by Pindar, then it is acuted on\n the antepenultima; but when it has the acute accent on the penultima, then the\n verb \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 comes in; as is shown in the words\n \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ; in the expression \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, in Stesichorus; and the noun\n \u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. But\n Posidippus the comic writer, in his Pornoboscus, says\u2014 \n The man who never went to sea has never shipwreck 'd been, \n But we have been more miserable than \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (gladiators in single combat). \n And that even men of reputation and captains fought in single combat, and\n did so in accordance with premeditated challenges, we have already said in other\n parts of this discussion. And Diyllus the Athenian says, in the ninth book of his Histories, that Cassander, when returning from B\u0153otia,\n after he had buried the king and queen at Aeg\u00e6, and with them Cynna the mother of\n Eurydice, and had paid them all the other honours to which they were entitled,\n celebrated also a show of single combats, and four of the soldiers entered the\n arena on that occasion. \n ","41":"\n But Demetrius the Scepsian, in the twelfth book of Trojan Array, says, that\n at the court of Antiochus the king, who was surnamed the Great, not only did\n the friends of the king dance in arms at his entertainments, but even the king\n himself did so. And when the turn to dance came to Hegesianax the Alexandrian\n from the Troas, who wrote the Histories, he rose up and said\u2014' Do you wish, O\n king, to see me dance badly, or would you prefer hearing me recite my own poems\n very well?' Accordingly, being ordered rather to recite his poems, he sang the\n praises of the king in such a manner, that he was thought worthy of payment,\n and of being ranked as one of the king's friends for the time to come. But\n Duris the Samian, in the seventeenth book of his Histories, says that\n Polysperchon, though a very old man, danced whenever he was drunk,\u2014a man who\n was inferior to no one of the Macedonians, either as a commander or in respect\n of his general reputation: but still that he put on a saffron robe and\n Sicyonian sandals, and kept on dancing a long time. But Agatharchides\n the Cnidian, in the eighth book of his History of Asia, relates that the friends\n of Alexander the son of Philip once gave an entertainment to the king, and gilded\n all the sweetmeats which were to be served up in the second course. And when they\n wanted to eat any of them, they took off the gold and threw that away with all the\n rest which was not good to eat, in order that their friends might be spectators of\n their sumptuousness, and their servants might become masters of the gold. But they\n forget that, as Duris also relates, Philip the father of Alexander, when he had a\n golden cup which was fifty drachmas in weight, always took it to bed with him, and\n always slept with it at his head. And Seleucus says, that some of the\n Thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging; and fix a round\n noose to some high place, exactly beneath which they place a stone which is\n easily turned round when any one stands upon it; and then they cast lots, and\n he who draws the lot, holding a sickle in his hand, stands\n upon the stone, and puts his neck into the halter; and then another person\n comes and raises the stone, and the man who is suspended, when the stone moves\n from under him, if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle,\n is killed; and the rest laugh, thinking his death good sport. \n \n ","42":"\n This is what I had to say, my friends and messmates, O men far the first of all\n the Greeks, being what I know concerning the banquets of the ancients. But Plato\n the philosopher, in the first book of his treatise on the Laws of Banquets, speaks\n in this manner, describing the whole matter with the greatest accuracy\u2014 And\n you would never see any where in the country or in the cities which are under\n the dominion of Laced\u00e6mon, any drinking parties, nor any of their\n accompaniments, which are calculated to excite as much pleasure as possible.\n Nor is there any one who would not at once impose as heavy a fine as possible\n on any one whom he met carrying his revely to the degree of drunkenness; and he\n would not even excuse him if he had the pretext of the Dionysiac festival of\n Bacchus. As I have known to be the case among you, in the case of men carried\n in carriages, and at Tarentum among our own colonists, where I have seen the\n whole city drunk at the time of the Dionysiac festival. But at Laced\u00e6mon\n nothing of the sort ever takes place. \n \n ","43":"\n And Cynulcus said on this,\u2014I only wish that you had played at that Thracian game\n and been hanged yourself. For you have kept us in suspense till we are almost\n famished, as if we were waiting for the rising star, till which arises, those who\n have invented this beautiful philosophy say that it is unlawful to taste of any\n food at all. But I, wretched man that I am, according, to the words of Diphilus\n the coming poet\u2014 \n Am almost become a mullet from the extremity of hunger. \n And you yourselves also have forgotten those admirable verses of the\n poet, who said\u2014 \n For it is not a bad thing to eat supper at a proper season. \n And the admirable Aristophanes has said in his Cocalus\u2014 \n But it is now, O father, altogether noon, \n When it is right for the young men to sup. \n \n But for me it would be much better to sup as the men are\n represented as supping in the banquet given by Parmeniscus the Cynic,\u2014than to come\n hither and see everything carried round us as if we all had fevers. And when we\n laughed at this, one of us said,\u2014-But my most excellent fellow, do not grudge\n giving us the account of that Parmeniscean banquet. And he, raising himself up,\n said\u2014 \n I swear to you most solemnly, my friends, \n according to the words of the sweet Antiphanes, who, in the Woman given\n in Marriage, said\u2014 \n I swear to you, O men, by the god himself, \n From whom the joys of drunkenness and wine \n Do come to mortal men, that I prefer \n This happy life which here is mine at present, \n To all the splendid pomp of king Seleucus. \n 'Tis sweet to eat e'en lentils without fear, \n But sad to sleep on down in daily terror. \n \n \n ","44":"\n But Parmeniscus began in this manner\u2014\"Parmeniscus to Molpis, greeting,\u2014As I have\n often in my conversations with you talked about illustrious invitations and\n entertainments, I am afraid lest you should labour under such a plethora as to\n blame me; on which account I wish to make you a partaker in the feast which was\n given by Cebes of Cyzicus. Therefore, having first taken a drink of hyssop, come\n at the proper hour to the feast. For at the time when the festival of Bacchus was\n being celebrated at Athens, I went to sup with him; and I found six Cynics sitting\n at table, and one dogleader, Carneus the Megarian. But, as the supper was delayed,\n a discussion arose, what water is the sweetest. And while some were praising the\n water of Lerna, and some that of Pirene, Carneus, imitating Philoxenus, said\u2014That\n is the best water which is poured over our hands. So then when the tables were\n laid we went to supper, \n And much pulse porridge then we ate, but more did still flow in. \n Then again lentils were brought on the table steeped in vinegar; and that\n child of Jupiter laid his hands on them and said\u2014 \n Jove, may the man who made these lentils grow, \n Never escape thy notice or thy memory. \n And then some one else immediately cried out\u2014 \n May a lentil deity and a lentil fate seize you. \n \n But to me may there be, according to the words of the comic\n poet Diphilus, which he uses in his Peliades\u2014 \n \n A. A flowery supper very sumptuous, \n A bowl quite lull of pulse for every man. \n \n B. That first part is not flowery. \n \n A. After that \n Let a saperdes dance into the middle, \n A little strong to smell. \n \n B. That is a flower \n Which soon will drive the thrushes all away. \n And as a great laugh arose, immediately that spoon of the theatre Melissa\n came in, and that dogfly Nicium, each of them being a courtesan of no small\n renown: and so they, looking on what was set upon the table and admiring it,\n laughed. And Nicium said,\u2014Is not there one of all you men so proud of your beards\n that eats fish? Is it because your ancestor Meleager the Gadarean, in his poem\n entitled the Graces, said that Homer, being a Syrian by birth, represented the\n ancients as abstaining from fish in accordance with the custom of his own country,\n although there was a great abundance of them in the Hellespont? Or have you ever\n read that one treatise of his which embraces a comparison between peas and\n lentilsfor I see that you have made a great preparation of lentils. And when I see\n it, I should advise you, according to the rules of Antisthenes the pupil of\n Socrates, to relieve yourselves of life if you stick to such food as this. And\n Carneus replied to her\u2014Euxitheus the Pythagorean, O Nicium, as Clearchus the\n Peripatetic tells us, in the second book of his Lives, said that the souls of all\n men were bound in the body, and in the life which is on earth, for the sake of\n punishment; and that God has issued an edict that if they do not remain there\n until he voluntarily releases them himself, they shall fall into more numerous and\n more important calamities. On which account all me, being afraid of those\n threatenings of the gods, fear to depart from life by their own act, but only\n gladly welcome death when he comes in old age, trusting that that deliverance of\n the soul then takes place with the full consent of those who have the power to\n sanction it. And this doctrine we ourselves believe. But I have no objection,\n replied she, to your selecting one of three evils, if you please. For do you not\n know, O retched men, that these heavy kinds of food shut in the dominant principle of the soul, and do not allow wisdom to exist\n unimpaired in it? \n ","45":"\n Accordingly Theopompus, in the fifth book of his History of the Actions of Philip,\n says\u2014 For to eat much, and to eat meat, takes away the reasoning powers,\n and makes the intel- lect slower, and fills a man with anger, and harshness,\n and all sorts of folly. And the admirable Xenophon says, that it is\n sweet to a hungry man to eat barley-cakes and cardamums, and sweet to a thirsty\n man to draw water out of the river and drink it. But Socrates was often caught\n walking in the depth of evening up and down before his house; and to those who\n asked him what he was doing there, he used to reply that he was getting a relish\n for supper. But we shall be satisfied with whatever portion we receive from you,\n and we are not angry as if we received less than we ought, like the Hercules in\n Anticlides. For he says, in the second book of his Returns\u2014 After Hercules\n had accomplished his labours, when Eurystheus was solemnizing some sacrificial\n feast, he also was invited. And when the sons of Eurystheus were setting before\n each one of the company his proper portion, but placing a meaner one before\n Hercules, Hercules, thinking that he was being treated with indignity, slew\n three of the sons, Perimedes, Eurybius, and Eurypylus. But we are not\n so irascible, even though in all other points we are imitators of Hercules. \n ","46":"\n \n \n For lentils are a tragic food, \n said Archagathus . . . . to have written; which also \n Orestes ate when he had recover'd from his sickness, \n as Sophilus the comic writer says. But it is a Stoic doctrine, that the\n wise man will do everything well, and will be able to cook even lentils cleverly.\n On which account Timon the Phliasian said\u2014 \n And a man who knows not how to cook a lentil wisely. \n As if a lentil could not be boiled in any other way except ac- cording to\n the precepts of Zeno, who said\u2014 \n Add to the lentils a twelfth part of coriander. \n And Crates the Theban said\u2014 \n Do not prefer a dainty dish to lentils, \n And so cause factious quarrels in our party.' \n \n And Chrysippus, in his treatise on the Beautiful, quoting\n some apophthegms to us, says\u2014 \n Eat not an olive when you have a nettle; \n But take in winter lentil-macaroni\u2014 \n Bah! bah! \n Lentil-macaroni's like ambrosia in cold weather. \n And the witty Aristophanes said, in his Gerytades\u2014 \n You're teaching him to boil porridge or lentils. \n And, in his Amphiaraus\u2014 \n You who revile the lentil, best of food. \n And Epicharmus says, in his Dionysi\u2014 \n And then a dish of lentils was boil'd up. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Women like one another\u2014 \n Things go on well. Do you now boil some lentils, \n Or else at least now teach me who you are. \n And I know that a sister of Ulysses, the most prudent and wisest of men,\n was called \u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u1fc6 (lentil), the same whom some other\n writers call Callisto, as Mnaseas of Patra relates, in the third book of his\n History of the Affairs of Europe, and as Lysimachus also tells us, in the third\n book of his Returns. \n ","47":"\n And when Plutarch had burst into a violent fit of laughter at this, the Cynic, who\n could not endure to have his extensive learning on the subject of lentils\n disregarded, said\u2014 \"But all you fine gentlemen from Alexandria, O Plutarch, are\n fed from your childhood on lentils; and your whole city is full of things made of\n lentils: which are mentioned by Sopater the lentil parodist, in his drama entitled\n Bacchis, where he speaks as follows:\u2014 \n I could not bear to eat a common loaf, \n Seeing a large high brazen pile of lentils. \n For, what is there of which mortals have need, (according to your own\n idol, Euripides, O you most learned of men,) except two things only, \n The corn of Ceres and a draught of water? \n And they are here, and able to support us. \n But we are not with plenty such as this \n Contented, but are slaves to luxury \n And such contrivances of other food. \n And in another place that dramatic philosopher says\u2014 \n The moderate fare shall me content \n Of a plain modest table; \n And I will never seek nor e'en admit \n Whatever is out of season and superfluous. \n \n And Socrates said that he differed from other men in this,\n that they lived that they might eat, but he ate that he might live. And Diogenes\n said to those who accused him of scratching himself,\u2014I wish I could scratch my\n stomach, so as to rub all poverty and want out of it. And Euripides, in his\n Suppliant Women, says of Capaneus\u2014 \n This man is Capancus, a man who had \n Abundant riches, but no pride therefrom \n Lodged in his, more than in a poor man's bosom. \n But those who boasted of their luxury \n He blamed, and praised the contented spirit. \n For virtue did not, as he said, consist \n In eating richly, but in moderation. \n \n \n ","48":"\n Capaneus was not, as it seems, such as the honest Chrysippus describes, in his\n treatise On those things which are not eligible for their own sakes. For he speaks\n in this manner: \u2014 Some men apply themselves with such eagerness to the\n pursuit of money, that it is even related, that a man once, when near his end,\n swallowed a number of pieces of gold, and so died. Another person sewed a\n quantity of money into a tunic, and put it on, and then ordered his servants to\n bury him in that dress, neither burning his body, nor stripping it and laying\n it out. For these men and all like them may almost be said, as they\n die, to cry out\u2014 \n Oh gold, the choicest of all gifts to men! \n For no fond mother does such raptures know, \n Nor children in the house, nor any father, \n Such as do flow from you, and are enjoy'd \n By those who own you. If like yours the face \n Of Venus, when she rose up from the sea, \n No wonder that she has ten thousand lovers. \n Such great thirst for money was there among the men of that time,\n concerning which Anacharsis, when some one asked him what the Greeks used money\n for? said, To count with. But Diogenes, in his treatise on Polity, proposed to\n establish a law that bits of bone should be taken as coins; and well too has\n Euripides said\u2014 \n Speak not of wealth; that god I worship not, \n Who comes with ease into a bad man's power. \n And Chrysippus, in his elementary work, which is entitled, A Treatise on\n Good and Evil Things, says that \"a certain young man from Ionia came to sojourn at\n Athens, clothed in a purple robe having golden fringes; and when some one asked of him what countryman he was, he replied that he was\n rich. And, perhaps, it may be the very same person whom Alexis mentions in his\n Thebans, where he says\u2014 \n \n A. But from what country does this person come? \n \n B. From Richland; and by general consent \n The natives of that land are counted noble; \n Nor can one find a noble beggar anywhere. \n \n \n ","49":"\n When Cynulcus had said this, and when no one applauded him, he got out of temper;\n and said,\u2014But since these men, O you master of the feast, are made so\n uncomfortable by a Diarrh\u0153a of words as to feel no hunger; or perhaps, it may be\n that they laugh at what is said about lentils, (having in their mind what is said\n by Pherecrates, in his Coriander\u2014 \n \n A. Come now, I'll sit me down; and bring me\n here, \n O slave, a table, and a cup of wine, \n That I may eat to flavour what I drink. \n \n B. Here is a cup, a table, and some lentils. \n \n A. No lentils bring to me, I like them not: \n For if one eats them, they do taint the breath.)\u2014 \n Since then, on this account, these wise men guard against the lentils, at\n all events cause some bread to be given to us, with a little plain food; no\n expensive dishes, but any of those vulgar lentils, if you have them, or what is\n called lentil soup. And when every one laughed, especially at the idea of the\n lentil soup, he said, You are very ignorant men, you feasters, never having read\n any books, which are the only things to instruct those who desire what is good. I\n mean the books of the Silli of Timon the Pyrrhonian. For he it is who speaks of\n lentil soup, in the second book of his Silli, writing as follows:\u2014 \n The Teian barley-cakes do please me not, \n Nor e'en the Lydian sauces: but the Greeks, \n And their dry lentil soup, delight me more \n Than all that painful luxury of excess. \n For though the barley-cakes of Teos are preeminently good, (as also are\n those from Eretria, as Sopater says, in his Suitors of Bacchis, where he says\u2014\n \n We came to Eretria, for its white meal famed;) \n and also, the Lydian sauces; still Timon prefers the lentil soup to both\n of them put together. \n ","50":"\n To this our admirable entertainer, Laurentius himself, replied, saying,\u2014O you men\n who drive the dogs, according to the Jocasta of Strattis, the\n comic poet, who in the play entitled The Ph\u0153nician Women, is represented as\n saying\u2014 \n I wish to give you both some good advice: \n When you boil lentils, pour no perfume o'er them. \n And Sopater, too, whom you were mentioning just now, in his Descent to\n Hell, speaks in these terms:\u2014 \n Ulysses, king of Ithaca\u2014'Tis perfume \n On lentils thrown: courage, my noble soul! \n And Clearchus the Peripatetic philosopher, in his treatise on Proverbs,\n gives the saying, Perfume thrown on lentils; as a proverb which my\n grandfather Varro also mentions, he, I mean, who was nicknamed Menippius. And many\n of the Roman grammarians, who have not had much intercourse with many Greek poets\n or historians, do not know where it is that Varro got his Iambic from. But you\n seem to me, O Cynulcus, (for you delight in that name, not using the name by which\n your mother has called you from your birth,) according to your friend Timon, to be\n a noble and great man, not knowing that the lentil soup obtained mention from the\n the former Epicharmus, in his Festival, and in his Islands, and also from\n Antiphanes the comic poet; who, using the diminutive form, has spoken of it in his\n Wedding, under the following form of expression\u2014 \n A little lentil soup ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ), a slice of\n sausage. \n And Magnus immediately taking up the conversation, said,\u2014 The most\n universally excellent Laurentius has well and cleverly met this hungry dog on the\n subject of the lentil soup. But I, like to the Galatians of the Paphian Sopater,\n among whom it is a custom whenever they have met with any eminent success in war\n to sacrifice their prisoners to the gods,\u2014 \n I too, in imitation of those men, \n Have vow'd a fiery sacrifice to the gods\u2014 \n Three of these secretly enroll'd logicians. \n And now that I have heard your company \n Philosophise and argue subtlely, \n Persisting firmly, I will bring a test, \n A certain proof of all your arguments: \n First smoking you. And if then any one \n When roasted shrinks and draws away his leg, \n He shall be sold to Zeno for his master \n For transportation, as bereft of wisdom. \n \n \n ","51":"\n For I will speak freely to them. If you are so fond of \n contentment, O philosopher, why do you not admire those dis- ciples of Pythagoras,\n concerning whom Antiphanes says, in his Monuments\u2014 \n Some miserable Pythagoreans came \n Gnawing some salt food in a deep ravine, \n And picking up such refuse in a wallet. \n And in the play which is especially entitled the Wallet, he says\u2014 \n First, like a pupil of Pythagoras, \n He eats no living thing, but peels some husks \n Of barley which he's bought for half an obol, \n Discolour'd dirty husks, and those he eats. \n And Alexis says, in his Tarentines\u2014 \n For, as we hear, the pupils of Pythagoras \n Eat no good meat nor any living thing, \n And they alone of men do drink no wine. \n But Epicharides will bitches eat; \n The only one of all the sect; but then \n He kills them first, and says they are not living. \n And proceeding a little further, he says\u2014 \n \n A. Shreds of Pythagoras and subtleties \n And well-fill'd thoughts are their sufficient food. \n Their daily meals are these-a simple loaf \n To every man, and a pure cup of water. \n And this is all. \n \n B. You speak of prison fare. \n \n A. This is the way that all the wise men live. \n These are the hardships that they all endure. \n \n B. Where do they live in such a way? \n \n A. Yet they procure \n Dainties after their sort for one another; \n Know you not Melanippides and Phaon, \n Phyromachus and Phanus are companions? \n And they together sup on each fifth day \n On one full cotyla of wheaten meal. \n And, in his Female Pythagorean, he says\u2014 \n \n A. The banquet shall be figs and grapes and\n cheese, \n For these the victims are which the strict law \n Allows Pythagoras' sect to sacrifice. \n \n B. By Jove, as fine a sacrifice as possible. \n And a few lines afterwards, he says\u2014 \n One must for a short time, my friend, endure \n Hunger, and dirt, and cold, and speechlessness, \n And sullen frowns, and an unwashen face. \n \n \n ","52":"\n But you, my philosophical friends, practise none of these things. But what is far\n worse than any of them, you talk about what you do not in the\n least understand; and, as if you were eating in an orderly manner, you take in\n mouthfuls like the man in that sweet poet Antiphanes; for he says, in his Runaway\n Slave-catcher\u2014 Taking a moderate mouthful, small outside, But large within his\n hand, as women do. And in the same way you eat a great deal and eat very fast;\n when it is in your power, according to the words of the same poet which he uses in\n the Thombycius, to buy for a single drachma food well suited to you, such\n as garlic, cheese, onions, and capers; for all these only cost a\n drachma. And Aristophanes says, in his Pythagoreans\u2014 \n What? do we think, I ask you in God's name, \n That these philosophers of olden time, \n The pupils of Pythagoras, went thus \n In dirt and rags all of their own accord? \n I don't believe one word of such a thing. \n No; they were forced to do so, as they had not \n A single farthing to buy clothes or soap. \n And then they made a merit of economy, \n And laid down rules, most splendid rules for beggars. \n But only put before them fish or meat; \n And if they do not their own fingers bite \n For very eagerness, I will be bound \n To let you hang me ten times over. \n And it is not foreign to the present discussion to mention an epigram\n which was made with reference to you, which Hegesander the Delphian has quoted, in\n the sixth book of his Commentaries\u2014 \n Men drawing up your eyebrows, and depressing \n Your scornful nostrils till they reach the chin, \n Wearing your beards in sacks, strippers of dishes, \n Wearing your cloak outside, with unshod feet \n Looking like oil, and eating stealthily \n Like hungry vagrants 'neath night's friendly cover, \n Cheaters of youth, spouters of syllables, \n Pretenders to vain wisdom, but pretending \n To make your only object Virtue's self. \n \n \n ","53":"\n But Archestratus of Gela, in his treatise on Gastronomy, (which is the only\n poetical composition which you wise men admire; following Pythagoras in this\n doctrine alone, namely silence, and doing this only because of your want of words;\n and besides that, you profess to think well of the Art of Love of Sphodrias the\n Cynic, and the Amatory Conversation of Protagorides, and the Convivial Dialogues\n of that beautiful philosopher Pers\u00e6us, compiled out of the\n Commentaries of Stilpon and Zeno, in which he inquires, How one may guard against\n guests at a banquet going to sleep; and, How one ought to use drinking of healths;\n and, When one ought to introduce beautiful boys and girls into a banquet; and when\n one ought to treat them well as if they were admired, and when one ought to send\n them away as disregarding them; and also, concerning various kinds of cookery, and\n concerning loaves, and other things; and all the over-subtle discussions in which\n the son of Sophroniscus has indulged concerning kissing. A philosopher who was\n continually exercising his intellect on such investigations as these, being\n entrusted, as Hermippus relates, with the citadel of Corinth by Antigonus, got\n drunk and lost even Corinth itself, being outwitted and defeated by Aratus the\n Sicyonian; who formerly had argued in his Dialogues against Zeno the philosopher,\n contending that a wise man would in every respect be a good general; and this\n excellent pupil of Zeno proved this especial point admirably by his own\n achievements. For it was a witty saying of Bion the Borysthenite, when he saw a\n brazen statue of his, on which was the inscription, PERSEUS OF CITIUM, THE PUPIL\n OF ZENO, that the man who engraved the inscription had made a blunder, for that it\n ought to have been, Pers\u00e6us the servant ( \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b5\u03b1 \n not \u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b5\u03b1 ) of Zeno; for he had been born a slave\n of Zeno, as Nicias of Nic\u00e6a relates, in his History of Philosophers; and this is\n confirmed by Sotion the Alexandrian, in his Successions. And I have met with two\n books of that admirable work of Pers\u00e6us, which have this title, Convivial\n Dialogues. \n \n ","54":"\n But Ctesibius the Chalcidian, the friend of Menedemus, as Antigonus the Carystian\n relates in his Lives, being asked by somebody, What he had ever got by philosophy?\n replied, The power of getting a supper without contributing to it himself. On\n which account Timon somewhere or other said to him\u2014 \n Oh you mad dinner hunter, with the eyes \n Of a dead corpse, and heart both bold and shameless \n And Ctesibius was a man who made very good guesses, and was a very witty\n man, and a sayer of amusing things; on which account every one used to invite him\n to their parties; he was not a man like you, you Cynic, who never sacrificed to\n the Graces, nor even to the Muses. And therefore Virtue \n avoiding you, and all like you, sits by Pleasure, as Mnasalces the Sicyonian says,\n in his Epigrams\u2014 \n Here I most miserable Virtue sit \n By Pleasure's side, and cut my hair for grief, \n Crnsh'd in my spirit; for profane Delight \n Is judged by all my better, and my chief. \n And Baton the comic writer says in his Homicide\u2014 \n Now I invite those moderate philosophers, \n Who ne'er allow themselves a single pleasure, \n Who keep on looking for the one wise man \n In all their walks and conversations, \n As if he were a slave who'd run away. \n O wretched man, why, when you have a ticket, \n Will you refuse to drink? Why dost thou now \n Do so much wrong to the Gods? why dost thou make \n Money of greater value than the rate \n Which nature puts on it? You drink but water, \n And so must be a worthless citizen; \n For so you cheat the farmer and the merchant; \n But I by getting drunk increase their trade. \n Then you at early dawn bear round a cruet, \n Seeking for oil, so that a man must think \n You have an hour-glass with you, not a bottle.) \n \n \n ","55":"\n However, Archestratus, as I was saying before this long digression, whom you\n praise as equal to Homer, because of his praises of the stomach\u2014though your friend\n Timon says of the stomach, \n Than which no part more shameless can be found\u2014 \n when speaking of the Sea-dog, writes as follows:\u2014 \n There are but few so happy as to know \n This godlike food, nor do men covet it \n Who have the silly souls of common mortals. \n They fear because it is an animal \n Which living preys on man. But every fish \n Loves human flesh, if it can meet with it. \n So that 'tis fit that all who talk such nonsense \n Should be confined to herbs, and should be sent \n To Diodorus the philosopher \n And starve, and so pythagorize with him. \n But this Diodorus was by birth an Aspendian; but desiring to be thought a\n Pythagorean, he lived after the fashion of you Cynics, letting his hair grow,\n being dirty, and going barefoot. On which account some people fancied that it was\n an article of the Pythagorean creed to let the hair grow, which was in reality a\n fashion introduced by Diodorus, as Hermippus asserts. But\n Tim\u00e6us of Tauromenium, in the ninth book of his Histories, writes thus concerning\n him- \"Diodorus, who was by birth an Aspendian, introduced a novel fashion of\n dress, and pretended to resemble the Pythagoreans. Stratonicus wrote and sent a\n messenger to him, desiring him who carried the message to seek out a disciple of\n Pythagoras who kept the portico crowded by his insane vagaries about dress, and\n his insolence. And Sosicrates, in the third book of the Succession of\n Philosophers, relates that Diodorus used to wear a long beard, and a worn-out\n cloak, and to keep his hair long, indulging in these fashions out of a vain\n ostentation. For that the Pythagoreans before him wore very handsome clothes, and\n used baths, and perfumes, and hair of the ordinary length. \n ","56":"\n And if you in reality, O philosopher, do admire contentment and moderation in your\n feasts, why is it that you have come hither without being invited? Did you come as\n to a house of intemperance, in order to learn to make a Catalogue of a cook's\n instruments? or in order to spout some verses of Cepholion the Athenian? For\n according to the Cedalion of Sophocles, you are \n A branded lot, all knaves and parasites. \n And he says that you philosophers always have your minds set upon\n banquets; and that you think it constantly necessary to ask for something to eat\n or to devour some Cynic food. For there is no need for our picking our phrases.\n And all this is plain from what Alexis relates in this book which is entitled\n Linus: and in that he supposes Hercules to have been educated by Linus, and to\n have been ordered by him to select any one out of a number of books that were at\n hand to read. And he having taken a cookery-book in his hand, retained it with\n great eagerness. And Linus then speaks to him in the following terms\u2014 \n \n Lin. Come here, and take whatever book you\n please, \n And read it carefully, when you have scann'd \n The titles, and the subjects well consider'd. \n There's Orpheus here, and Hesiod, and plays, \n Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus too, \n All sorts of works. For thus your choice will show me \n Your nature, and your favourite pursuit. \n \n Her. I will take this. \n \n Lin. First show me what it is. \n \n Her. A cookery book, as says the title-page. \n \n \n Lin. You're a philosopher, that's very plain, \n Who passing over all these useful books, \n Choose out the art of Simus. \n \n Her. Who is Simus \n \n Lin. A very clever man; now he has turn'd \n To tragic studies; and of all the actors \n Is, the most skilful cook, as those who eat \n His dishes do declare. And of all cooks \n By far the cleverest actor. \n \n Her. He's a man \n Of noble appetite; say what you wish; \n For be of this assured, that I am hungry. \n \n \n ","57":"\n When Magnus had run through these quotations, Cynulcus, looking at the\n philosophers who were present, said\u2014 \n Have you seen the Thasian brine, and heard how he does bark? \n How speedily the fellow did revenge himself, and thoroughly; \n It does not seem a case of one blind speaking to a deaf man: \n as Cratinus says, in his Archilochi. For he, forgetting before what a\n tribunal he was making an exhibition of his fine iambics, read his colabri with\n his natural greediness, and at the same time with his usual elegance of\n expression, and \n Melodies out of time, and tuneless cymbals: \n and after all this fine ignorant stupidity, he goes round to people's\n houses, seeking out where any handsome banquet is prepared, carrying his conduct\n to a length even beyond the Athenian Ch\u00e6rephon, of whom Alexis says in his\n Fugitive\u2014 \n That Ch\u00e6rephon has always got some trick, \n And now he's looking for some feast to share \n Where he himself will not be call'd upon \n For any contribution. For wheresoever \n A pot, such as is let to cooks, does stand, \n Thither he goeth at the earliest dawn; \n And if he sees one come to hire it \n For any feast, he asks the cook the name \n Of him who gives the feast, and then as soon \n As the door opens, in he walks the first. \n But this man has no hesitation, like the excellent Magnus, even to make\n excursions quite beyond the boundaries for the sake of his stomach, as Alexis said\n in his Men who Died together\u2014 \n Ch\u00e6rephon comes to Corinth for a supper, \n Though he has never had an invitation; \n But still he flies across the sea, so sweet \n It is to eat of what another pays for. \n \n And Theopompus, in his Ulysses, says\u2014 \n Well said Euripides, \"It is not bad \n For a rich man to dine at other's cost.\" \n \n \n ","58":"\n And when all laughed at this, Ulpian said, Whence do the voluptuaries who talk so\n loosely get all their elegance of expression? And Cynulcus replied, But, O you\n well-seasoned little pig, Phrynichus the Cynic poet, in his Ephiates, mentions\n the elegant speaker in these terms:\u2014 \n Is is the hardest work of all to guard against such men; \n For they do carry always at their finger's end a sting, \n The misanthropic flower of youth; and then they fawn on all \n With carefully selected sweetness of expression, \n Always the forum haunting when the citizens are seated; \n And then they lacerate with wounds severe and unexpected \n Those whom they have been fawning on, and hide themselves and laugh. \n And the word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd (to speak so\n as to please) is used by Aeschylus in the Prometheus Vinctus\u2014 \n You shall know this for true; nor is it mine \n \n \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd. \n \n And when Ulpian said again, But what, my friends, is meant by cooks'\n instruments? for these things were mentioned, and were thought worthy of being\n enumerated in the Arcadian banquets: and also where is the word \u1f00\u03c3\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (abode of luxury) to be found? For I know that\n the adjective \u1f04\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is common enough. And Alexis\n speaks of a luxurious extravagant man in his Cnidia, saying\u2014 \n Diodorus, most extravagant of men, \n In two brief years did make his patrimony \n Into a football, with such headlong speed \n Did he devour everything. \n And again, in the Ph\u00e6drus, he says\u2014 \n You tell me of a very slow proceeding; \n For in five days the little Epicharides \n Made ducks and drakes of all his father's property, \n So quickly and entirely did he swallow it. \n \n \n ","59":"\n And Ctesippus the son of Chabrias carried hi extravagance and intemperance to such\n a height, that he old even the stones of his father's tomb, on which the Athenians\n had spent a thousand drachm\u00e6, to furnish means for his luxury. And accordingly\n Diphilus says in his Men offering Sacrifices to the Dead\u2014 \n \n If Chabrias's son, the young Ctesippus, \n Had not become a friend of Ph\u00e6dimus, \n I should have brought a wholesome law forward \n To cause his father's monument to be finished. \n That each of all the citizens should give \n A stone of size to fill a waggon, and \n I say that that would not be much for him. \n And Timocles, in his Demosatyri, says\u2014 \n Ctesippus, the fine son of Chabrias, \n Has ceased to shave himself three times a-day. \n A great man among women, not with men. \n And Menander, in his Anger, says this of him\u2014 \n And I too once was a young man, O woman, \n Nor did I then five several times a-day \n Bathe, as I now do bathe; nor at that time \n Had I a soft cloak, such as now I have, \n Nor such perfumes as now; now I will paint myself, \n And pluck my hair, by Jove. Aye, I will be \n Ctesippus, not a man; and in brief time \n I too, like him, will eat up all the stones, \n For I'll not be content with earth alone. \n And perhaps it was on account of this extravagant luxury and debauchery\n that Demosthenes has handed down his name in his treatise on Immunities. But those\n who have devoured their patrimony ought to be punished in such a way as this, like\n the Nauclerus of Menander. For Menander says\u2014 \n O dearest mother of all mortals, Earth, \n How kind you are to all possess'd of sense; \n How worthy of all honour!

And he uses the following expressions\u2014 And he so far exceeded the\n whole nation of the Tarentines in luxury and extravagance, that this latter is\n only im- moderate in its indulgence in feasts; but he spent on his luxury even\n the revenues of the Athenian people. But Callistratus, he continues,\n the son of Callicrates, who was himself also a demagogue, was very\n intemperate in his pleasures, but still he was very attentive to the business\n of the state. And speaking of the Tarentines, in the fifty-second book\n of his Histories, he writes as follows\u2014 The city of the Tarentines\n sacrifices oxen nearly every month, and celebrates public festivals; and the\n chief body of private individuals is always occupied in banquets and drinking\n parties. And the Tarentines hold some such language as this: That other men,\n because they are fond of personal exertion, and because they devote themselves\n to actual labour, prepare their subsistence in this way for the future: but\n that they, by means of their banquets and pleasures, are not about to live, but\n are living already. \n \n ","61":"\n But concerning the intemperance and general habits and life of Philip and his\n companions, Theopompus gives the following account, in the forty-ninth book of his\n Histories\u2014 When Philip became master of great treasures, he did not spend\n them quickly, but he threw them away and squandered them; being of all the men\n that ever lived, not only the worst manager himself, but all those who were\n about him were so too. For absolutely not one of them had any idea of living\n properly, or of managing his household with moderation. And of that he himself\n was the cause, being a most insatiable and extravagant man, doing everything in\n an offhand manner, whether he was acquiring property or giving it away. For\n though he was a soldier, he was unable, out of pure laziness, to count what he\n had coming in and what he spent. And then his companions were men collected\n together from all quarters; for some of them came from his\n own country, and some from Thessaly, and some from other parts of Greece, not\n being selected with any care; but if among either Greeks or barbarians there\n was any lascivious, or im- pure, or avaricious man, he had almost every one of\n the same character assembled in Macedonia, and they were all called friends of\n Philip. And even if any one came who was not entirely of that disposition,\n still under the influence of the life and manners of the Macedonians, he very\n soon became like the rest. For their wars, and military expeditions, and other\n great expenses, encouraged them to be audacious, and to live, not in an orderly\n manner, but after a prodigal fashion and like robbers. \n \n ","62":"\n But Duris, in the seventh book of his History of the Affairs of Macedonia,\n speaking of Pasicyprus the king of Cyprus, and of his intemperate habits, writes\n as follows\u2014 Alexander, after the siege of Tyre, dismissed Pnytagoras, and\n gave him many presents, and among them he gave him the fortified place which he\n asked for. And that very place Pasicyprus the king had previously sold, in a\n luxurious freak, for fifty talents, to Pymatus the Citti\u00e6an, selling him both\n the fortress itself and his own royal authority over it. And when he had\n received the money he grew old in Amathus. Such also was Aethiops the\n Corinthian, as Demetrius the Scepsian relates, of whom mention is made by\n Archilochus; for he, out of his love of pleasure and intemperance, sailing\n with Archias to Sicily when he was about to found Syracuse, sold to his\n messmate for a cake of honey the lot which he had just drawn, and was about to\n take possession of in Syracuse. \n \n ","63":"\n But Demetrius carried his extravagance to such a height, he, I mean, who was the\n descendant of Demetrius Phalereus, according to the account of Hegesander, that he\n had Aristagora the Corinthian for a mistress, and lived in a most expensive\n manner. And when the Areopagit\u00e6 summoned him before them, and ordered him to live\n more decorously\u2014 But even now, said he, I live like a\n gentleman, for I have a most beautiful mistress, and I do no wrong to any one,\n and I drink Chian wine, and I have a sufficiency of everything, as my own\n revenues suffice for all these expenses. And I do not live as some of you do,\n corrupted by bribes myself, and intriguing with other\n men's wives. And hereupon he enumerated some who acted in this manner\n by name. And Antigonus the king, having heard this, made him a thesmothete. And\n he, being an hipparch at the Panathen\u00e6a, erected a seat close to the statues of\n Mercury for Aristagora, higher than the Mercuries themselves. And when the\n mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis, he placed a seat for her close to the\n temple, saying that those who endeavored to hinder him should repent it. \n ","64":"\n But Phanodemus, and also Philochorus, have related that in former times the judges\n of the Areopagus used to summon before them and to punish profligate and\n extravagant men, and those who had no ostensible means of living: and many others\n have told the same story. At all events, those judges sent for Menedemus and\n Asclepiades the philosophers when they were young men and poor, and asked them how\n they managed to look so sleek and comfortable when they spent the whole day idling\n with philosophers, and had no property. And they replied that some one of the men\n about the mill had better be sent for. And when he came and said that they came\n every night to the mill and threshed and ground the corn, and each earned two\n drachm\u00e6, the judges of the Areopagus marvelled, and presented them with two\n hundred drachm\u00e6 as a reward. \n And the citizens of Abdera brought Democritus to trial, on the ground that he had\n wasted the estate which he had inherited from his father. And when he had read to\n them his Great World, and his treatise concerning the Things in the Shades below,\n and had said that he had spent it on these works, he was discharged. \n ","65":"\n But those men who are not so luxurious, as Amphis says\u2014 \n Drink two entire days in every day, \n Shaking their heads through their too mighty draughts. \n And according to Diphilus\u2014 \n Having three heads, like to Diana's statue. \n Being enemies to their own estate, as Satyrus in his treatise on\n Characters said, running through their land, tearing to pieces and plundering\n their own houses, selling their own property as if it were the spoils of the\n enemy, considering not what has been spent, but what will be spent, and not what will remain afterwards, but what will not remain, having\n spent beforehand in their youth the money which ought to have carried them safely\n through old age, rejoicing in companionship, not in companions, and in their wine,\n and not in those who drink it with them. But Agatharchides the Corinthian, in the\n twenty-eighth book of his Commentary on the Affairs of Europe, says that\n Gnosippus, who was a very luxurious and extravagant man in Sparta, was\n forbidden by the Ephori to hold intercourse with the young men. And\n among the Romans, it is related, according to the statement of Posidonius, in the\n forty-ninth book of his Histories, that there was a man named Apicius who went\n beyond all other men in intemperance. This is that Apicius who was the cause of\n banishment to Rutilius, who wrote the history of the Romans in the Greek language.\n But concerning Apicius, the man, I mean, who is so notorious for his extravagant\n luxury, we have already spoken in our first book. \n ","66":"\n But Diogenes the Babylonian, in his treatise on Nobility of Birth, says\n that the son of Phocion, whose name was Phocus, was such a man that\n there was not one Athenian who did not hate him.

For he had\n expended all his patrimony on intemperance; and after this he became a\n flatterer of the prefect of Munychia; on which account he was again attacked\n and reproached by every one. And once, when a voluntary contribution was being\n made, he came forward and said, before the whole assembly, ' I, too, contribute\n my share.' And the Athenians all with one accord cried out, 'Yes, to\n profligacy.' And Phocus was a man very fond of drinking hard; and accordingly,\n when he had conquered with horses at the Panathen\u00e6a, and when Sopater\n entertained his companions at a banquet, the preparation was very splendid, and\n foot-tubs full of wine and spices were set before all who came in. And his\n father, seeing this, called Phocus, and said, 'Will you not stop your companion\n from polluting your victory in this fashion?' \n \n And I know too of many other intemperate and extravagant men, whom I leave you to\n find out, with the exception of Callias the son of Hipponicus, whom even the\n tutors of little children have heard of.

Menander, in his False Hercules, blaming the\n cooks as attempting what they ought not, says\u2014 \n Holloa, you cook, why do you sulky seem? \n 'Tis the third time you've asked me what's the number \n Of tables which will be required to-day. \n We go to sacrifice one little pig. \n Eight tables are required, or two, or one; \n What can that be to you?\u2014I want but one. \n May we not make some candyli and\n dishes \n Such as you're used to season; honey, eggs, \n And semilago; but now everything \n Is contrary; the cook makes cakes in moulds, \n Roasts cheesecakes, and boils groats, and brings on table \n After the salted meats fig-leaves and grapes. \n And for the sweetmeat-makers, they, with duties \n Turn'd upside down, roast joints of meat and thrushed \n Instead of delicate confections; thus \n He who believes he sups doth feed on dainties, \n And when perfumed and crown'd, again doth feast \n On honey'd cheese-cakes interspersed with thrushes. \n \n But that all these different duties were formerly separated,\n when the demiurgi, as they called them, attended to the sweetmeats, and the cooks\n to the regular cookery, Antiphanes shows us plainly enough, in his Chrysis, where\n he says\u2014 \n Four female flute-players do have their wages, \n Twelve cooks, and just as many sweetmeat-makers, \n Asking for plates for honey. \n And Menander, in his Demiurgus, says\u2014 \n \n A. What now is this, my boy, for you, by Jove, \n Have come in a most business-like set fashion. \n \n B. Yes, for we are inventing fine inventions, \n And all the night long we've been hard at work, \n And even now we have much left unfinish'd. \n But Seleucus says that Panyasis is the earliest author who speaks of\n sweetmeats, in the book in which he speaks of the human sacrifices practised by\n the Egyptians, saying that many sorts of pastry and sweetmeats are put on the\n table, and many kinds of young birds. And before his time Stesichorus, or Ibycus,\n in the poem entitled the Contest, wrote as follows:\u2014- \n Bring gifts unto the maiden, cakes of cesane, \n And groats, and cakes of oil and honey mixed, \n And other kinds of pastry, and fresh honey. \n But that this poem is the work of Stesichorus, Simonides the poet is a\n most undeniable witness; who, when speaking of Meleager, says\u2014 \n Who with the spear excell'd his fellows all, \n Hurling beyond the eddying Anauros \n From the grape-famous Iolcos. \n For thus did Homer and Stesichorus \n Sing to the nations. \n For Stesichorus had sung so in the previously quoted poem, namely, the\n Contests\u2014 \n Amphiaraus gain'd the prize in leaping, \n And with the dart the godlike Meleager. \n \n \n ","72":"\n But I am not ignorant of what Apollodorus the Athenian has said of the Delians,\n that they supplied all who came to their sacred ceremonies with the assistance of\n cooks and table-setters; and from their actions they were named Magis and\n Gongylis;\u2014since, says Aristophanes, they furnished them at these banquets with\n round barley-cakes, ( \u03b3\u03cc\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1\u03b9, ) as if they\n had been women. And even to this very day some of them are called Ch\u0153raci, and\n Amni, and Artysilai, and Sesami, and Artusitragi, and\n Neocori, and Icthyboli. And of the women, some are called Cuminanth\u00e6. But all are\n called by one common name Eleodyt\u00e6, because they attend on the kitchen tables, and\n minister at the festivals. For \u1f14\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 means a\n kitchen or cook's table. Homer says\u2014 \n But when he roasted the meat, and placed it \u1f10\u03bd\n \u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u1fd6\u03bd. \n \n On which account, also, Polycraton the son of Crithon, a Rhen\u00e6an, when\n instituting a prosecution against hem, did not call them Delians, but inscribed\n his action against the whole body of the Eleodyt\u00e6. And the law of\n the Amphictyons commands the Eleodyt\u00e6 to provide water; meaning by Eleodyt\u00e6 the\n table-setters, and all attendants of that sort. But Criton the comic poet, in his\n Busy-body, calls the Delians the parasites of the god, in these lines\u2014 \n When we had forced this great Ph\u0153nician, \n The master of a well-provided purse, \n Though captain of the ship, to stay in harbour, \n And * * * two ships \n To come to Delos from Pir\u00e6us' port; \n He heard from all men that this place alone \n Seem'd to have three good things for a parasite, \n A well-stored market, a large population \n From every country, and the native Delians, \n Themselves a tribe of parasites of the god. \n \n \n ","73":"\n But Ach\u00e6us the Eretrian, in his Alcm\u00e6on, a satyric drama, calls the Delphians\n makers of sauces, in these words:\u2014 \n I see the sauce-makers, and spit on them. \n Inasmuch, forsooth, as they cut up the victims, it is plain that they\n cooked and seasoned them; and, having a regard to these facts, Aristophanes also\n said\u2014 \n But O thou Ph\u0153bus, thou who sharpenest \n The Delphian knives, and with an early warning \n Givest instruction to thy ministers. \n And, in the lines immediately following the former passage, Ach\u00e6us says\u2014\n \n Why do you stay conceal'd, \n Namesake of all the knives which cooks employ \n For the Satyrs ridicule the Delphians, as devoting all their time and\n attention to festivals and sacrifices. And Semus says, in the fourth book of his\n Deliad, The Delians used to provide the Delphians who came to Delos with\n salt, ad vinegar, and oil, and wood, and counterpanes. And Arisotle, or\n Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, speaking of the Magne-\n sians who dwell on the banks of the river M\u00e6ander, as colonists of the Delphians,\n represents them as showing the same attentions to all foreigners who came to them;\n speaking as follows: \u2014 The Magnesians who dwell on the banks of the river\n M\u00e6ander, being sacred to the god, and colonists of the Delphians, give shelter\n to all who come among them, and salt, and oil, and vinegar, and lights, and\n beds, and coverlets, and tables. But Demetrius the Scepsian, in the\n sixteenth book of his Trojan Array, says that in Laconia, on the road which is\n called the Hyacinthine road, statues of the heroes Daiton and Ceraon were erected\n by those who made barley-cakes at the Phiditia, and by the attendants who mixed\n the wine. And the same writer reports also, in the twenty-fourth book of the same\n work, that Daitas the hero is worshipped among the Trojans, who is also mentioned\n by Mimnermus. And Hegesander the Delphian says that Jupiter is worshipped in\n Cyprus, under the names of Eilapinastes or the Feaster, and of Splanchnotomus or\n the Carver of Entrails. \n ","74":"\n And while much such conversation as this was proceed- ing, on a sudden a noise was\n heard from some one of the neighbouring places, as from an hydraulic organ, very\n pleasant and agreeable, so that we all turned round towards it, being charmed by\n the melody; and Ulpian looking towards the musical Alcides said, Do you hear, O\n you most musical of men, this beautiful harmony which has made us turn round,\n being enchanted by the music? And is it not the case, as it is said to be among\n you Alexandrians, that constant music of an unaccompanied flute causes pain rather\n than any musical pleasure to those who hear it? And Alcides said,\u2014But this engine,\n the hydraulic organ, whether you choose to class it among stringed instruments or\n among wind instruments, is the invention of a fellow-countryman of ours, an\n Alexandrian, a barber by trade; and his name is Ctesibius. And Aristocles reports\n this, in his book on Choruses, saying\u2014 The question is asked, whether the\n hydraulic organ is a stringed instrument or a wind instrument. Now\n Aristoxenus did not feel sure on this point; but it is said, that Plato showed a\n sort of notion of the invention, making a nightly clock like the hydraulic organ;\n being very like an enormous hour-glass. And, indeed, the hydraulic organ does seem\n to be a kind of hour-glass. It cannot, therefore, be\n considered a stringed instrument, and one to be played by touching. But perhaps it\n may be called a wind instrument, because the organ is inflated by the water; for\n the pipes are plunged down into the water, and when the water is agitated by a\n youth, as the axles penetrate through the whole organ, the pipes are inflated, and\n emit a gentle and agreeable sound. And this organ is like a round altar; and they\n say that it was invented by Ctesibius the barber, who dwelt at that time in the\n territory of Aspendor, in the reign of the second Ptolemy surnamed Euergetes; and\n they say that he was a very eminent man; they say also, that he learnt a good deal\n from his wife Thais. But Trypho, in the third book of his treatise on Names, (and\n it is a dissertation on Flutes and Organs,) says Ctesibius the mechanic wrote a\n book about the hydraulis; but I am not sure that he is not mistaken as to the\n name. At all events, Aristoxenus prefers stringed instruments which are played\n upon by the touch to wind instruments; saying that wind instruments are very easy;\n for that many people, without having been taught, can play on the flute and pipe,\n as for instance, shepherds. \n ","75":"\n And this is what I have got to say to you about the hydraulic organ, O Ulpian. For\n the Phoenicians used a kind of flute called the gingras, according to the account\n of Xenophon, about a span in length, and of a very shrill and mournful tone. And\n the same instrument is used also by the Carians in their wailings, unless, indeed,\n when he says Ph\u0153nicia he means Caria; and indeed you may find the name used so in\n Corinna and in Bacchylides. And these flutes are called gingri by the Ph\u0153nicians\n from the lamentations for Adonis; for you Phoenicians called Adonis Gingres, as\n Democlides tells us. And Antiphanes mentions the gingri flutes, in his Physician;\n and Menander does so too, in his Carina; and Amphis, in his Dithyrambus, saying\u2014\n \n \n A. And I have got that admirable gingras. \n \n B. What is the gingras. \n \n A. 'Tis a new invention \n Of our countryman, which never yet \n Has been exhibited in any theatre, \n But is a luxury of Athenian banquets. \n \n B. Why then not introduce it to this people? \n \n A. Because I think that I shall draw by lot \n Some most ambitious tribe; for well I know \n They would disturb all things with their applause. \n \n And Axionicus says, in his Phileuripides\u2014 \n For they are both so sick with love \n Of the melodious strains of soft Euripides, \n That every other music seems to them \n Shrill as the gingras, and a mere misfortune. \n \n \n ","76":"\n But how much better, O most sagacious Ulpian, is this hydraulic organ, than the\n instrument which is called nabla; which Sopater the parodist, in his drama\n entitled Pyl\u00e6, says is also an invention of the Phoenicians, using the following\n expressions\u2014 \n Nor is the noise of the Sidonian nabla, \n Which from the throat doth flow, at all impair'd. \n And in the Slave of Mystacus we find\u2014 \n Among the instruments of harmony \n The nablas comes, not over soft or sweet; \n By its long sides a lifeless lotus fix'd \n Sends forth a breathed music; and excites men, \n Singing in Bacchic strain a merry song. \n And Philemon says, in his Adulterer\u2014 \n \n A. There should, O Parmeno, be here among us \n A nablas or a female flute-player. \n \n B. What is a nablas? \n \n A. Don't you know? you idiot! \n \n B. Indeed I don't. \n \n A. What, do not know a nablas l \n You know no good; perhaps a sambucistria \n You ne'er have heard of either? \n There is also an instrument called the triangle, which Juba mentions in\n the fourth book of his Theatrical History, and says it is an invention of the\n Syrians; as is also the sambuca, which is called \u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03be. But this instrument Neanthes the Cyzicene, in the first\n book of his Seasons, says is an invention of Ibycus the Rhegian poet; as also the\n lyre called barbitos was of Anacreon. But since you are running all us\n Alexandrians down as unmusical, and keep mentioning the monaulos as our only\n national instrument, listen now to what I can tell you offhand about that. \n ","77":"\n For Juba, in the before-mentioned treatise, says that the Egyptians call the\n monaulos an invention of Osiris, just as they say that kind of plagiaulos is,\n which is called photinx, and that, too, I will presently show you is mentioned by\n a very illustrious author; for the photinx is the same as the flute, which is a\n national instrument. But Sophocles, in his Thamyras, speaks of the monaulos,\n saying\u2014 \n \n For all the tuneful melodies of pipes ( \u03c0\u03ae\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) \n Are lost, the lyre, and monaulos too. \n * * * * And Araros, in his Birth of Pan, says\u2014 \n But he, can you believe it? seized at once \n On the monaulos, and leapt lightly forth. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Treasure, says\u2014 \n I the monaulos took, and sang a wedding song. \n And in his Bottle-bearer he says\u2014 \n \n A. What have you done, you Syrian, with your\n monaulos? \n \n B. What monaulos? \n \n A. The reed. \n And Sopater, in his Bacchis, says\u2014 \n And then he sang a song on the monaulos. \n But Protagorides of Cyzicus, in the second book of his treatise on the\n Assemblies in Honour of Daphne, says, \"He touched every kind of instrument, one\n after another, castanets, the weak-sounding pandurus, but he drew the sweetest\n harmony from the sweet monaulos. And Posidonius the Stoic philosopher, in the\n third book of his Histories, speaking of the war of the Apameans against the\n Laris\u00e6ans, writes as follows\u2014 Having taken short daggers sticking in their\n waists, and small lances covered with rust and dirt, and having put veils and\n curtains over their heads which produce a shade but do not hinder the wind from\n getting to their necks, dragging on asses laden with wine and every sort of\n meat, by the side of which were packed little photinges and little monauli,\n instruments of revelry, not of war. But I am not ignorant that Amerias\n the Macedonian, in his Dialects, says, that the monaulos is called tityrinus. So\n here you have, O excellent Ulpian, a man who mentions the photinx. But that the\n monaulos was the same instrument which is now called calamaules, or reedfife, is\n clearly shown by Hedylus, in his Epigrams, where he says\u2014 \n Beneath this mound the tuneful Theon lies, \n Whom the monaulos knew its sweetest lord; \n Scirpalus' son; age had destroy'd his sight, \n And when he was a child his sire him call'd \n Eupalamus in his first birthday ode, \n Showing that he was a choice bouquet where \n The virtues all had met. For well he sung \n The Muses' sports amid their wine-glad revels; \n \n He sang to Battalus, an eager drinker \n Of unmix'd wine, and Cotalus and P\u00e6ncalus. \n Say then to Theon with his calamaules, \n Farewell, O Theon, tune fullest of men. \n As, therefore, they now call those who play on a pipe of reeds ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 ) calamaules, so also they call them now\n rapaules, according to the statement of Amerias the Macedonian, in his\n dialects. \n ","78":"\n But I wish you to know, my most excellent Ulpian, that a more musical and\n accomplished people than the Alexandrians is not mentioned. And I do not speak\n only of playing on the harp, with which even the poorest people among us, and\n those who do not make a profession of it, and who are utterly ignorant of every\n other kind of learning, are so familiarized that they can in a moment detect any\n error which has been made in striking the strings,\u2014but especially are they skilful\n with the flute; and not only in those which are called girls' flutes and boys'\n flutes, but also in men's flutes, which are called perfect and superperfect; and\n also in those which are called harp-flutes and finger-flutes. For the flutes\n called elymi, which Sophocles mentions in his Niobe and in his Drummers, we do not\n understand to be anything but the common Phrygian flute. And these, too, the\n Alexandrians are very skilful in. They are acquainted also with the flute with two\n holes, and also with the intermediate flute, and with those which are called\n hypotreti, or bored underneath. And Callias also speaks of the flute called elymi,\n in his Pedet\u00e6. But Juba says that they are an invention of the Phrygians, and that\n they were also called scytali\u00e6, from their resemblance in thickness to the\n scytale. And Cratinus the younger says that the Cyprians also use them, in his\n Thera- menes. We know, too, of some which are called half-bored, of which Anacreon\n says\u2014 \n What lust has now seized thus upon your mind, \n To wish to dance to tender half-bored flutes? \n And these flutes are smaller than the perfect flutes. At all events,\n Aeschylus says, speaking metaphorically, in his Ixion\u2014 \n But very soon the greater swallows up \n The lesser and the half-bored flute. \n And these half-bored flutes are the same as those which are called boys'\n flutes, which they use at banquets, not being fit for the\n games and public shows; on which account Anacreon called them tender. \n ","79":"\n I am acquainted, too, with other kinds of flutes, the tragic flute, and the\n lysiodic flute, and the harplike\n flute; all which are mentioned by Ephorus, in his Inventions and by Euphranor the\n Pythagorean, in his treatise on Flutes, and also by Alexon, who wrote another\n treatise on Flutes. But the flute made of reeds is called tityrinus among the\n Dorians in Italy, as Artemidorus the Aristophanian tells us, in the second book of\n his History of Doris. And the flute which is called magadis, which is also named\n pal\u00e6o-magais, sends forth a sharp and a deep note at the same time, as\n Anaxandrides says in his Armed Fighter\u2014 \n I will speak like a magadis, both loudly and gently \n And the flutes called lotus flutes are the same which are called\n photinges by the Alexandrians; and they are made of the plant called the lotus;\n and this is a wood which grows in Libya. But Juba says that the flute which is ma\n e out of the leg bones of the kid is an invention of the Thebans; and Tryphon says\n that those flutes also which are called elphantine flutes were first bored among\n the Phoenicians. I know, too, that the magadis is a stringed instrument, as is the\n harp, the lyre, and the barbitos. But Euphorion the epic poet says in his book on\n the Isthmian Games\u2014 Those men who are now called players on the nablas, and\n on the pandurus, and on the sambuca, do not use any new instrument, for the\n baromus and the barbitos (both of which are mentioned by Sappho and Anacreon),\n and the magadis, and the triangle, and the sambuca are all ancient instruments.\n At all events, a statue of one of the Muses was erected in Mitylee by\n Lesbothemis, holding a sambuca in her hand. But Aristoxenus calls the\n following foreign instruments\u2014ph\u0153nices, and pectides, and magadides, and sambuc\u00e6,\n and triagles, and clepsiambi, and scindapsi, and the instrument called the\n enneachord or nine-stringed instrument. But Plato, in the third book of his\n Polity, states\u2014 ' We shall not, hen,' said I, 'have much need of many\n strings or of much harmony in our songs and melodies.' 'I think not,' said he.\n 'But we shall have triangles, and pectides, and all sorts\n of instruments which have many strings and are very harmonious.' \n \n ","80":"\n But the scindapsus is an instrument of four strings, as Matron the parodist says\n in the following lines\u2014 \n Nor did they hang it upon pegs where hung \n The sweet scindapsus with its fourfold strings, \n Joy of the woman who the distaff hates. \n And Theopompus the Colophonian likewise mentions it, the Epic poet, I\n mean, in his poem entitled the Chariot\u2014 \n Shaking the large and lyre-toned scindapsus, \n Made of young tamarisk, in his skilful hand. \n Anaxilas, too, in his Lyre Maker, says\u2014 \n But I was making three-string'd barbiti, \n Pectides, cithar\u00e6, lyres, and scindapsi. \n But Sopater the parodist, in his poem entitled The\n Initiated, says that the pectis is an instrument with two strings,\n saying\u2014 \n The pectis, proud of its barbaric muse, \n With its two strings was placed within my hand. \n The instrument called pariambis is mentioned by Epicharmus, in his\n Periallus, in this way\u2014 \n But Semele doth dance and he doth sing \n Tunefully on his pariambis lyre, \n And she rejoices at the rapid song. \n Now it was Alexander of Cythera, according to the account given by Juba,\n who completed the psaltery with its full number of strings. And he, when he had\n grown old in the city of the Ephesians, suspended this instrument in the temple of\n Diana, as being the most skilful invention he had made with reference to his art.\n Juba mentions also the lyroph\u0153nix and the Epigonius, which, though now it is\n transformed into the upright psaltery, still preserves the name of the man who was\n the first to use it. But Epigonius was by birth an Ambraciot, but he was\n subsequently made a citizen of Sicyon. And he was a man of great skill in music,\n so that he played the lyre with his bare hand without a plectrum. For the\n Alexandrians have great experience and skill in all the above-named instruments\n and kinds of flutes. . And whichever of them you wish me to try, I will exhibit my\n own skill before you, though there are many others in my country more musical and\n skilful than I am. \n \n ","81":"\n But Alexander, my fellow-citizen, and he has only lately died, having given a\n public exhibition of his skill on the instrument called the triangle, made all the\n Romans so music-mad that even now most people recollect the way in which he used\n to play. And Sophocles speaks of this triangle in his Mysians, saying\u2014 \n The constant music of the Phrygian \n Tender triangle, and the concerted strains \n Of the shrill Lydian pectis sounded too. \n And in his Thamyras he also mentions it. But Aristophanes, in his\n Daitaleis, and Theopompus, in his Penelope, likewise speak of it. And Eupolis, in\n his Bapt\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Who plays the drum with wondrous skill, \n And strikes the strings of the triangle. \n And the instrument called the pandurus is mentioned, as has been said\n before, by Euphorion, and by Protagorides, in the second book of his treatise on\n the Assemblies in honour of Daphne. But Pythagoras, who wrote a book on the Red\n Sea, says that the Troglodyt\u00e6 make the panduri out of the daphne which grows on\n the seashore. \n But horns and trumpets are the invention of the Etrurians. But Metrodorus the\n Chian, in his history of the Affairs of Troy, says that Marsyas invented the pipe\n and flute at Cel\u00e6n\u00e6, when all his predecessors had played on a single reed. But\n Euphorion the epic poet, in his treatise on the Modulation of Songs, says that\n Mercury invented the pipe which consists of one single reed; but that some say\n that Seuthes and Ronaces the Medes did so; and that Sileuus invented the pipe\n which is made of many reeds, and that Marsyas invented that one which is joined\n together with wax. \n ","82":"\n This then, O my word-hunting Ulpian, is what you may learn from us Alexandrians,\n who are very fond of the music of the monaulos. For you do not know that Menecles\n the Barc\u00e6man compiler, and also that Andron, in his Chronicles, him of Alexandria\n I mean, assert that it is the Alexandrians who instructed all the Greeks and the\n barbarians, when the former encyclic mode of education began to fail, on account\n of the incessant commotions which took place in the times of the successors of\n Alexander. There was subsequently a generation of all sorts of learning in the\n time of Ptolemy the seventh king of Egypt, the one who was properly called by the\n Alex- andrians Cacergetes; for he having murdered many of the\n Alexandrians, and banished no small number of those who had grown up to manhood\n with his brother, filled all the islands and cities with men learned in grammar,\n and philosophy, and geometry, with musicians, and painters, and schoolmasters, and\n physicians, and men of all kinds of trades and professions; who, being driven by\n poverty to teach what they knew, produced a great number of celebrated pupils. \n ","83":"\n But music was a favourite amusement of all the Greeks of old time; on which\n account also skill in playing the flute was much aimed at. Accordingly, Cham\u00e6leon\n of Heraclia, in his book entitled Protrepticus, says that the Laced\u00e6monians and\n Thebans all learned to play on the flute, and the inhabitants of Heraclea in\n Pontus devoted themselves to the same study down to his own time. And that so did\n the most illustrious of the Athenians, Callias the son of Hipponicus, and Critias\n the son of Callaeschrus. But Duris, in his treatise on Euripides and Sophocles,\n says that Alcibiades learnt music, not of any ordinary master, but of Pronomus,\n who had the very highest reputation in that line. And Aristoxenus says that\n Epaminondas the Theban learnt to play the flute of Olympiodorus and Orthagoras.\n And likewise, many of the Pythagoreans practised the art of flute-playing, as\n Euphranor, and Archytas, and Philolaus, and many others. But Euphranor has also\n left behind an essay on Flutes, and so too has Archytas. And Aristophanes shows\n us, in his Daitaleis, the great eagerness with which men applied themselves to\n this study, when he says\u2014 \n I who am wasted quite away \n In the study of flutes and harps, \n Am I now to be sent to dig? \n And Phrynichus, in his Ephialtes, says\u2014 \n But were not you the man who taught him once \n To play upon the flute and well-strung harp? \n And Epicharmus, in his Muses, says that Minerva played a martial strain\n to the Dioscuri. And Ion, in his Ph\u0153nician, or C\u00e6neus, calls the flute a cock,\n speaking thus:\u2014 \n The cock then sang the Greeks a Lydian hymn. \n And also, in his Garrison, he calls the pipe the Id\u00e6an cock, using the\n following expression:\u2014 \n The pipe, th' Id\u00e6an cock, precedes your steps. \n \n And, in the Second Ph\u0153nix, the same Ion writes\u2014 \n I made a noise, bringing the deep-toned flute \n With fluent rhythm. \n Where he means Phrygian rhythm; and he calls the Phrygian flute\n deep-toned. For it is deep; on which account they also add a horn to it, having a\n similarity to the bell mouth of trumpets. \n So now this book may be ended, my friend Timocrates; as it is quite long\n enough. \n "},"4":{"0":"\n BUT since, O Timocrates, we have now had a great deal of conversation on the\n subject of banquets in all that has been hitherto said; and since we have passed\n over those things in them which are most useful and which do not weigh down the\n soul, but which cheer it, and nourish it by variety of food, as the divine Homer\n incidentally teaches us, I will also mention what has been said concerning these\n things by that most excellent writer Masyrius. For we, as the beautiful Agathon\n says\u2014 \n Do what is more than needful as if needful, \n And treat our real work as if it were superfluous. \n The poet accordingly says, when he is speaking of Menelaus\u2014 \n At the fair dome the rapid labour ends, \n \n Where sat Atrides 'midst his bridal friends, \n With double vows invoking Hymen's power \n To bless his son's and daughter's nuptial hour:\u2014 \n as it was a custom to celebrate banquets at marriages, both for the sake\n of the gods who preside over marriage, and as it were for a testimony to the\n marriage; and also, the king of Lycia instructs us what sort of banquet ought to\n be given to foreigners, receiving Bellerophon with great magnificence\u2014 \n There Lycia's monarch paid him honours due, \n \n Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew. \n \n \n ","1":"\n For wine appears to have a very attractive influence in promoting friendship, as\n it warms and also melts the soul. On which account the\n ancients did not ask who a man was before drinking, but afterwards; as honouring\n the laws of hospitality itself, and not this or that particular individual. But\n the lawgivers, taking care beforehand of the banquets of the present day, have\n appointed feasts for the tribe, and feasts for the borough; and also general\n banquets, and entertainments to the ward, and others also called orgeonica. And\n there are many meetings of philosophers in the city, some called the pupils of\n Diogenes, and others, pupils of Antipater, others again styled disciples of\n Pan\u00e6tius. And Theophrastus bequeathed money for an entertainment of that sort.\n Not, by Jove, in order that the philosophers assembled might indulge in\n intemperance, but in order that during the banquet they might have a wise and\n learned conversation. And the Prytanes were accustomed every day to meet in\n well-regulated banquets, which tended to the advantage of the state. And it was to\n such a banquet as that Demosthenes says the news of the taking of Elatea was\n brought. For it was evening, and a man came bringing news to the Prytanes\n that Elatea was taken. And the philosophers used to be careful to\n collect the young men, and to feast with them according to some well-considered\n and carefully laid down law. Accordingly, there were some laws for banquets laid\n down by Xenocrates, in the Academy, and again by Aristotle. \n But the Phiditia in Sparta, and the Andrea, or man's feasts, among the Cretans,\n were celebrated in their respective cities with all imaginable care. On which\n account some one said not unwisely\u2014 \n Dear friends should never long abstain from feasts, \n For e'en the memory of them is delightful. \n And Antipater the philosopher once assembled a banqueting party, and\n invited all the guests on the understanding that they were to discuss subtle\n questions. And they say that Arcesilaus, being once invited to a banquet, and\n sitting next to a man who ate voraciously, while he himself was unable to enjoy\n anything, when some one of those who were present offered him something, said\u2014\n \n May it be well with you; be this for Telephus: \n for it so happened that the epicure by his side was named Telephus. But\n Zeno, when some epicure who was at the same party with him snatched away the upper\n half of the fish the moment that it was placed on the table,\n turned the fish round himself, and took the remaining portion, saying\u2014 \n Then Ino came and finish'd what was left. \n And Socrates seeing a man once devouring dainties eagerly, Said\u2014O you\n bystanders, which of you eats bread as if it were sweetmeats, and sweetmeats as if\n they were bread? \n ","2":"\n But now let us speak of the banquets celebrated by Homer. For the poet gives us\n the different times of them, and the persons present, and the causes of them. And\n Xenophon and Plato have done well to imitate him in this; who at the very\n beginning of their treatises set forth the cause which gave rise to the banquet,\n and mention the names of those who were present. But Epicurus never defines either\n the place or the time, nor does he preface his accounts with any preliminary\n statement. But Aristotle says that it is an unseemly thing for a man to come\n unwashed and covered with dust to a banquet. Then Homer instructs us who ought to\n be invited; saying that one ought to invite the chiefs, and men of high\n reputation\u2014 \n He bade the noblest of the Grecian peers, \n \n not acting on the principle asserted by Hesiod, for he bids men invite\n chiefly their neighbours\u2014 \n Then bid your neighbours to the well-spread feast, \n Who live the nearest, and who know you best. \n \n For such a banquet would be one of rustic stupidity; and adapted to the\n most misanthropic of proverbs\u2014 \n Friends who far off do live are never friends. \n For how can it be anything but nonsense that friendship should depend on\n place and not on disposition? Therefore we find in Homer, that after the cup had\n gone round, \n Then the old man his counsels first disclosed; \n \n but among people who did not regulate their banquets in an orderly manner\n we read\u2014 \n Then first the flatterer rose with mocking speech. \n Besides, Homer introduces guests differing in ages and tastes, such as\n Nestor, Ulysses, and Ajax, who are all invited together. And speaking in general\n terms he represents all who lay claim to any sort of eminence as invited, and\n individually those who arrive at it by different roads. But Epicuus has\n represented all his guests as believers in the atonic theory, \n and this, too, though he had models both in the variety of the banquets of the\n great poet, and also in the elegant accounts of Plato and Xenophon; of whom Plato\n has introduced Eryximachus the physician, and Aristophanes the poet, and other\n professors of different branches of science, discussing matters of weight: and\n Xenophon has mingled with them some private individuals. \n Homer therefore has done much the best of all, and has given us by far the best\n banquets; and that again is best seen by comparing him with others. For the\n banquet of the suitors in Homer is just such as might be expected from young men\n devoted to drinking and love; and that of the Ph\u00e6acians is more orderly, but still\n luxurious. And he has made a wide distinction between these entertainments and\n those which may be called military banquets, and those which have reference to\n political affairs and are conducted in a well-regulated manner: and again he has\n distinguished between public and family banquets. But Epicurus has described a\n banquet consisting of philosophers alone. \n ","3":"\n Homer, too, has pointed out whom one ought not to invite, but who ought to\n consider that they have a right to come uninvited, showing by the presence of one\n of the relations that those in similar circumstances had a right to be present\u2014\n \n Unbidden there the brave Atrides came. \n \n For it is plain that one ought not to send a formal invitation to one's\n brother, or to one's parents, or to one's wife, or to any one else whom one can\n possibly regard in the same light as these relations, for that would be a cold and\n unfriendly proceeding. And some one has written an additional line, adding the\n reason why Menelaus had no invitation sent him, and yet came\u2014 \n For well he knew how busy was his brother: \n as if there had been any need of alleging a reason why his brother should\n come of his own accord to a banquet without any invitation,\u2014a very sufficient\n reason having been already given. For, said the interpolater of\n this line, did he not know that his brother was giving a banquet? And how\n can it be otherwise than absurd to pretend that he did not know it, when his\n sacrifice of oxen was notorious and visible to every one? And how could he have\n come if he had not known it Or, by Jove, when he saw\n him, he continues, occupied with business, was it not quite\n right of him to excuse his not having sent him an invitation, and to come of\n his own accord? As if he were to say that he came uninvited in order\n that the next day they might not look at one another, the one with feelings of\n mortification, ad the other of annoyance. \n But it would be an absurd thing to suppose that Menelaus forgot his brother, and\n this, too, when he was not only sacrificing on his account at the present moment,\n but when it was on his account that he had undertaken the whole war, and when he\n had invited those who were no relations of his, and who had no connexion even with\n his country. But Athenocles the Cyzicene, understanding the poems of Homer better\n than Aristarchus did, speaks in a much more sensible manner to us, and says that\n Homer omitted to mention Menelaus as having been invited because he was more\n nearly related to Agamemnon than the others. But Demetrius Phalereus having\n asserted that interpolated verse to be a bungling and unseasonable addition, quite\n unsuited to the poetry of Homer,\u2014-the verse, I mean, \n For well he knew how busy was his brother, \n says that he is accusing him of very ungentlemanly manners. For I\n think, says he, that every well-bred man has relations and\n friends to whom he may go, when they are celebrating any sacrifice, without\n waiting for them to send him an invitation. \n \n ","4":"\n And Plato in his Banquet speaks in the same manner on this subject.\n For, says he, that we may destroy the proverb by altering\n it: Good men may go of their own accord to feasts given by good men. For Homer\n appears not only to have destroyed that proverb, but also to have ridiculed it;\n for having represented Agamemnon as valiant in warlike matters, and Menelaus as\n an effeminate warrior, when Agamemnon celebrates a sacrifice, he represents\n Menelaus as coming uninvited,\u2014that is, the worse man coming to the feast of the\n better man. And Bacchylides, speaking of Hercules, and telling how he\n came to the house of Ceyx, says\u2014 \n Then on the brazen threshold firm he stood, \n (They were a feast preparing,) and thus spake \n Brave and just men do uninvited come \n To well-appointed feasts by brave and just men made \n \n And as to proverbs, one says\u2014 \n Good men do of their own accord \n To good men's entertainments come: \n and another says\u2014 \n Brave men do of their own accord \n To cowards' entertainments come. \n It was without reason, therefore, that Plato thought that Menelaus was a\n coward; for Homer speaks of him as Mars-loving, and as fighting single-handed with\n the greatest gallantry in defence of Patroclus, and eager to fight in single\n combat with Hector as the champion of the whole army, although he certainly was\n inferior to Hector in personal strength. And he is the only man in the whole\n expedition of whom he has said\u2014 \n And on he went, firm in his fearless zeal. \n \n \n \n But if an enemy, disparaging him, called him an effeminate warrior, and on this\n account Plato thinks that he really was an effeminate warrior, why should he not\n also class Agamemnon himself among the men void of prowess, since this line is\n spoken against him?\u2014 \n O monster, mix'd of insolence and fear, \n Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer! \n When wert thou known in ambush'd fights to dare, \n Or nobly face the horrid front of war? \n 'Tis ours the chance of fighting fields to try, \n Thine to look on and bid the valiant die. \n \n \n \n For it does not follow because something is said in Homer, that Homer himself says\n it. For how could Menelaus have been effeminate who, single-handed, kept Hector\n away from Patroclus, and who slew Euphorbus, and stripped him of his arms though\n in the very middle of the Trojan host? And it was foolish of him not completely to\n consider the entire line which he was finding fault with, in which Menelaus is\n called Raising the battle cry, \n \u03b2\u03bf\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2, for that is an epithet which Homer is\n in the habit of giving only to the most valiant; for the ancients called war\n itself \u03b2\u03bf\u03ae. \n \n ","5":"\n But Homer, who is most accurate in everything, did not overlook even this trifling\n point; that a man ought to show some care of his person, and to bathe himself\n before going to an entertainment. And so, in the case of Ulysses, before the\n banquet among the Ph\u00e6acians, he tells us\u2014 \n \n A train attends \n Around the baths, the bath the king ascends, \n (Untasted joy since that disastrous hour \n He sail'd defeated from Calypso's bower,) \n He bathes, the damsels with officious toil \n Shed sweets, shed unguents in a shower of oil. \n Then o'er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads, \n And to the feast magnificently treads. \n \n And again he says of Telemachus and his companion\u2014 \n From room to room their eager view they bend, \n Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend. \n \n For it was unseemly, says Aristotle, for a man to come to a banquet all\n over sweat and dust. For a well-bred man ought not to be dirty nor squalid, nor to\n be all over mud, as Heraclitus says. And a man when he first enters another\n person's house for a feast, ought not to hasten at once to the banqueting-room, as\n if he had no care but to fill his stomach, but he ought first to indulge his fancy\n in looking about him, and to examine the house. And the poet has not omitted to\n take notice of this also. \n Part in a portico, profusely graced \n With rich magnificence, the chariot placed; \n Then to the dome the friendly pair invite, \n Who eye the dazzling roof with vast delight, \n Resplendent as the blaze of summer noon, \n Or the pale radiance of the midnight moon. \n \n \n \n And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, represents the rustic and litigious old man as\n invited to a more civilized form of life by his son\u2014 \n Cease; sit down here and learn at length to be \n A boon companion, and a cheerful guest. \n \n And then showing him how he ought to sit down he says\u2014 \n Then praise some of these beauteous works in brass, \n Look at the roof, admire the carv\u00e8d hall. \n \n \n ","6":"\n And again Homer instructs us as to what we ought to do before a banquet, namely\n how we ought to allot the first-fruits of the dishes to the gods. At all events\n Ulysse and his friends, although in the cave of the Cyclops\u2014 \n Then first a fire we kindle, and prepare \n For his return with sacrifice and prayer. \n \n And Achilles, although the ambassadors were impatient, as they had\n arrived in the middle of the night, still\u2014 \n \n Himself opposed t' Ulysses full in sight \n Each portion parts, and orders every rite; \n The first fat offerings to th' Immortals due, \n Amid the greedy flames Patroclus threw. \n And also he introduces the guests as making libations\u2014 \n He said, and all approved; the heralds bring \n The cleansing water from the living spring, \n The youths with wine the sacred goblets crown'd, \n And large libations drench'd the sand around. \n The rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay, \n Then from the royal tent they take their way. \n \n And this ceremony Plato also observes in his Banquet. For he\n says\u2014 Then after they had supped and made libations, they sang p\u00e6ans to\n the god with all customary honours. And Xenophon speaks in very nearly\n the same terms. But in Epicurus there is no mention of any libation to the gods,\n or of any offering of first-fruits. But as Simonides says of an immodest woman\u2014\n \n And oftentimes she eats unhallow'd victims. \n \n \n ","7":"\n He says too that the Athenians were taught the proper proportions in which wine\n should be mixed by Amphictyon when he was king; and that on this account he\n erected a temple to the Upright Bacchus. For he is then really upright and not\n likely to fall, when he is drunk in proper proportions and well mixed; as Homer\n has it\u2014 \n Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace,\u2014 \n 'Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place. \n And wine can of their wits the wise beguile, \n Make the sage frolic and the serious smile; \n The grave in merry measures frisk about, \n And many a long-repented word bring out. \n \n For Homer does not call wine \u1f20\u03bb\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 in the\n sense of \u1f20\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, that is to say, foolish and the\n cause of folly. Nor does he bid a man be of a sullen countenance, neither singing\n nor laughing, nor ever turning himself to cheerful dancing in time to music. He is\n not so morose or ill-bred. But he knew the exact proportions in which all these\n things should be done, and the proper qualities and quantities of wine to be\n mixed. On which account he did not say that wine makes the sage sing, but sing\n very much, that is to say, out of tune and excessively, so as to trouble people.\n Nor, by Jove, did he say simply to smile, and to frisk about; but using the word merry, and applying that to both, he reproves the un-\n manly propensity to such trifling\u2014 \n Makes . . . . . . . . \n The grave in merry measure frisk about, \n And many a long-repented word bring out. \n But in Plato none of these things are done in a moderate manner. But men\n drink in such quantities that they cannot even stand on their feet. For just look\n at the reveller Alcibiades, how unbecomingly he behaves. And all the rest drink a\n large goblet holding eight cotyl\u00e6, using as an excuse that Alcibiades has led them\n on; not like the men in Homer\u2014 \n But when they drank, and satisfied their soul. \n Now of these things some ought to be repudiated once for all; but some\n ought to be enjoyed in moderation; people looking at them as at a slight addition\n or appendage to a repast; as Homer has said\u2014 \n Let these, my friend, \n With song and dance the pompous revel end. \n \n \n ","8":"\n And altogether the poet has attributed devotion to such things to the Suitors, and\n to the Ph\u00e6acians, but not to Nestor or to Menelaus. And Aristarchus did not\n perceive that in his marriage feast, after the entertainment had lasted some time,\n and the principal days of the revel were over, in which the bride had been taken\n to the house of the bridegroom, and the marriage of Megapenthes was completed,\n Menelaus and Helen were left to themselves and feasted together. He, I say, not\n perceiving this, but being deceived by the first line\u2014 \n Where sate Atrides 'midst his bridal friends, \n he then added these lines, which do not properly belong to this place\u2014\n \n While this gay friendly troop the king surround, \n With festival and mirth the roofs resound; \n A bard amid the joyous circle sings \n High airs, attemper'd to the vocal strings, \n Whilst, warbling to the varied strain, advance \n Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance:\u2014 \n transferring them with the error in the reading and all from the\n eighteenth book of the Iliad, where he relates the making of the arms of Achilles;\n for it ought to be red not \u1f10\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \n the dancers beginning, but ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n \u1fa0\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6, that is to say,) when the poet began to\n sing. For the word \n \u1f10\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 has peculiar reference to preluding on the\n lyre. On which account Hesiod also says in his Shield of Hercules\u2014 \n The holy goddesses, the Muses nine, \n Preluded ( \u1f10\u03be\u1fc6\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd ) with a sacred\n melody. \n \n And Archilochus says\u2014 \n Himself preluding ( \u1f10\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd ) with a sacred\n paean \n Set to the Lesbian flute. \n And Stesichorus calls the Muse the Beginner of Song ( \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ). And Pindar calls Preludes the Leaders of\n the Dance. And Diodorus the Aristophanian enclosed the whole account of the\n wedding in brackets; thinking that the first days only were alluded to, and\n disregarding the termination and what came after the banquet. And then he says we\n ought to write the words \u03b4\u03bf\u03af\u03c9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u02bc\n \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 with an aspirate, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u02bc \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, \n but that would be a solecism. For \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u02bc \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 is\n equivalent to \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, but to say\n \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 would be a solecism. \n ","9":"\n But, as I said before, the introduction of this kind of music into this modest\n kind of entertainment is transferred to this place from the Cretic dance, of which\n he says in the eighteenth book of the Iliad, about the Making of the Arms\u2014 \n A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen \n In lofty Cnossus, for the Cretan queen \n Form'd by D\u00e6dalean art; a comely band \n Of youths and maidens bounding hand-in-hand; \n The maids in soft cymars of linen dress'd, \n The youths all graceful in the glossy vest. \n Of those the locks with flow'ry wreaths enroll'd, \n Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold, \n That glittering gay from silver belts depend. \n \n And then he adds to this\u2014 \n Now all at once they rise, at once descend, \n With well-taught feet; now shape in oblique ways \n Confus'dly regular the moving maze. \n Now forth at once too swift for sight they spring, \n And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring. \n \n \n Now among the Cretans, dancing and posture-making was a national amusement. On\n which account Aeneas says to the Cretan Meriones\u2014 \n Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries), \n And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize, \n My spear, the destined passage had it found, \n Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground. \n \n \n And from this they call the hyporchemata Cretan \n They call it all a Cretan air . . . . \n The instrument is called Molossian . . . . \n \n \n \n But they who were called Laconist\u00e6, says Tim\u00e6us, used to sing\n standing to dance in square figures.\" And altogether there were many various kinds\n of music among the Greeks: as the Athenians preferred the Dionysiac and the\n Cyclian dances; and the Syracusians the Iambistic figure; and different nations\n practised different styles. \n But Aristarchus not only interpolated lines which had no business there into the\n banquet of Menelaus, and by so doing made Homer make representations inconsistent\n with the system of the Laced\u00e6monians, and with the moderation of their king, but\n he also took away the singer from the Cretan chorus, mutilating his song in the\n following manner:\u2014 \n The gazing multitudes admire around \n Two active tumblers in the centre bound; \n Now high, now low their pliant limbs they bend, \n And general songs the sprightly revel end. \n \n So that blunder of his in using the word \u1f10\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 is almost irremediable, as the relation cannot after that\n possibly be brought back so as to refer to the singer. \n ","10":"\n And it is not probable that there were any musical entertainments at Menelaus's\n banquet, as is manifest from the fact of the whole time of the banquet being\n occupied by the guests in conversation with one another; and that there is no name\n mentioned as that of the minstrel; nor is any lay mentioned which he sang; nor is\n it said that Telemachus and his party listened to him; but they rather\n contemplated the house in silence, as it were, and perfect quiet. And how can it\n be looked upon as anything but incredible, that the sons of those wisest of men,\n Ulysses and Nestor, should be introduced as such ignorant people as, like clowns,\n not to pay the least attention to carefully prepared music? At all events Ulysses\n himself attends to the Ph\u00e6acian minstrels:\u2014 \n Ulysses gazed, astonish'd to survey \n The glancing splendours as their sandals play:\u2014 \n \n although he had plenty of things to distract his attention, and although\n he could say\u2014 \n Now care surrounds me, and my force decays, \n Inured a melancholy part to bear, \n In scenes of death by tempest and by war. \n \n \n How then can we think Telemachus any better than a mere\n clown, when a minstrel and a dancer are present, if he had bent silently towards\n Pisistratus and gazed on nothing but the plate and furniture? But Homer, like a\n good painter, makes Telemachus in every respect like his father; and so he has\n made each of them easily recognised, the one by Alcinous, and the other by\n Menelaus, by means of their tears. \n ","11":"\n But in the banquet of Epicurus there is an assembly of flatterers praising one\n another. And Plato's banquet is full of mockers, cavilling at one another; for I\n say nothing of the digression about Alcibiades But in Homer it is only banquets\n conducted with moderation which are applauded; and on one occasion, a man\n addressing Menelaus says\u2014 \n I dare not in your presence speak, \n Whose voice we reverence as a voice divine. \n \n But he was reproving something which was either not said or not done with\n perfect correctness\u2014 \n And now if aught there is that can be done, \n Take my advice; I grief untimely shun \n That interrupts the feast. \n \n And again, he says\u2014 \n O son of wise Ulysses, what a word \n Has 'scaped thy ivory fence!. . . . \n For it is not right for a man to be a flatterer, nor a mocker. \n Again, Epicurus, in his banquet, inquires about indigestion, so as to draw an omen\n from the answer: and immediately after that he inquires about fevers; for why need\n I speak of the general want of rhythm and elegance which pervades the whole essay?\n But Plato, (I say nothing about his having been harassed by a cough, and about his\n taking care of himself with constant gargling of water, and also by inserting a\n straw, in order that he might excite his nose so as to sneeze; for his object was\n to turn things into ridicule and to disparage them,) Plato, I say, turns into\n ridicule the equalized sentences and the antitheses of Agathon, and introduces\n Alcibiades, saying that he is in a state of excitement. But still those men who\n write in this manner, propose to expel Homer from their cities. But, says\n Demochares, A spear is not made of a stalk of savory, nor is a good\n man made so by such discourses as these; and not only does he disparage Alcibiades, but he also runs down Charmides, and Euthyde- mus,\n and many others of the young men. And this is the conduct of a man ridiculing the\n whole city of the Athenians, the Museum of Greece, which Pindar styled The Bulwark\n of Greece; and Thucydides, in his Epigram address d to Euripides, The Greece of\n Greece; and the priest at De phi termed it, The Hearth and Prytaneum of the\n Greeks. And that he spoke falsely of the young men one may perceive from Plato\n himself, for he says that Alcibiades, (in the dialogue to which he has prefixed\n his name,) when he arrived at man's estate, then first began to converse with\n Socrates, when every one else who was devoted to the pleasures of the body fell\n off from him. But he says this at the very beginning of the dialogue. And how he\n contradicts himself in the Charmides any one who pleases may see in the dialogue\n itself. For he represents Socrates as subject to a most unseemly giddiness, and as\n absolutely intoxicated with a passion for Alcibiades, and as becoming beside\n himself, and yielding like a kid to the impetuosity of a lion; and at the same\n time he says that he disregarded his beauty. \n ","12":"\n But also the banquet of Xenophon, although it is much extolled, gives one as many\n handles to blame it as the other. For Callias assembles a banqueting party because\n his favourite Autolycus has been crowned at the Panathen\u00e6a for a victory gained in\n the Pancratium. And as soon as they are assembled the guests devote their\n attention to the boy; and this too while his father is sitting by. For as\n when light appears in the night season it attracts the eyes of every one, so\n does the beauty of Autolycus attract the eyes of everybody to itself. And then\n there was no one present who did not feel something in his heart because of\n him; but some were more silent than others, and some betrayed their feelings by\n their gestures. But Homer has never ventured to say anything of that\n sort, not even when he represents Helen as present; concerning whose beauty though\n one of those who sat opposite to her did speak, all he said, being overcome by the\n truth, was this\u2014 \n Sure 'tis no wonder such celestial charms \n For nine long years have set the world in arms. \n What winning graces, what majestic mien- \n She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen! \n \n \n And then he adds\u2014 \n Yet hence, O heaven, convey that fatal face; \n And from destruction save the Trojan race. \n But the young men who had come to Menelaus's court, the son of Nestor and\n Telemachus, when over their wine, and celebrating a wedding feast, and though\n Helen was sitting by, kept quite quiet in a decorous manner, being struck dumb by\n her renowned beauty. But why did Socrates, when to gratify some one or other he\n had tolerated some female flute-players, and some boy dancing and playing on the\n harp, and also some women tumbling and posture-making in an unseemly manner,\n refuse perfumes? For no one would have been able to restrain his laughter at him,\n recollecting these lines\u2014 \n You speak of those pale-faced and shoeless men, \n Such as that wretched Socrates and Ch\u00e6rephon. \n And what followed after was very inconsistent with his austerity. For\n Critobulus, a very well-bred young man, mocks Socrates, who was aged and his\n tutor, saying he was much uglier than the Sileni; but he discusses beauty with\n him, and selecting as judges the boy and the dancing woman, makes the prize to be\n the kisses of the judges. Now what young man meeting with this writing would not\n be corrupted rather than excited to virtue? \n ","13":"\n But in Homer, in the banquet of Menelaus, they propose to one another questions as\n in ordinary conversation, and chatting with one another like fellow-citizens, they\n entertain one another and us too. Accordingly, Menelaus, when Telemachus and his\n friends come from the bath-room, and when the tables and the dishes are laid,\n invites them to partake of them, saying\u2014 \n Accept this welcome to the Spartan court; \n The waste of nature let the feast repair, \n Then your high lineage and your names declare: \u2014 \n and then he helps them to what he has before him, treating them in the\n most friendly manner\u2014 \n Ceasing, benevolent he straight assigns \n The royal portion of the choicest chines \n To each accepted friend; with grateful haste \n They share the honours of the rich repast. \n And they, eating in silence, as it becomes young men to do, converse with\n one another, leaning forwards gently, not about the food, as\n Homer tells us, nor about the maid-servants of him who had invited them, and by\n whom they had been washed, but about the riches of their entertainer\u2014 \n Soft whispering thus to Nestor's son, \n His head reclined, young Ithacus begun: \n View'st thou unmoved, O ever honour'd most, \n These prodigies of art and wondrous cost? \n Such, and not nobler, in the realms above \n Are the rich treasures in the dome of Jove. \n \n For that, according to Seleucus, is the best reading; and Aristarchus is\n wrong when he writes\u2014 \n Such is the palace of Olympian Jove. \n For they are not admiring the beauty of building alone; for how could\n there be amber, and silver, and ivory in the walls? But they spoke partly about\n the house, as where they used the expression the sounding house, \n for that is the character of large and lofty rooms; and they spoke also of the\n furniture\u2014 \n Above, beneath, around the palace shines \n The sumless treasure of exhausted mines; \n The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay, \n And studded amber darts a golden ray. \n So that it is a natural addition to say\u2014 \n Such are the treasures in the dome of Jove, \n Wondrous they are, and awe my heart doth move \n But the statement, \n Such is the palace of Olympian Jove, \n has no connexion with\u2014 \n Wondrous they are . . . . \n and it would be a pure solecism and a very unusual reading. \n ","14":"\n Besides, the word \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f74 is not adapted to a house;\n for a place which the wind blows through is what is called \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03ae. And we say that a place which receives the wind on both sides\n \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9. And so again, \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 is an instrument through which the wind passes,\n (namely, a flute,) and every figure which is stretched out straight we call\n \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2, as a stadium, or a flow of blood\u2014 \n Straightway a thick stream ( \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 ) through\n the nostrils rush'd. \n pp And we call a helmet also, when it rises up in a\n ridge out of the centre, \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2. And at Athens\n there are some sacred places called \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, which\n are mentioned by Philochorus in his ninth book. And they use the word in the\n masculine gender, \u03bf\u1f31 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, as Thucydides does\n in his fourth book; and as, in fact, all prose writers do. But the poets use it in\n the feminine gender. Carcines says in his Achilles\u2014 \n \n \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1 \u2014Into a deep ravine which\n surrounded the army. \n And Sophocles, in his Scythians, writes\u2014 \n The crags and caverns, and the deep ravines \n Along the shore ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n And therefore we ought to understand that it is used as a feminine noun\n by Eratosthenes in his Mercury\u2014 \n A deep ravine runs through ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u1f7a\u03c2\n \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd ), \n instead of \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1, just as we find\n \u03b8\u1fc6\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7, where \u03b8\u1fc6\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 is feminine. Everything of that kind then is called \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f74 or \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd ; but at\n the present day they call palaces \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76, as\n Menander does\u2014 \n To haunt palaces ( \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76 ) and princes. \n And Diphilus says\u2014 \n To haunt palaces ( \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76 ) is, it seems to\n me, \n The conduct of an exile, slave, or beggar. \n And they got this name from having large spaces in front of their\n buildings exposed to the open air, or else, because the guards of the palace were\n stationed, and took their rest in the open air. But Homer always classes the\n \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f74 among the places exposed to the air, where\n the altar of Jupiter Herceus stood. And so Peleus is found\u2014 \n I and Ulysses touch'd at Peleus port; \n There, in the centre of his grassy court, \n A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice, \n And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs. \n And so Priam lay:\u2014 \n In the court-yard amid the dirt he roll'd. \n \n And Ulysses says to Phemius\u2014 \n Thou with the heav'n-taught bard in peace resort, \n From blood and carnage, to yon open court. \n \n But that Telemachus was praising not only the house, but also the riches\n which it contained, is made plain by the reply of Menelaus\u2014 \n \n My wars, the copious theme of ev'ry tongue, \n To you your fathers have recorded long; \n How favouring Heav'n repaid my glorious toils \n With a sack'd palace and barbaric spoils. \n \n \n \n ","15":"\n But we must return back to the banquet, in which Homer very ingeniously devises a\n subject for conversation, by comparing the acquisition of riches with that of a\n friend. For he does not put it forward as a grave proposition for discussion, but\n Menelaus inserts it in his conversation very gracefully, after he has heard them\n praise himself and his good fortune; not denying that he is rich, but from that\n very circumstance deprecating envy, for he says that he has acquired those riches\n so that, \n When my woes are weigh'd, \n Envy will own the purchase dearly paid. \n \n He does not indeed think it right to compare himself with the gods\u2014\n \n The monarch took the word, and grave replied\u2014 \n Presumptuous are the vaunts, and vain the pride \n Of man who dares in pomp with Jove contest, \n Unchanged, immortal, and supremely blest. \n But then, after displaying his affectionate disposition as a brother, and\n saying that he is compelled to live and to be rich, he opposes to this the\n consideration of friendship\u2014 \n Oh, had the gods so large a boon denied, \n And life, the just equivalent, supplied \n To those brave warriors who, with glory fired, \n Far from their country in my cause expired. \n Who could there be then of the descendants of those men who had died in\n his cause, who would not think his grief for the death of his father as fair a\n compensation as could be given by grateful recollection? But still, that he may\n not appear to look upon them all in the same light, though they had all equally\n shown their good-will to him, he adds\u2014 \n But oh! Ulysses,\u2014deeper than the rest, \n That sad idea wounds my anxious breast; \n My heart bleeds fresh with agonising pain, \n The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain. \n And that he may not seem to disregard any one of his family he names them\n all separately\u2014 \n Doubtful of his doom, \n His good old sire with sorrow to the tomb \n \n Declines his trembling steps; untimely care \n Withers the blooming vigour of his heir; \n And the chaste partner of his bed and throne \n Wastes all her widow'd hours in tender moan. \n And while he is weeping at the recollection of his father, Menelaus\n observes him; and, in the interim, Helen had come in, and she also conjectured who\n Telemachus was from his likeness to Ulysses, (for women, because of their habit of\n observing one another's modesty, are wonderfully clever at detecting the likeness\n of children to their parents,) and after Pisistratus had interfered with some\n observation, (for it was not fitting for him to stand by like a mute on the\n stage,) and said something appropriate and elegant about the modesty of\n Telemachus; again Menelaus made mention of his affection for Ulysses, that of all\n men in the world he was the one in whose companionship he wished to grow old. \n ","16":"\n And then, as is natural, they all weep; and Helen, as being the daughter of\n Jupiter, and as having learnt of the philosophers in Egypt many expedients of all\n kinds, pours into some wine a medicinal panacea, as it was in reality; and begins\n to relate some of the exploits of Ulysses, while working at her loom in the\n meantime; not doing this so much for the purpose of amusement, as because she had\n been bred up in that way at home. And so Venus, coming to her after the single\n combat in the Iliad, takes a form not her own\u2014 \n To her beset with Trojan beauties, came \n In borrow'd form the laughter-loving dame. \n She seem'd an ancient maid, well skill'd to cull \n The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool. \n \n And her industry is made manifest not in a merely cursory manner, in the\n following description\u2014 \n In this suspense bright Helen graced the room; \n Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume; \n The seat of majesty Adraste brings, \n With art illustrious for the pomp of kings; \n To spread the pall, beneath the regal chair, \n Of softest woof, is bright Alcippe's care; \n A silver canister, divinely wrought, \n In her soft hands the beauteous Philo brought; \n To Sparta's queen of old the radiant vase \n Alcandra gave, a pledge of royal grace, \n \n \n Sharer of Polybus's high command, \n She gave the distaff too to Helen's hand, \n And that rich vase with living sculpture wrought, \n Which, heap'd with wool, the beauteous Philo brought; \n The silken fleece, impurpled for the loom, \n Rivall'd the hyacinth in vernal bloom. \n And she seems to be aware of her own proficiency in the art: at all\n events, when she presents Telemachus with arobe, she says\u2014 \n Accept, dear youth, this monument of love, \n Long since, in better days, by Helen wove. \n Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay, \n To deck thy bride, and grace thy nuptial day. \n \n And that fondness for employment proves her temperance and modesty. For\n she is never represented as luxurious or arrogant, because of her beauty.\n Accordingly, she is found at her loom weaving and embroidering\u2014 \n Her in the palace at the loom she found, \n The golden web her own sad story crown'd; \n The Trojan wars she weaved, (herself the prize,) \n And the dire triumph of her fatal eyes. \n \n \n \n ","17":"\n And Homer teaches us that those who have been invited to a feast, ought to ask\n leave of their entertainers before they rise up to depart. And so Telemachus does\n to Menelaus\u2014 \n But now let sleep the painful waste repair, \n Of sad reflection and corroding care. \n \n And Minerva, when pretending to be Mentor, says to Nestor\u2014 \n Now immolate the tongues and mix the wine, \n Sacred to Neptune and the pow'rs divine: \n The lamp of day is quench'd beneath the deep, \n And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep; \n Nor fits it to prolong the heav'nly feast, \n Timeless, indecent; but retire to rest. \n \n And in the feasts of the gods it does not appear to have been considered\n proper to remain too long at the table. Accordingly, Minerva says, very\n sententiously, in Homer\u2014 \n For now has darkness quench'd the solar light, \n And it becomes not gods to feast by night. \n And now there is a law in existence that there are some sacrificial\n feasts from which men must depart before sunset. And among the Egyptians formerly\n every kind of banquet was conducted with great moderation; as Apollonis has said,\n who wrote a treatise on the feasts of the Egyptian; for they\n ate in a sitting posture, using the very simplest and most wholesome food; and\n only just as much wine as was calculated to put them in cheerful spirits, which is\n what Pindar entreats of Jupiter\u2014 \n Oh mighty thund'ring Jove! \n Great Saturn's son, lord of the realms above, \n That I may be to thee and the nine Muses dear, \n That joy my heart may cheer; \n This is my prayer, my only prayer to thee. \n But the banquet of Plato is not an assembly of grave men, nor a\n conversazione of philosophers. For Socrates does not choose to depart from the\n banquet, although Eryximachus, and Ph\u00e6drus, and some others, have already left it;\n but he stays till a late hour with Agathon and Aristophanes, and drinks from the\n silver well; for fairly has some one given this name to large cups. And he drinks\n out of the bowl cleverly, like a man who is used to it. And Plato says, that after\n this those two others began to nod, and that first of all Aristophanes fell\n asleep, and when day began to break so did Agathon; and that Socrates, after he\n had sent them both to sleep, rose up from table himself and went away to the\n Lyceum, when he might, says Herodicus, have gone to Homer's L\u00e6strygones\u2014 \n Where he who scorns the chains of sleep to wear, \n And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care, \n His double toils may claim a double pay, \n And join the labours of the night and day. \n \n \n \n ","18":"\n But every banqueting party among the ancients was referred to the gods; and\n accordingly men wore garlands appropriate and peculiar to the gods, and used hymns\n and odes. And there were no slaves to attend upon the guests, but free youths\n acted as the cupbearers. So the son of M\u00e6nelaus, although he was the bridegroom,\n and at his own wedding, acted; and in the poem of the beautiful Sappho, even\n Mercury acts as the cupbearer to the gods. And they were free men who prepared\n everything else for the guests. And after they had supped they went away while it\n was still daylight. But at some of the Persian feasts there were also councils\n held, as there were in the tent of Agamemnon with respect to the further conduct\n of the Trojan war. Now as to the entertainment given by Alcinous, to which the\n discourse of Ulysses refers where he says\u2014 \n \n How goodly seems it ever to employ \n Man's social days in union and in joy; \n The plenteous board high heap'd with cates diviner \n And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine; \n The heav'n-taught poet and enchanting strain, \n These are the products of a peaceful reign. \n He refers also especially to his reception of straners, since the\n Ph\u00e6acians themselves were devoted to luxury and yet if any one compares that feast\n made by Alcinous with the banquets of the philosophers, he will find that the\n better regulated of the two; although that also embraced much cheerfulness and\n spirit, only not in any unbecoming manner. For after the exhibition of gymnastics\n the bard sings\u2014 \n The loves of Mars, \n a certain lay mingled with some ridiculous incidents, and one which\n suggested to Ulysses some hints for the slaughter of the suitors; since Vulcan,\n even though he was lame, got the better of the most valiant Mars. \n ","19":"\n And the feasters of that time sat at the table; at all events, Homer very often\n says\u2014 \n Sitting in order on the chairs and couches. \n For the word \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, which he uses in\n this line, when taken by itself, is a seat such as is used by free men, with a\n footstool, the name of which being \u03b8\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd\u03c5\u03c2, from\n thence they came to call the seat itself \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \n from the verb \u03b8\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, which they used for, to\n sit; as Philetas says\u2014 \n To sit ( \u03b8\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) on the ground under a\n plane-tree. \n But the couch ( \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 ) was more adapted\n for reclining on; and the \u03b4\u03af\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is something\n simpler than these things. Accordingly, in the book where Ulysses appears as a\n beggar the servants place for him, as Homer tells us, \n A humble chair ( \u03b4\u03af\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ), and spread a scanty\n board. \n But their goblets, as their name ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 ) indicates, were supplied full of wine mixed with water\n ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ); and the youths ministered to them\n from the larger goblets, always, in the case of the most honourable of the guests,\n keeping their small cups full; but to the rest they distributed the wine in equal\n portions. Accordingly Agamemnon says to Idomeneus\u2014 \n To thee the foremost honours are decreed, \n First in the fight, and every graceful deed; \n \n \n \n For this in banquets, when the generous bowls \n Restore our blood, and raise our warrior souls, \n Though all the rest with stated rules are bound, \n Unmix'd, unmeasured are thy goblets crown'd. \n And they used to pledge one another, not as we do, (for our custom may be\n expressed by the verb \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 rather than by\n \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9, ) but they drank the entire bumper off\u2014\n \n He fill'd his cup, and pledged great Peleus' son. \n And how often they took meat, we have already explained \u2014namely, that\n they had three meals, because it is the same meal that was at one time called\n \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, and at another \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd. For those men who say that they used to take four meals a\n day, are ridiculously ignorant, since the poet himself says\u2014 \n But do thou come \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2. \n \n And these men do not perceive that this word means, after having\n remained here till evening. But, nevertheless, no one can show in the\n poet one instance of any one taking food even three times in the day. But many men\n are led into mistakes, placing these verses in the poet all together\u2014 \n They wash; the tables in fair order spread, \n They heap the glittering canisters with bread, \n Viands of various kinds allure the taste, \n Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast. \n \n For if the housekeeper placed the meats on the table, it is plain that\n there was no need for the carver to bring in more, so that some of the above\n description is superfluous. But when the guests had departed the tables were\n removed, as is done at the feasts of the Suitors and of the Ph\u00e6acians, in whose\n case he says\u2014 \n The servants bore away the armour of the feast. \n And it is plain that he means the dishes, for the word he uses is\n \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b1 ; and it is that part of the armour which\n covers a man, such as his breastplate, his greaves, and things like them which men\n call \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b1, as being in front ( \u1f04\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 ) of the parts of the body. And of the rooms in the\n palaces of the heroes, those which were larger Homer calls, \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1, and \u03b4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, and even\n \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (tents). But the moderns call them\n \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 (rooms to receive men) and \u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 (strangers' apartments). \n ","20":"\n What then, my friends, shall we call the entertainment which Antiochus, who was\n surnamed Epiphanes, (but who was more rightly called Epimanes from his actions,) gave Now he was king of the Syrians, being one of the Seleucid\u00e6. And Polybius says\n of him, \"He, escaping out of the palace without the knowledge of the attendants,\n was often found with one or two companions wandering about the city wherever he\n might chance to take it into his head to go. And he was, above all other places,\n frequently found at the shops of the engravers of silver and of the goldsmiths,\n conversing on the subject of their inventions with, and inquiring into the\n principles of their art from, the engravers and other artists. And besides this,\n he often used to go among the common people, conversing with whomsoever he might\n chance to meet; and he would drink with the lowest and poorest strangers. And\n whenever he heard of any young men having a banquet, without having given any\n notice of his intention, he would come to join in their feast with a flute and\n music, behaving in a most lascivious manner; so that many used to rise up and\n depart, being alarmed at his strange behaviour. Often, also, he would lay aside\n his royal robes, and put on a common cloak, and so go round the market, like a man\n who was a candidate for some office: and taking some people by the hand, and\n embracing others, he would solicit them to vote for him, sometimes begging to be\n made \u00e6dile, and sometimes tribune; and when he was elected, sitting in his ivory\n curule chair, according to the fashion which prevails among the Romans, he would\n hear all the causes which were pleaded in the forum, and decide them with great\n attention and earnestness, by which conduct he greatly perplexed sensible men, For\n some thought him a man of very simple tastes, and others considered him mad. And\n his conduct with respect to presents was very much the same. For he would give\n some people dice of antelope's bones, and some he would present with dates, and to\n others he would give gold. And even if he met people in the street whom he had\n never seen, he would give them presents unexpectedly. And in his sacrifices, which\n were offered up in the different cities, and in the honours offered to the gods,\n he surpassed all the kings who had ever existed. And any one may conjecture his\n from the temple raised to Olympian Jupiter at Athens, and from the statues around\n the altar at Delos. And he used to bathe in the public baths, often when they were\n complete y full of the citizens, and then he would have earthen pairs of the most expensive perfumes brought to him. And on one of these\n occasions, when some one said to him, Happy are you kings, who use all\n these things and smell so sweet, he made the man no answer at the time;\n but coming the next day to the place where he was bathing, he caused him to have a\n pan of the largest size of that most precious ointment called \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1f74 poured over his head, so that when that had been\n done, every one near got up and hastened to get a little of the ointment, and as\n they fell down in their haste, by reason of the slipperiness of the floor, every\n one laughed, as did the king himself. \n ","21":"\n \n And this same king, continues Polybius, \"having heard of the games\n which had been celebrated in Macedonia by Aemilius Paullus the Roman general,\n wishing to surpass Paullus in his magnificence and liberality, sent ambassadors\n and theori to the different cities to proclaim that games were going to be\n exhibited by him at Daphne, so that the Greeks all hastened with great eagerness\n to come to him to see them. And the beginning of the exhibition was a splendid\n procession, arranged in this way:\u2014Some men led the way armed in the Roman fashion,\n in breastplates of chain armour, all men in the flower of their youth, to the\n number of five thousand; immediately after them, five thousand Mysians followed;\n and then three thousand Cilicians, armed in the fashion of light-armed\n skirmishers, having golden crowns; and after them three thousand Thracians and\n five thousand Galatians; these were followed by twenty thousand Macedonians, and\n by five thousand men armed with brazen shields, and as many more with silver\n shields; they were followed by two hundred and forty pair of gladiators to fight\n in single combat; behind these came a thousand Nis\u00e6an cavalry, and three thousand\n men of the city guard, the greatest part of whom had golden trappings and golden\n crowns, but some had silver trappings; to these succeeded the cavalry who are\n called the King's Companions; these amounted to one thousand men, all equipped\n with golden trappings; next to these was the battalion of the King's Friends, of\n the same number and the same equipment; after these a thousand picked men; and\n they were followed by what was called the Agema, which was considered to be the\n most excellent squadron of all the cavalry, to the number of \n a thousand men; last of all came the Fenced Cavalry, having its name from the fact\n that both men and horses were com- pletely enveloped in armour; they were in\n number fifteen hundred men. And all the above-mentioned soldiers had purple\n cloaks, and many had them also embroidered with gold or painted with figures of\n living animals. Besides all this, there were a hundred chariots with six horses,\n and forty with four horses; then a chariot drawn by four elephants, and another by\n two; and last of all, six-and-thirty elephants, all handsomely appointed, followed\n one by one. \n ","22":"\n \"The rest of the procession was such as it is difficult adequately to describe,\n and it must be enumerated in a summary manner. For youths walked in the procession\n to the number of eight hundred, all having golden crowns; and fat oxen to the\n number of one thousand; and deputations to see to the performance of separate\n sacrifices, very little short of three hundred; and there were eight hundred\n elephants' teeth carried by, and such a multitude of statues as it is beyond any\n one's power to enumerate. For images were carried in the procession of all who are\n ever said or thought by men to be gods, or deities, or demigods, or heroes; some\n gilt all over, and some arrayed in golden-broidered robes. And to all of them\n suitable inscriptions according to the accounts commonly received of them were\n attached, earved in the most expensive materials. And they were followed by an\n image of Night and another of Day; and of the Earth, and of Heaven, and of\n Morning, and of Noon. And the vast quantity of gold plate and silver plate was\n such as perhaps a man may form a guess at from the following account. For a\n thousand slaves belonging to Dionysius the secretary and amanuensis of the king\n joined in the procession, each carrying articles of silver plate, of which there\n was not one weighing less than a thousand drachm\u00e6. And there were six hundred\n slaves belonging to the king himself, carrying articles of gold plate. And besides\n them there were women to the number of two hundred sprinkling every one with\n perfume out of golden waterpots. And they were succeeded by eighty women\n magnificently apparelled, borne on palanquins with golden feet, and five hundred\n borne on palanquins wit silver feet. And this was the most important portion of\n the procession. \n \n ","23":"\n \n But after the games were over and the single combats and the hunting,\n during the whole thirty days which he exhibited these shows, on the first five\n days every one who came into the gymnasium was anointed with a saffron perfume\n shed upon him out of golden dishes. And there were fifteen of these golden\n dishes, full of equal quantities of cinnamon and spikenard. And in a similar\n manner in the five next days there was brought in essence of fenugreek, and of\n amaracus, and of lilies, all differing in their scent; and some days there were\n laid a thousand triclinia for the banquet; and some days fifteen hundred, all\n laid in the most expensive possible manner. And the arrangement of the whole\n business was superintended by the king himself. For having a very fine horse he\n went up and down the whole procession, commanding some to advance, and others\n to halt. And stopping at the entrances of the rooms where the drinking was\n going on he brought some in, and to others he assigned places on the couches.\n And he himself conducted in the attendants who brought in the second course.\n And he went round the whole banquet, sometimes sitting down in one place, and\n presently lying down in another place. And sometimes even while he was eating\n he would lay down what he was eating or his cup, and jump up, and go away to\n another part of the room. And he would go all round the company, at times,\n pledging some of the guests in a standing posture; and at times entertaining\n himself with the jesters or with the music. And when the entertainment had\n lasted a long time and many of the guests had gone away, then the king would be\n brought in by buffoons, all covered up, and laid on the ground as if he had\n been one of their band. And when the music excited him, he would jump up and\n dance, and act with the mummers, so that every one felt ashamed for him and\n fled away. And all this was done partly with the treasure which he brought out\n of Egypt, having plundered Ptolemy Philometor the king there, in defiance of\n his treaty with him when he was but a little boy; and some of the money too was\n contributed by his friends. And he had also sacrilegiously plundered most of\n the temples in his dominions. \n \n ","24":"\n And while all the guests marvelled at the conduct of the king, seeing that he was\n not illustrious but absolutely mad, Masurius brought forward Callixenus the\n Rhodian, who in the fourth book of his History of Alexandria\n has given an account of a spectacle and procession which was exhibited by that\n most admirable of all monarchs, Ptolemy Phiadelphus. And he says\u2014\"But before I\n begin, I will give a description of the tent which was prepared within the circuit\n of the citadel, apart from the place provided for the reception of the soldiers,\n and artisans, and foreigners. For it was wonderfully beautiful, and worth hearing\n about. Its size was such as to be able to hold a hundred and thirty couches placed\n in a circle, and it was furnished in the following manner:\u2014There were wooden\n pillars at intervals, five on each side of the tent longwise, fifty cubits high,\n and something less than one cubit broad. And on these pillars at the top was a\n capital, of square figure, carefully fitted, supporting the whole weight of the\n roof of the banqueting room. And over this was spread in the middle a scarlet veil\n with a white fringe, like a canopy; and on each side it had beams covered over\n with turreted veils, with white centres, on which canopies embroidered all over\n the centre were placed. And of the pillars four were made to resemble palm-trees,\n and they had in the centre a representation of thyrsi. And on the outside of these\n a portico ran, adorned with a peristyle on three sides, with a vaulted roof. And\n in this place it was intended that the company of the feasters should sit down.\n And the interior of it was surrounded with scarlet curtains. But in the middle of\n the space there were strange hides of beasts, strange both as to their variegated\n colour and their size, suspended. And the part which surrounded this portico in\n the open air was shaded by myrtle-trees and daphnes, and other suitable shrubs.\n And the whole floor was strewed with flowers of every description. For Egypt, on\n account of the temperate character of the atmosphere which surrounds it, and on\n account of the fondness of the inhabitants for gardening, produces in great\n abundance, and all the year round, those things which in other countries are\n rarely found, and only at particular seasons. And roses, and white lilies, and\n numberless other flowers are never wanting in that country. On which account,\n though this entertainment took place in the middle of winter, still there was a\n show of flowers which was quite incredible to the foreigners. For flowers of which\n one could not easily have found enough to make one chaplet in any other city were supplied in the greatest abundance here, to make chaplets\n for every one of the guests at this entertainment, and were strewed thickly over\n the whole floor of the tent; so as really to give the appearance of a most divine\n meadow. \n ","25":"\n \"And by the posts round the entire tent there were placed animals carved in marble\n by the first artists, a hundred in number. And in the spaces between the posts\n there were pictures hung by the Sicyonian painters; and alternately with these\n there were carefully selected images of every kind; and garments embroidered with\n gold, and most exquisite cloaks, some of them having portraits of the kings of\n Egypt embroidered on them; and some, stories taken from the mythology. Above them\n were placed gold and silver shields alternately; and on the spaces above these\n shields, which were eight cubits high, caves were made, six on each side of the\n tent longwise, and four at each end. There were likewise in them representations\n of eating parties opposite to one another, of tragic, and comic, and satyric\n animals, having on real clothes. And before them were placed golden goblets. And\n in the middle of the caves were placed nymph\u00e6a, and on them there lay golden\n Delphian tripods, having pedestals of their own. And along the highest part of the\n roof were golden eagles all facing one another, each fifteen cubits large. There\n were also golden couches, with feet made like sphinxes, on the two sides of the\n tent, a hundred on each side. For the front of the tent was left open. And under\n these there were strewed purple carpets of the finest wool, with the carpet\n pattern on both sides. And there were handsomely embroidered rugs very beautifully\n elaborated on them. Besides this, thin Persian cloths covered all the centre space\n where the guests walked, having most accurate representations of animals\n embroidered on them. And by them were placed tripods for the guests, made of gold,\n two hundred in number, so that there were two for every couch, and they rested on\n silver pedestals. And behind, out of sight, there were a hundred flat dishes of\n silver, and an equal number of lavers. On the opposite side of the sitting-room\n there was fixed another sideboard, opposite to that on which the cups and goblets\n were placed; and on that were all the rest of the things which had been prepared\n for, or could come into use. And they were all made of gold, and studded with\n precious stones; admirably carved and wrought. And it has\n appeared to me too long a task to undertake to enumerate every article of the\n furniture, and even all the different kinds separate. But the entire weight of all\n the plate and valuables there exhibited came to ten thousand talents. \n ","26":"\n \"But now that we have gone over everything that was to be seen in the tent, we\n will proceed to the shows and processions exhibited. For it passed through the\n stadium which there is in the city. And first of all went the procession of\n Lucifer. For it began at the time when that star first appears. After that came\n the procession which bore the name of the parents of the kings. And next came the\n processions sacred to all the gods respectively, each having an arrangement\n appropriate to the history of each separate deity. Last of all came the procession\n of Hesperus, as the hour of that one starting coincided with that time. But if any\n one wishes to know the separate particulars, he may take the description of the\n quinquennial games and consider them. But in the Dionysiac procession first of all\n there went the Sileni who keep off the multitude, some clad in purple cloaks, and\n some in scarlet ones. And these were followed by Satyrs, twenty in each division\n of the stadium, bearing gilded lamps made of ivy-wood. And after them came images\n of Victory, having golden wings, and they bore in their hands incense-burners six\n cubits in height, adorned with branches made of ivy-wood and gold, clad in tunics\n embroidered with figures of animals, and they themselves also had a great deal of\n golden ornament about them. And after them there followed an altar of six cubits\n in height, a double altar, covered all over with ivy-leaves gilded, having a crown\n of vine-leaves on it all gold, enveloped in bandages with white centres. And that\n was followed by boys in purple tunics, bearing frankincense, and myrrh, and\n saffron, on golden dishes. And after them came forty Satyrs, crowned with\n ivy-garlands made of gold. And they were painted as o their bodies, some with\n purple, some with vermilion, an some with other colours. And these also wore each\n a golden crown made to imitate vine-leaves and ivy-leaves. And after them came two\n Sileni in purple cloaks and white fringes to them. And one of them had a petasus\n and a golden caduceus, and the other had a trumpet. And between them went a man of\n gigantic size, four cubits high, in a tragical dress and\n orna- ments, bearing the golden horn of Amalthea. And his name was Eniautos. And he was followed\n by a woman of great beauty and of more than ordinary size, adorned with quantities\n of gold and a superb dress; bearing in one of her hands a garland of peach\n blossoms, and in her other hand a branch of the palm-tree. And she was called\n Penteteris. And\n she was succeeded by the Four Seasons dressed in character, and each of them\n bearing its appropriate fruits. Next to them came two incense-burners made of\n ivy-wood, covered with gold, and six cubits in height, and a large square golden\n altar in the middle of them. And then again Satyrs, having garlands of ivy-leaves\n made of gold, and clad in purple robes. And some of them bore golden wine-jars,\n and others bore goblets. After them marched Philiscus the poet, being a priest of\n Bacchus, and with him all the artisans who were concerned in the service of\n Bacchus. And next to them were carried the Delphian tripods, as prizes for the\n trainers of the athletes; the one for the trainer of the boys nine cubits in\n height, and the other, twelve cubits in height, for the trainer of the men. \n ","27":"\n \"After them was a four-wheeled wagon fourteen cubits long, and eight cubits wide;\n and it was drawn by a hundred and eighty men; and in it was placed an image of\n Bacchus ten cubits high, pouring libations of wine out of a golden goblet, having\n on a purple tunic reaching down to the feet; and he was clad in a purple garment\n embroidered with gold; and in front of him there lay a golden Laced\u00e6monian goblet,\n holding fifteen measures of wine, and a golden tripod, in which was a golden\n incense-burner, and two golden bowls, full of cassia and saffron; and a shade\n covered it round adorned with ivy-leaves, and vine-leaves, and all sorts of other\n green leaves; and to it were fastened chaplets, and fillets, and thyrsi, and\n drums, and turbans, and satyric and comic and tragic masks. And the wagon was\n followed by priests and priestesses, and newly initiated votaries, and by\n companies of every nation, and by people bearing the mystic fan. And after this\n came the Bacchanalian women, called Macet\u00e6, and Mimallones, and Bassar\u00e6, and\n Lydians, with dishevelled hair, and wearing garlands, some of snakes, and others\n of branches of yew and of vine-leaves and ivy-leaves, and\n some held daggers in their hands, and others held snakes. And after them another\n four-wheeled wagon was drawn of the width of eight cubits, and it was drawn by\n sixty men and in it was a statue of Nysa, of eight cubits high, in a sitting\n posture, clothed in a box-coloured tunic embroidered with gold, and it was also\n clad in a Laconian cloak; and this statue rose up by mechanism, without any one\n applying his hand to it; and it poured libations of milk out of a golden bottle,\n and then it sat down again; and in its left hand it bore a thyrsus wrapped round\n with turbans, and it was crowned with a garland of ivy-leaves, made of gold, and\n with gorgeous bunches of grapes inlaid with precious stones; and it had a parasol\n over it; and on the corners of the wagon were fastened four golden lamps. \n \"And next to that another four-wheeled wagon was drawn along, twenty cubits in\n length and sixteen in width, and it was drawn by three hundred men. And on it\n there was a wine-press twenty-four cubits in length and fifteen in breadth, full\n of grapes; and sixty Satyrs were trampling on the grapes, singing a song in praise\n of the wine-press, to the music of a flute. And Silenus presided over them; and\n the new wine ran out over the whole road. Next to that was drawn along a wagon,\n twenty-five cubits long and fourteen broad; and that was drawn by six hundred men.\n And on this wagon was a sack holding three thousand measures of wine, consisting\n of leopards' skins, sewn together. And this too allowing its liquor to escape,\n gradually flowed over the whole road. And it was followed by Satyri and Sileni, to\n the number of a hundred and twenty, all wearing garlands, and carrying some casks\n of wine, and some bowls, and some large Thericlean goblets, all made of gold. \n ","28":"\n And next to that was carried a silver vessel conaining six hundred measures of\n wine, being drawn on a four-wheeled wagon by six hundred men. Arid under its lips,\n and under its ears, and under its bottom, it had figures of animals engraved; and\n in the middle it was crowned with a golden crown, inlaid with precious stones.\n Next to that there were carried two silver goblets, twelve cubits in circumference\n and six cubits in height; and these had figures standing out in relief above, and\n also on their round parts all round And on their feet they\n had chased figures of animals two cubits and a half long and a cubit high, in\n great numbers: and ten large bathing-vessels, and sixteen ewers, of which the\n larger ones contained thirty measures, and the smaller ones five; then six\n kettles, and twenty-four banoti, on five side-boards; and two silver wine-presses, on which were\n twenty-four urns; and a table of solid silver twelve cubits round; and thirty\n other tables six cubits each in circumference: and in addition to this, four\n tripods, one of which was sixteen cubits in circumference, and was made entirely\n of silver; but the other three, which were less, were studded with precious stones\n in the middle. And after these there were carried some Delphic tripods, made of\n silver, eighty in number, smaller than those previously described, being also of a\n square, or four-cornered shape. And six-and-twenty water-cans, and sixteen\n Panathenaic jars, and a hundred and sixty wine-coolers, the largest of which\n contained six measures, and the smallest contained two; and all these were made of\n silver. \n ","29":"\n \"And next to them, those men followed in the procession who carried the articles\n of gold-plate,\u2014four Laced\u00e6monian goblets, having crowns on them made to represent\n vine-leaves, each containing four measures; and two of Corinthian workmanship\n placed on sideboards, and these had figures of animals in richly chased work of\n great beauty, in a sitting posture, and on their necks and on their bellies were\n other reliefs curiously wrought, and each of them contained eight measures. And\n there was a wine-press in which there were ten urns, and two jars, each holding\n five measures, and two flagons, each holding two measures, and twenty-two\n wine-coolers, the largest of which contained thirty measures, and the smallest one\n measure. There were also exhibited four large golden tripods, and a large\n sideboard for gold plate, that being also made of gold itself and studded with\n precious stones, ten cubits in height, having six rows of shelves in it, on which\n were figures of animals of the size of four palms, most exquisitely wrought, in\n very great numbers; and two goblets, and two crystal goblets mounted in gold; and\n four more sideboards, two of them four cubits high; and three others which were\n smaller, and ten water-cans, and an altar three cubits high, and twenty-five\n dishes for holding barley loaves. \n \n \n After this had been carried by, there walked sixteen hun- dred boys clad in\n white tunics, and crowned some with ivy, and some with pine, of whom two\n hundred and fifty carried golden choes, and four hundred carried silver ones;\n and of the rest three hundred and twenty carried golden wine-coolers, and some\n carried silver ones. And after them other boys carried jars, for the purpose of\n drinking sweet nine out of, twenty of which were gold, and fifty silver, and\n three hundred were painted with every kind of colour and hue; and all the\n spectators who were present in the stadium took a moderate draught of the sweet\n wine, which was mixed in these ewers and firkins. \n \n ","30":"\n After these things he enumerates tables four cubits high, on which were many\n things worth looking at, which were all carried round for the spectators to see,\n being beautifully wrought. \"And among them was a representation of the bed-chamber\n of Semele, in which were seen statues clad in golden tunics, inlaid with precious\n stones of the greatest value. And it would not be right to pass over this\n four-wheeled wagon, of the length of twenty-two cubits and of the breadth of\n fourteen, drawn by five hundred men. And on it was a cave exceedingly deep,\n overgrown with ivy and yew, and out of it flew doves, and pigeons, and\n turtle-doves, all along the road as the wagon proceeded, having their feet tied\n with slight threads, so as to be easily caught by the spectators. And out of the\n cave there also rose two fountains, one of milk and one of wine, and around it all\n the nymphs had garlands of gold, and Mercury had a golden herald's wand, and very\n superb raiment. And on another four-wheeled wagon, on which the return of Bacchus\n from the Indians was represented, there was a figure of Bacchus twelve cubits\n high, riding upon an elephant, clad in a purple robe, and having on a crown of\n vine-leaves and ivy-leaves o gold, and bearing in his hands a spear like a\n thyrsus, made also of gold; and he wore sandals embroidered with golden figures.\n And there sat before him, on the neck of the elephant, a Satyr five cubits in\n height, crowned with a chaplet of golden pine-leaves, and holding in his right\n hand a goat's horn made of golden, with which he appeared to be blowing signals.\n And the elephant had golden furniture; and on his neck he had a crown of\n ivy-leaves made of gold; and he was followed by five hundred\n maidens dressed in purple tunics, with golden girdles; and those who went first,\n to the number of a hundred and twenty, wore crowns of pine-leaves made of gold;\n and they were succeeded by a hundred and twenty Satyrs clad in complete armour,\n some of silver and some of brass. And after them there marched five troops of\n asses, on which rode Sileni and Satyri, all wearing crowns. And of the asses some\n had gold and some silver frontlets and furniture. \n ","31":"\n \"And after them came twenty-four chariots drawn by four elephants each, and sixty\n chariots each drawn by a pair of goats, and twelve chariots by antelopes, and\n seven by oryxes, and fifteen by buffaloes, eight by pairs of ostriches, and seven\n by gnus, and four by pairs of zebras, and four chariots also drawn each by four\n zebras. And on all these animals rode boys wearing the garments of charioteers,\n and the broad hats called petasi; and besides them were smaller boys still, armed\n with little pelt\u00e6, and thyrsi-spears, and they also were dressed in\n golden-broidered garments; and the boys who were acting as charioteers were\n crowned with pine-leaf chaplets, and the smaller boys with ivy-leaves. And besides\n this there were three pair of camels, on either side three, and they were followed\n by cars drawn by mules; and these had on them barbaric palanquins, on which sat\n women from India and other countries, habited as prisoners. And of the camels,\n some bore three hundred min\u00e6 weight of frankincense, and three hundred of myrrh,\n and two hundred of saffron, and cassia, and cinnamon, and iris, and two hundred of\n other spices. And next to them came some Aethiopians bearing presents, some of\n whom carried six hundred elephant's tusks, and others carried two thousand fagots\n of ebony, and others carried sixty gold and silver goblets, and a quantity of\n gold-dust. And after them came two huntsmen, having hunting-spears with golden\n points; and twenty-four hundred dogs were led in the procession, some Indian dogs,\n and others Hyrcanian and Molossian hounds, and hounds of other breeds too. \n \n After them came a hundred and fifty men carrying trees from which were\n suspended birds and beasts of every imaginable country and description; and\n then were carried a lot of cages, in which were parrots, and peacocks, and\n guinea-fowls, and pheasants, and other Aethiopian birds in great\n numbers. \n \n \n And when he had mentioned many other things, and enumerated herds of animals, he\n continued, \"A hundred and thirty Aethiopian sheep, three hundred Arabian sheep,\n twenty Eub\u0153ean sheep, some white hornless cattle, six-and-twenty Indian cows,\n eight Aethiopian oxen, one immense white bear, fourteen leopards, sixteen\n panthers, four lynxes, three arceti, one cameleopard, and one rhinoceros from\n Aethiopia. \n ","32":"\n \"And after these beasts came an image of Bacchus flying to the altar of Rhea when\n he was pursued by Juno, having on a golden crown, Priapus standing by him crowned\n with a crown of ivy-leaves of gold, and the statue of Juno had also a golden crown\n on its head. And there were images of Alexander and of Ptolemy, crowned with\n chaplets of ivy-leaves made of gold. And the statue of Virtue, which stood by the\n side of that of Ptolemy, had a golden crown of olive-leaves. And Priapus was with\n them, having a crown of ivy-leaves made of gold. And the city of Corinth had a\n large image there, standing by the side of Ptolemy, and that also wore a golden\n diadem; and by all these lay a large golden beaufet full of articles of gold\n plate, and a golden goblet containing five measures. And this wagon was followed\n by women having very sumptuous dresses and ornaments, and they bore the names of\n cities, some of cities of Ionia, and other Grecian towns, as many as, occupying\n the islands, and the coast of Asia, were made subject to the Persians; and they\n all wore golden crowns. And on other chariots there was borne a golden thyrsus\n ninety cubits long, and silver spear sixty cubits long; and on another a golden\n phallus, a hundred and twenty cubits long, chased all over, and wreathed with\n golden garlands, having on the end a golden star, the circumference of which was\n six cubits. \n \"Now in all the numerous things which we have enumerated as forming part of this\n procession, we have selected those only in which gold and silver were contained.\n But there were numerous other articles and parts of the exhibition well worth\n seeing, and vast numbers of beasts and of horses, and twenty-four enormous lions.\n There were also other four-wheeled wagons in great numbers, bearing not only\n statues of kings, but also full of images of the gods. And after them proceeded a\n band of six hundred men, among whom were three hundred harp-players playing on\n their instruments, having harps made entirely of gold, and\n golden crowns on their heads; and after them came two thousand bulls all of the\n same colour, with gilded horns, and having frontlets of gold, and crowns in the\n middle of their foreheads, and necklaces and breastplates on their necks and\n chests, and these were all made of gold. \n ","33":"\n \"And after this came a procession in honour of Jupiter and of many other gods; and\n after all these, came a procession in honour of Alexander, who had a golden statue\n borne on a chariot drawn by real elephants, having Victory and Minerva on each\n side of him. And numbers of thrones were borne in the procession, made of ivory\n and gold, on one of which lay a crown of gold; on another a pair of horns made of\n gold; on another was a golden chaplet; and on another a single horn made of solid\n gold. And on the throne of Ptolemy Soter lay a crown which had been made of ten\n thousand pieces of gold money. And there were also carried in the procession three\n hundred and fifty golden incense burners, and golden altars, all crowned with\n golden crowns, on one of which were firmly placed four golden lamps ten cubits\n high. There were also carried twelve stoves with golden tops, one of which was\n twelve cubits in circumference, and forty cubits in height; and another was\n fifteen cubits high. There were also carried nine Delphic tripods made of gold,\n each four cubits high, and eight others six cubits high; another thirty cubits\n high, on which were figures of animals carved in gold, four cubits high, and a\n crown of vine-leaves of gold going all round.

And there was a separate mystic crown made of gold studded with valuable\n stones, eighty cubits high. This was the crown which was placed at the door of the\n temple of Berenice; and there was also an regis of gold. There were also exhibited a vast number of golden chaplets, which were\n borne by young maidens sumptuously attired, one of which was two cubits high, and\n sixteen cubits in circumference. \n \"There was also exhibited a golden breastplate twelve cubits broad, and another\n breastplate of silver eighteen cubits broad, having on it two golden thunderbolts\n of the size of ten cubits each, and a garland of oak-leaves studded with precious\n stones; and twenty golden shields, and sixty-four suits of complete armour also of\n gold, and two golden greaves three cubits in height, and twelve golden dishes, and\n a most countless number of flagons, and thirty-six vessels for wine, and ten large\n anointing vessels, and twelve ewers, and fifty large dishes for barley loaves, and\n tables of different sorts, and five repositories for gold plate, and a horn thirty\n cubits long made of solid gold. And all these articles of gold plate were\n exclusive of those carried in the procession of Bacchus. Then there were four\n hundred wagons of silver plate, and twenty wagons of gold plate, and eight hundred\n of perfumes and spices. \n ","34":"\n \n And after all these things came a procession of troops, both. cavalry and\n infantry, all armed and appointed in a most superb manner: infantry to the\n number of fifty-seven thousand six hundred; and cavalry to the number of\n twenty-three thousand two hundred. And all these marched in the procession, all\n clad in suitable apparel, and all having their appropriate armour; and there\n were also great numbers of suits of armour besides lying for inspection, too\n numerous for any one to count, (but Callixenus has made a catalogue of them;)\n and they were also crowned in the assembly with twenty golden crowns. And first\n of all Ptolemy and Berenice were crowned with twenty-three, standing on golden\n chariots, in the sacred precincts of Dodona. And the expense of money which was\n incurred on this occasion, amounted to two thousand two hundred and thirty-nine\n talents, ad fifty mine; and this was all counted by the clerks of the treasury,\n owing to the eagerness of those who\n had given the crowns, before the spectacle came to an end. But Ptolemy\n Philadel- phus, their son, was crowned with twenty golden\n crowns, two of them on golden chariots, and one six cubits high on a pillar,\n and five five cubits high, and six four cubits high. \n \n ","35":"\n Now my friends and fellow-banqueters, what kingdom ever possessed such quantities\n of gold as this? For Egypt did not acquire all this by taking money from the\n Persians and from Babylon, or by working mines, or by having a river Pactolus,\n bearing down gold-dust in its waters. For its only river is that which can really\n be called the Golden Stream\u2014the Nile, which together with its boundless supplies\n of food does bring down gold without alloy, which is dug up out of the soil\n without danger, in quantities sufficient for all men, diffused over the whole soil\n like the gifts of Triptolemus. On which account the Byzantine poet, who had the\n name of Parmeno given to him, says\u2014 \n O god of Egypt, mighty Nile. \n But king Philadelphus surpassed most kings in riches; and he pursued\n every kind of manufacturing and trading art so zealously, that he also surpassed\n every one in the number of his ships. Now the largest ships which he had were\n these:\u2014 two of thirty banks of oars, one of twenty, four of thirteen, two of\n twelve, fourteen of eleven, thirty of nine, thirty-seven of seven, five of six,\n seventeen of five. And from quadriremes down to light half-decked triremes, for\n purposes of war, he had twice as many as all these put together. And the vessels\n which were sent to the different islands and to the other cities under his\n dominion, and to Libya, amounted to more than four thousand. And concerning the\n numbers of his books, and the way in which he furnished his libraries, and the way\n in which he collected treasures for his Museum, why need I speak? for every one\n remembers all these things. \n ","36":"\n But since we have mentioned the subject of the building of ships, let us speak\n (for it is worth hearing of) of the ships which were built also by Ptolemy\n Philopator, which are mentioned by the same Callixenus in the first book of his\n Account of Alexandria, where he speaks as follows:\u2014\"Philopator built a ship with\n forty ranks of rowers, being two hundred and eighty cubits long and thirty-eight\n cubits from one side to the other; and in height up to the gunwale it was\n forty-eight cubits; and from the highest part of the stern to the water-line was\n fifty-three cubits; and it had four rudders, each thirty\n cubits long; and oars for the thranit\u00e6, the largest thirty-eight cubits in length,\n which, from having lead in their handles, and because they were very heavy it the\n part inside the ship, being accurately balanced, were, in spite of their bulk,\n very handy to use. And the ship had two heads and two sterns, and seven beaks, one\n of which was longer than all the rest, and the others were of smaller size; and\n some of them were fixed to the ears of the ship; and it had twelve undergirths to\n support the keel, and each was six hundred cubits in length. And it was well\n proportioned to a most extraordinary degree; and all the appointments of the\n vessel were admirable, for it had figures of animals on it not less than twelve\n cubits in size, both at the head and at the stern, and every part of it was inlaid\n and ornamented with figures in wax; and the space between the oars down to the\n very keel had a running pattern of ivy-leaves and thyrsi; and there was great\n store of every kind of equipment to supply all parts of the ship that might\n require any. And when it put to sea it held more than four\n thousand rowers, and four hundred supernumeraries; and on the deck were three\n thousand marines, or at least two thousand eight hundred and fifty. And besides\n all these there was another large body of men under the decks, and a vast quantity\n of provisions and supplies. And the vessel was launched originally from a sort of\n framework, which they say was erected and made out of the wood of fifty ships of\n five ranks of oars; and it was launched by the multitude with great acclamations\n and blowing of trumpets. But after that a Ph\u0153nician devised a new method of\n launching it, having dug a trench under it, equal to the ship itself in length,\n which he dug close to the harbour. And in the trench he built props of solid stone\n five cubits deep, and across them he laid beams crosswise, running the whole width\n of the trench, at four cubits' distance from one another; and then making a\n channel from the sea he filled all the space which he had excavated with water,\n out of which he easily brought the ship by the aid of whatever men happened to be\n at hand; then closing the entrance which had been originally made, he drained the\n water off again by means of engines; and when this had been done the vessel rested\n securely on the before-mentioned cross-beams. \n \n ","37":"\n \"Philopator also built a vessel for the river which he called Thalamegus, or the\n Carrier of his Bed-chamber, in length half a stadium, and in width at the broadest\n part thirty cubits; and the height together with the frame for the awning was\n little short of forty cubits. And its appearance was not exactly like ships of\n war, nor merchant vessels either, but it was something different from both, on\n account of the necessity imposed by the depth of the river. For below it was flat\n and broad; but in its main hull it was high. And the parts at the extremity, and\n especially at the head, extended a sufficient length, so as to exhibit a very\n pretty and elegant sweep. This ship also had two heads and two sterns. And it rose\n to a considerable height above the water, as was necessary, because the waves in\n the river often rise very high. And in the middle of its hull were constructed\n banqueting-rooms and sleeping-rooms, and everything else which may be convenient\n for living in. And round the ship were double corridors running about three sides,\n each of which was not less than five plethra in circumference. And the arrangement\n of the lower one was like a peristyle, and that in the upper part was covered in,\n and surrounded with walls and windows on all sides. And when you first came into\n the vessel by the stern your eye was met by a colonnade, open in front, and\n surrounded by pillars. And opposite to it in the bow of the vessel there was a\n sort of propyl\u00e6um constructed, made of ivory and most expensive woods. And after\n you had passed through that, then you came to something like a proscenium, covered\n in overhead. And again in the same way in the middle of the vessel was another\n colonnade, open behind, and an entrance of four folding-doors led to it. And both\n on the right hand and on the left there were windows, admitting a pleasant\n breeze. \n \"To these was joined a room of very large size, and that was adorned with pillars\n all round, and it was capable of containing twenty couches. And the greater part\n of it was made of split cedar, and of Milesian cypress. And the doors which were\n round it, being twenty in number, were put together with beams of citron wood,\n having ivory ornaments. And all the nails and fastenings which were visible were\n made of red brass, which had taken a polish like that of gold from the fire. And\n of the pillars the bodies were of cypress-wood, but the capitals were of\n Corinthian workmanship, adorned with ivory and gold. The whole of the capitals of\n the pillars were of gold; and there was a sort of girdle on\n them having figures of animals beautifully carved in ivory, more than a cubit\n high, of which the workmanship was not so conspicuous as the exquisite beauty of\n the materials. There was a beautiful roof to the banqueting-room, square, and made\n of cypress wood. And its ornaments were all carved, having a golden face. Next to\n this banqueting-chamber was a sleeping-chamber holding seven couches; and to that\n there was joined a narrow passage, which separated the woman's chamber from this\n one by the width of the hold. And by the passage was a bauqueting-room holding\n nine couches, very like the large one in the sumptuousness of its furniture; and a\n bedchamber holding five couches. As to the rooms then on the first deck this was\n the general appearance presented. \n ","38":"\n \"But when you had ascended by the stairs which were close to the before-mentioned\n sleeping chamber, there was another chamber capable of containing five couches,\n having a vaulted oblong roof. And near to it was a temple of Venus, in form like a\n rotunda, in which was a marble statue of the goddess. And opposite to this was\n another banqueting-room, very sumptuous, adorned all round with columns: for the\n columns were all made of Indian stone. And near to this banqueting-room were more\n sleeping-chambers, with furniture and appointments corresponding to what has been,\n already mentioned. And as you went on towards the head of the vessel was another\n apartment dedicated to Bacchus, capable of holding thirteen couches, surrounded\n with pillars having its cornices all gilt as far down as the epistyle which ran\n round the room, but the roof corresponded to the character of the god. And in it\n there was on the right hand a large cave constructed, the colour of which was\n stone, for in fact it was made of real stone and gold; and in it images were\n placed of all the relations of the king, made of the stone called lychnites. And\n there was another banqueting-room, very pleasant, above the roof of the greatest\n apartment, having an arrangement like that of a tent, so that some of it had no\n actual roof; but there were arched and vaulted beams running along the top at\n intervals, along which purple curtains were stretched whenever the vessel was in\n motion. And after this there was an open chamber occupying the same room above\n that was occupied by the portico before mentioned as being below. And a winding\n ladder joined on to it, leading to the secret walk, and a\n banqueting-room capable of containing nine couches, constructed and furnished in\n the Egyptian style. For round pillars were run up in it, with alternate tambours\n of white and black, all placed in parallel lines. And their heads were of round\n shape; and the whole of the figures round them were engraved like roses a little\n expanded. And round that part which is called the basket there were not tendrils\n and rough leaves, as is the case in Grecian pillars, but calyxes of the\n river-lotus, and the fruit of newly budding dates. And sometimes many other kinds\n of flowers were also represented. And under the roof of the capital which lies\n upon the tambour, where it joins on to the head, there were ornaments like the\n flower leaves of the Egyptian bean intertwined together. This then is the way in\n which the Egyptians construct and ornament their pillars, and this is the way in\n which they variegate their walls with black and white bricks: and sometimes also\n they employ the stone which is called alabaster. And there were many other\n ornaments all over the main hull of the vessel, and over the centre, and many\n other chambers and divisions in every part of it. \n \n And the mast of this vessel was seventy cubits in height, and it had a\n linen sail, adorned with a purple fringe. And the whole of the wealth which had\n been so carefully preserved by king Philadelphus was dissipated by the last\n Ptolemy, who also excited the war against Gabinius, who was not a man, but a\n mere flute-player and conjuror. \n \n ","39":"\n But concerning the ship built by Hiero, the tyrant of Syracuse, which also\n Archimedes the geometrician superintended, I do not think it right to be silent,\n since a certain man named Moschion has given a description of it, which I read\n over with great care very lately. \n Moschion, then, writes as follows:\u2014\"Diocles, a citizen of Abdera, speaks with\n great admiration of the engine called Helepolis, which was brought by Demetrius\n against the city of the Rhodians, and applied to their walls. And Tim\u00e6us extols\n highly the funeral pile made for Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. And Hieronymus\n lavishes his admiration on the building and adorning of the chariot in which the\n body of Alexander was borne to the tomb. And Polycletus speaks in high terms of\n the candlestick which was made for the king of Persia. But\n Hiero, the king of the Syracusans, who was in every respect a friend to the\n Romans, was very attentive to the furnishing of temples and gymnasia; and was also\n very earnest in ship-building, having built a great number of vessels to carry\n corn; the construction of one of which I will describe. For the wood, he caused\n such a number of trees to be cut down on Mount Aetna as would have been sufficient\n for sixty triremes, and when this was done he prepared nails, and planks for the\n sides and for the inside, and wood for every other purpose that could be required,\n some from Italy and some from Sicily. And for ropes he provided cordage from\n Spain, and hemp, and pitch from the river Rhone; and he collected great quantities\n of useful things from all quarters. And he collected also shipwrights and other\n artisans. And having appointed Archias the Corinthian the superintendent of them\n all, and the principal architect, he bade them labour at the construction with\n zeal and earnestness, he himself also devoting his days to watching its progress.\n And in this way he finished half the ship in six months; and every part of the\n vessel as soon as it was finished was immediately covered over with plates of\n lead. And there were three hundred workmen employed in working up the timber,\n besides the subord nate journeymen whom they had to assist them. And it was\n arranged to draw this portion that was done so far down to the sea, that it might\n receive the last finishing strokes there. And when there was a great inquiry as to\n the best method of launching it into the sea, Archimedes the mechanician launched\n it by himself with the aid of a few persons. Eor having prepared a helix he drew\n this vessel, enormous as it was, down into the sea. And Archimedes was the first\n person who ever invented this helix. But after the remainder of the ship had also\n been completed in six months more, and it had been surrounded all round with\n brazen nails, the greater part of which weighed ten min\u00e6, and the rest were half\n as big again\u2014(and they were driven in through holes made beforehand by gimlets, so\n as to hold the planks firm; and they were fastened to the wood with leaden plugs;\n pieces of cloth being put under, impregnated with pitch)\u2014after, I say, Hiero had\n completed the external figure of the vessel, he laboured at the interior. \n ","40":"\n \"And the vessel was constructed with twenty banks of oars,\n and three entrances, having the lowest entrance leading to the hold, to which the\n descent was by two ladders of many steps each: and the next was contrived for\n those who wished to go down to the eating-rooms: and the third was for the armed\n men. And on each side of the middle entrance were apartments for the men, each\n with four couches in them, thirty in number. And the supper-room for the sailors\n was capable of holding fifteen couches, and it had within it three chambers, each\n containing three couches; and the kitchen was towards the stern of the ship. And\n all these rooms had floors composed of mosaic work, of all kinds of stones\n tesselated. And on this mosaic the whole story of the Iliad was depicted in a\n marvellous manner. And in all the furniture and the ceilings and the doors\n everything was executed and finished in the same admirable manner. And along the\n uppermost passage was a gymnasium and walks, having their appointments in all\n respects corresponding to the size of the vessel. And in them were gardens of all\n sorts of most wonderful beauty, enriched with all sorts of plants, and shaded by\n roofs of lead or tiles. And besides this there were tents roofed with boughs of\n white ivy and of the vine, the roots of which derived their moisture from casks\n full of earth, and were watered in the same manner as the gardens. And the tents\n themselves helped to shadow the walks. And next to these things was a temple\n devoted to Venus, containing three couches, with a floor of agate and other most\n beautiful stones, of every sort which the island afforded. And its walls and its\n roof were made of cypress-wood, and its doors of ivory and citron-wood. And it was\n furnished in the most exquisite manner with pictures and statues, and with goblets\n and vases of every form and shape imaginable. \n ","41":"\n \"And next to that was a drawing-room capable of containing five couches, with its\n walls and doors made of boxwood, having a book-case in it, and along the roof a\n clock, imitated from the dial at Achradina. And there was also a bath-room,\n capable of containing three couches, having three brazen vessels for holding hot\n water, and a bath containing five measures of water, beautifully variegated with\n Tauromenian marble. And many rooms were also prepared for the marines, and for\n those who looked to the pumps. And besides all this there were ten stalls for\n horses on each side of the walls; and by them the fodder for\n the horses was kept, and the arms and furniture of the horsemen and of the boys.\n There was also a cistern near the head of the ship, carefully shut, and containing\n two thousand measures of water, made of beams closely compacted with pitch and\n canvass. And next to the cistern there was a large Water-tight well for fish, made\n so with beams of wood and lead. And it was kept full of sea-water, and great\n numbers of fish were kept in it. And on each side of the walls there were also\n projecting beams, placed at well-proportioned intervals; and to these were\n attached stores of wood, and ovens, and baking places, and mills, and many other\n useful offices. And all round the outside of the ship ran atlases six cubits high,\n which supported the weight which was placed above them, and the triglyph, all\n being placed at convenient distances from one another. And the whole ship was\n adorned with suitable pictures. \n ","42":"\n \"And in the vessel were eight towers of a size proportioned to the burden of the\n ship, two at the stern, and as many at the head, and the rest in the middle of the\n ship. And to each of these were fastened two large beams, or yards, from which\n port-holes were fixed, through which stones were let down upon any enemy who might\n come against the ship. And on each of the towers stood four young men fully armed,\n and two archers. And the whole of the interior of the towers was full of stones\n and darts. And a wall, having buttresses and decks, ran all through the ship,\n supported on trestles; and on these decks was placed a catapult, which hurled a\n stone weighing three talents, and an arrow twelve cubits long. And this engine was\n devised and made by Archimedes; and it could throw every arrow a furlong. And\n besides all this, there were mats composed of stout ropes \n suspended by brazen chains; and as there were three masts, from each of them were\n suspended two large yard bearing stones, from which hooks and leaden weights were\n let down upon any enemy which might attack the vessel. And there was also a\n palisade all round the ship, made of iron, as a defence against those who might\n attempt to board it; and iron ravens, as they were called, all round the ship,\n which, being shot forth by engines, seized on the vessels of the enemy, and\n brought them round so as to expose them to blows. And on each\n of the sides of the ship stood sixty young men clad in complete armour; and an\n equal number stood on the masts, and on the yards which carried the stones; and\n they were also on the masts, up at the mast-head, which was made of brass. On the\n first there were three men, and on the second two, and on the third one. And they\n had stones brought up to them in wicker baskets by means of pulleys, and arrows\n were supplied to them by boys, within the defended parts of the mast-heads. And\n the vessel had four wooden anchors and eight iron ones. And of the masts, the\n second and third were easily found; but the first was procured with difficulty\n among the mountains of the Bruttii, and was discovered by a swineherd. And\n Phileas, a mechanic of Tauromenium, brought it down to the seaside. And the hold,\n although of a most enormous depth, was pumped out by one man, by means of a\n pulley, by an engine which was the contrivance of Archimedes. And the name of the\n ship was 'The Syracusan;' but when Hiero sent it to sea, he altered its name and\n called it 'The Alexandrian.' \n \"And it had some small launches attached to it, the first of which was one of the\n light galleys called cercurus, able to hold a weight of three thousand talents;\n and it was wholly moved by oars. And after that came many galleys and skiffs of\n about fifteen hundred talents burthen. And the crew also was proportionably\n numerous; for besides the men who have been already mentioned, there were six\n hundred more, whose post was at the head of the ship, always watching for the\n orders of the captain. And there was a tribunal instituted to judge of all\n offences which might be committed on board the ship, consisting of the captain and\n the pilot, and the officer of the watch; and they decided in every case according\n to the laws of the Syracusans. \n ","43":"\n \n And they put on board the ship sixty thousand measures of corn, and ten\n thousand jars of Sicilian salt-fish, and twenty thousand talents weight of\n wool, and of other cargo twenty thousand talents weight also. And besides all\n this, there were the provisions necessary for the crew. And Hiero, when he had\n understood that there was no harbour in Sicily large enough to admit this ship,\n and, moreover, that some of the harbours were dangerous for any vessel,\n determined to send it as a present to Alexandria to\n Ptolemy the king of Egypt. For there was a great dearth of corn in Egypt. And\n he did so; and the ship came to Alexandria, where it was put in port. And Hiero\n honoured Archimelus, also, the epigrammatic poet, who wrote an epigram on the\n ship, with a thousand bushels of wheat, which he also sent at his own expense\n to the Pir\u00e6us; and the epigram runs thus\u2014 \n Who placed this monstrous mass upon the earth; \n What master led it with untiring cables, \n How was the deck nail'd to the mighty beams, \n And with what axe did men the vessel form? \n Surely it equals Aetna in its height, \n Or any isle which rises from the sea \n Where the Egean wave entwined foams \n Amid the Cyclades; on either side \n Its breadth is equal, and its walls alike. \n Sure 'twas the giants' work, who hoped to reach \n By such vast ladder to the heights of heaven. \n Its topmast reaches to the stars; and hides \n Its mighty bulwarks 'mid the endless clouds. \n It holds its anchors with untiring cables, \n Like those with which proud Xerxes bound the strait \n Which between Sestos and Abydos foams. \n A deftly carved inscription on the side \n Shows what strong hand has launch'd it on the deep; \n It says that Hiero, Hierocles' son, \n The king of Sicily, pride of Dorian race, \n Sends it a wealthy messenger of gifts \n To the Aegean islands; and the God \n Who rules the sea, great Neptune, convoys it \n Safe o'er the blue and foaming waves to Greece. \n And I intentionally pass over the sacred trireme built by Antigonus,\n which defeated the commanders of Ptolemy off Leucolla, a city under the\n dominion of Cos; and after that, Antigonus consecrated it to Apollo; but it was\n not one-third, or perhaps not even one-fourth part of the size of the Syracusan\n or Alexandrian vessel. \n \n ","44":"\n All this, then, we have said about the catalogue of the ships, not beginning with\n the B\u0153otians, but with the shows and processions exhibited at public assemblies. And\n since I know that my excellent friend Ulpian will attack s again, and ask what\n that thing is which Callixenus calls \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7, we\n tell him that there is a speech which is attributed to Lysias\n the orator, written about the \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7, which\n begins with these words\u2014 If, O judges, Lysimanes had said anything\n reasonable or moderate. And going on a little, he proceeds to\n say\u2014 I should not have been eager to plead in an action about this chest\n ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 ), which is not worth thirty\n drachm\u00e6. And presently he tells us that the chest was a brazen\n one\u2014 But when I wished last year to repair it I gave it to a brazier; for\n it is well put together, and has the faces of Satyrs and large heads of oxen\n carved upon it. There is also another coffer of the same size; for the same\n workman made many such articles of the same size, and alike in many\n particulars. In these words Lysias, having said that the chest was made\n of brass, shows plainly enough, as Callixenus also said, that they were things\n that might be used as stands for kettles. For so Polemo Periegetes said, in the\n third of those books of his which are addressed to Ad\u00e6us and Antigonus, where he\n explains the subject of the picture which is at Phlius, in the portico of the\n polemarchs, painted by Sillax the Rhegian, who is mentioned by Epicharmus and\n Simonides. And his words are\u2014 \n \u02bc\u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7, and a large goblet on it. \n And Hegesander the Delphian, in his book entitled a Commentary on Statues and\n Images, says that the pedestal dedicated by Glaucus the Chian at Delphi is like an\n iron \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7, the gift of Alyattes. And that is\n mentioned by Herodotus, who calls it \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (a stand for a goblet). And Hegesander uses the same\n expression. And we ourselves have seen that lying at Delphi, a thing really worth\n looking at, on account of the figures of animals which are carved upon it, and of\n other insects, and living things, and plants. . . . . . . . can be put upon it,\n and goblets, and other furniture. \n But the thing which is called by the Alexandrians \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 is a triangular vessel, hollow in the middle, capable of\n receiving an earthen wine-jar inside of it. And poor men have this made of wood,\n but rich men have it of brass or of silver. \n ","45":"\n Having said this much about the \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7, let us\n now go on to speak of those kings who are and have been fond of good cheer. For\n the king, who is the namesake of the abovementioned Antiochus, and the son of\n Demetrius, according to the account of Posidonius, used to entertain a great crowd\n of people every day, and in addition to what they ate on the \n spot, he would give every one of the guests large heaps, consisting of entire\n joints of meat of beasts, and birds, and fishes, undivided and ready dressed,\n enough to fill a wagon. And besides all this, he gave them heaps of hone-cakes,\n and of garlands, of myrrh, and frankincense, with large fillets and bandages of\n golden embroidery as long as a man. And another king, Antiochus, when celebrating\n the games at Daphne, himself also made very sumptuous entertainments, as\n Posidonius himself relates; and he was the first person who ever made a\n distribution among the guests of whole joints of meat; and also of geese, and\n hares, and antelopes alive. And golden chaplets were also given to the guests, and\n a great quantity of silver plate, and of slaves, and horses, and camels. And each\n man was bound to get on the camel and drink a draught of wine, and then to accept\n of the camel and of the boy who stood by it. And, says he,\n all the natives and inhabitants of Syria, on account of the fertility of\n the land, are accustomed to make frequent feasts after their necessary labours,\n in order that they may rejoice together, using their gymnasia as baths, and\n anointing themselves with expensive oil and perfumes; and at their grammatea\n (for that is the name which they give to their public entertainments) living as\n if in their own houses, and gratifying their stomachs the greater part of the\n day with wine and meat, and also carrying away a quantity of the same to their\n own homes, they thus spend the day, listening also to the music of the loud\n lyre made of the tortoise shell, so that whole cities resound with noises of\n this kind \n \n ","46":"\n And I, my friends, praise very much the entertainment which was given by Alexander\n the king of Syria. And this Alexander was a supposititious son of Antiochus\n Epiphanes, substituted on account of the hatred which all men bore to Demetrius,\n concerning whom our companion Athen\u00e6us has spoken in his treatise on the Kings who\n have reigned in Syria. Now that entertainment was conducted as nearly as may be in\n this fashion. \n Diogenes the Epicurean, having a very tolerable acquaintance with the doctrines of\n the sect which he professed, was by birth a native of Seleucia, in the district of\n Babylon. And he was kindly received by the king, although the monarch rather\n inclined to the doctrines of the Stoic school. Accordingly,\n Alexander treated him with great distinction, although a man of anything but a\n reputable course of life, and so given to calumny and envy, that if he could raise\n a laugh by it, he could not abstain from even the king himself. And when he\n preferred to the king a request that had no great connexion with\n philosophy\u2014namely, that he might be allowed to wear a purple robe and a golden\n crown, having a face of Virtue in the centre of it, as he claimed to be addressed\n as the priest of Virtue, he agreed to it all, and besides that, made him a present\n of the crown. And these ornaments Diogenes, being in love with a woman who was one\n of the Bacchanalian singers, gave to her. But Alexander, hearing of this,\n collected a banqueting party of philosophers and eminent men, and among them he\n invited Diogenes. And when he arrived he begged him to take his seat with his\n crown and his purple robe on. And when he replied that that would be unseemly, the\n king nodded to his servants to introduce the musicians, among whom this singing\n woman appeared, crowned with the crown of Virtue, and clothed also in the purple\n robe. So when every one burst into laughter at this, the philosopher kept quiet,\n and never stopped praising the singing woman. \n But Antiochus, who succeeded Alexander in the kingdom, could not tolerate the\n abusive language of this Diogenes, and accordingly ordered him to be put to death.\n But Alexander was at all times, and in all circumstances, of a gentle disposition,\n and affable to every one in conversation, and not at all like Athenion the\n Peripatetic philosopher, who had a philosophical school at Athens, and at Messene,\n and also at Larissa in Thessaly, and who subsequently became tyrant of Athens;\n concerning whom Posidonius of Apamea gives a very particular account, which I,\n even though it is rather long, will quote, in order that we may come to a thorough\n understanding and appreciation of those men who profess to be philosophers, and\n that we may not be taken in by their ragged cloaks and unshaven chins. For, as\n Agatho says\u2014 \n If I do tell the truth I shall not please you; \n And if I please you, I shall speak no truth. \n But let truth, as the saying is, be one's\n friend. At all events, I will quote the account given of the man. \n ","47":"\n \"In the school of Erymneus the Peripatetic there was a certain man of the name of\n Athenion, who applied himself very perseveringly to\n philosophical discussions. He, having bought an Egyptian female slave, made her\n his mistress. And when she became a mother, either by him or by some one else, the\n child was bred up by Athenion, and received the same name as his master. And\n having been taught literature, he became accustomed to lead his master about when\n he became an old man, in company with his mother; and when he died he succeeded\n him as his heir, and became a citizen of Athens, being enrolled under the name of\n Athenion. And having married a very beautiful girl, after that he betook himself\n to the profession of a sophist, hunting out for boys to come to his school. And\n having pursued his profession of sophist at Messene and at Larissa in Thessaly,\n and having amassed a considerable fortune, he returned to Athens. And having been\n appointed an ambassador by the Athenian people, when the chief power in all that\n district was lodged in the hands of Mithridates, he insinuated himself into the\n good graces of the king, and became one of his friends, being held by him in the\n greatest honour; in consequence of which he wrote letters to the Athenians to\n raise their spirits, as one who had the greatest influence with the king of\n Cappadocia, leading them to hope that they should be discharged of all their\n existing debts, and live in peace and concord with him; and also that they should\n recover their democratic constitution, and receive great presents both publicly\n and privately. And the Athenians boasted of all these promises which were made to\n them, feeling sure that the supremacy of the Romans would be put an end to. \n ","48":"\n \"Now when all Asia had revolted to the King, Athenio set out to return to Athens;\n and being tossed about by a storm he was driven to Carystus. And when the\n Cecropid\u00e6 heard this, they sent some ships of war to conduct him back, and a\n litter with silver feet. And now he is entering the city; and almost the whole of\n the citizens has poured out to meet him; and many other spectators came together,\n marvelling at this preposterous freak of fortune, that this intrusive citizen,\n Athenion, foisted into Athens in such a manner, should be conducted into the city\n on a litter with silver feet, and lying on purple clothes, a man who had never\n before seen even purple patch on his ragged cloak; when no one, not even of the\n Romans, had ever exhibited such pomp and insulting show in\n Attica before. So there ran to this spectacle men, women, children, all expecting\n some glorious honours from Mithridates. While Athenio, that ancient beggar, who\n gave lectures for trifling sums of money, was now making a procession through the\n country and through the city, relying on the king's favour, and treating every one\n with great insolence. There met him also the artisans of the spectacles of\n Bacchus, calling him a messenger of the young Bacchus, and inviting him to the\n common altar, and to the prayers and libations which were to be offered at it; and\n he, who had formerly come out of a hired house, into the * * * * * was conducted\n into a mansion adorned with couches, and pictures, and statues, and a display of\n silver plate. And from it he issued forth, dragging on the ground a bright cloak,\n and with a golden ring on his finger, having on it a carved portrait of\n Mithridates. And numbers of attendants went before him and followed him in\n procession. And in the plot of ground belonging to the artisans, sacrifices were\n performed in honour of the return of Athenio, and libations made with formal\n proclamation by a herald. And the next day many people came to his house and\n awaited his appearance; and the whole Ceramicus was full of citizens and\n foreigners, and there was a voluntary thronging of the whole population of the\n city to the assembly. And at last he came forth, being attended by all who wished\n to stand well with the people, as if they had been his bodyguards, every one\n hastening even to touch his garment. \n ","49":"\n \n He then having ascended the tribunal which had been erected for the Roman\n generals in front of the portico of Attalus, standing on it, and looking round\n on all the people in a circle, and then looking up, said, 'O men of Athens, the\n state of affairs and the interests of my country compel me to relate to you\n what I know. But the greatness of the affairs that must be mentioned, owing to\n the unexpected character which circumstances have assumed, hinders me from\n doing so.' And when all the bystanders called out to him with one accord to be\n of good cheer, and to tell them, I tell you, then,' said he, ' of\n things which have never been hoped for, nor even imagined by any one in a dream.\n The king Mithridates is master of Bithynia, and of Upper Cappadocia; and he is\n master of the whole of Asia, without any break, as far as Pamphylia and Cilicia:\n and the kings of the Armenians and Persians are only his\n guards; and he is lord of all the nations which dwell around the Palus M\u00e6otis, and\n the whole of Pontus, so that his dominions are upwards of thirty thousand furlongs\n in circumference. And the Roman commander in Pamphylia, Quintus Oppius, has been\n surrendered to him, and is following him as a prisoner, but Manius Aquillius, a\n man of consular rank, who has celebrated a triumph for his victory over the\n Sicilians, is fastened by a long chain to Bastarna, a man of gigantic stature, and\n is dragged byhim on foot at the tail of his horse. And of the other Roman citizens\n in Asia some have fallen down at the images of the gods, and the rest have put on\n square cloaks and acknowledge again the claims of their original country. And\n every city honouring him with more than human honours, galls the king a god; and\n oracles everywhere promise him the dominion over the whole world, on which account\n he is now sending large armies against Thrace and Macedonia, and every part of\n Europe is coming over bodily to his side. For ambassadors are coming to him, not\n only from the Italian tribes, but also from the Carthaginians, begging him to\n enter into alliance with them for the destruction of the Romans.' \n ","50":"\n \"Having stopped a little after saying this, and having given time for the\n multitude to converse together about the news thus unexpectedly announced to them,\n he wiped his face, and went on, 'What then do I advise?\u2014Not to bear this state of\n anarchy any longer, which the Roman senate makes continue, while it is deciding\n what constitution you are to enjoy for the future. And do not let us be\n indifferent to our temples being closed, to our gymnasia being left in the dirt,\n to our theatre being always empty, and our courts of justice mute, and the Pnyx,\n consecrated by the oracles of the gods, being taken from the people. Let us not, O\n Athenians, be indifferent to the sacred voice of Bacchus being reduced to silence,\n to the holy temple of Castor and Pollux being closed, and to the schools of the\n philosophers being silence as they are.' And when this slave had said all this and\n a good deal more, the multitude conversing with one another and running together\n to the theatre elected Athenio general over the entire army. And then, the\n Peripatetic coming into the orchestra, walking like Pythocles, thanked the\n Athenians, and said, 'Now you yourselves are your own generals; and I am the commander-in-chief: and if you exert all your strength to\n co-operate with me I shall be able to do as much as all of you put together.' And\n he, having said this, appointed others to be his colleagues in the command,\n proposing whatever names he thought desirable. \n ","51":"\n \"And a few days afterwards, the philosopher having thus appointed himself tyrant,\n and having proved how much weight is to be attached to the doctrine of the\n Pythagoreans about plots against others, and what was the practical effect of the\n philosophy which the admirable Pythagoras laid down, as Theopompus has related in\n the eighth book of his Philippics, and Hermippus, the Callimachean, has\n corroborated the account, he immediately removed all the citizens who were\n right-thinking and of a good disposition (contrary to the sentiments of, and rules\n laid down by, Aristotle and Theophrastus; showing how true is the proverb which\n says, Do not put a sword into the hand of a child); and he placed sentinels at the\n gates, so that many of the Athenians, fearing what he might be going to do, let\n themselves down over the walls by night, and so fled away. And Athenio sending\n some horsemen to pursue them slew some of them, and brought back some in chains,\n having a number of bodyguards about his person of the kind called phractici. And\n often he convened assemblies, pretending great attachment to the side of the\n Romans; and bringing accusations against many as having kept up communications\n with the exiles, and aiming at a revolution, he put them to death. And he placed\n thirty guards at each gate, and would not allow any one to go either in or out.\n And he seized on the property of many of the people, and collected such a quantity\n of money as to fill several wells; and he also sent all over the country people to\n lie in wait, as it were, for every one who was travelling, and they brought them\n to him; and he put them to death without any trial, torturing and racking them\n into the bargain. And he also instituted prosecutions for treason against several\n people, saying that they were co-operating with the exiles to effect their return.\n And some of the parties prosecuted fled out of fear before the trials came on, and\n some were condemned before the tribunals, he himself giving his own vote and\n collecting those of the others. And he brought about in the city a scarcity of the\n things necessary for life, stinting the citizens of their\n proper quantity of barley and wheat. He also sent out heavy-armed soldiers over\n the country, to hunt out any of those who had fled and who could be found within\n the borders of the land, or any of the Athenians who were escaping beyond the\n borders. And whoever was detected he beat to death; and some of them he exhausted\n beforehand with tortures; and he caused proclamation to be made, that all must be\n in their houses by sunset, and that no one should presume to walk abroad with a\n lantern-bearer. \n ","52":"\n \"And he not only plundered the property of the citizens, but that of foreigners\n also, laying his hands even on the property of the god which was laid up at Delos;\n sending Apellicon into the island, who was a Scian by birth, but who had become a\n citizen of Athens, and who lived a most whimsical and ever-changing course of\n life. For at one time he was a philosopher, and collected all the treatises of the\n Peripatetics, and the whole library of Aristotle, and many others; for he was a\n very rich man; and he had also stolen a great many autograph decrees of the\n ancients out of the temple of the Mighty Mother, and whatever else there was\n ancient and taken care of in other cities; and being detected in these practices\n at Athens he would have been in great danger if he had not made his escape; and a\n short time afterwards he returned again, having paid his court to many people, and\n he then joined himself to Athenion, as being a man of the same sect as he was. And\n Athenion, having embraced the doctrines of the Peripatetics, measured out a ch\u0153nix\n of barley, as four days' allowance for the ignorant Athenians, giving them what\n was barely food enough for fowl, and not the proper nutriment for men. And\n Apellicon, coming in great force to Delos, and living there more like a man\n exhibiting a spectacle than a general with soldiers, and placing guards in a very\n careless manner on the side of Delos, and leaving all the back of the island\n unguarded, and not even putting down a palisade in front of his camp, went to\n rest. And Orobius, the Roman general, hearing of this, who was at that time in\n command at Delos, watching for a moonless night, led out his troops, and falling\n on Apellicon and his soldiers, who were all asleep and drunk, he cut the Athenians\n and all those who were in the army with them to pieces, like so many sheep, to the\n number of six hundred, and he took four hundred alive. And\n that fine general, Apellicon, fled away without being perceived, and came to\n Delos; and Orobius seeing that many of those who fled with him had escaped to the\n farmhouses round about, burnt them in the houses, houses and all; and he destroyed\n by fire also all the engines for besieging cities, together with the Helepolis\n which Apellicon had made when he came to Delos. And Orobius having erected in that\n place a trophy and an altar, wrote this inscription on it\u2014 \n This tomb contains the foreigners here slain, \n Who fought near Delos, and who fell at sea, \n When the Athenians spoil'd the holy isle, \n Aiding in war the Cappadocian king.\" \n \n \n ","53":"\n There was also at Tarsus an Epicurean philosopher who had become the tyrant of\n that city, Lysias by name; who having been created by his countrymen\n Stephanephoros, that is to say, the priest of Hercules, did not lay down his\n command, but seized on the tyranny. He put on a purple tunic with a white centre, and over that he\n wore a very superb and costly cloak, and he put on white Laced\u00e6monian sandals, and\n assumed also a crown of golden daphne leaves. And he distributed the property of\n the rich among the poor, and put many to death who did not surrender their\n property willingly. \n ","54":"\n These are the commanders who became such from having been philosophers; concerning\n whom Demochares said,\u2014 Just as no one could make a spear out of a bulrush,\n so no one could make a faultless general out of Socrates. For Plato\n says that Socrates served in three military expeditions, one to Potid\u00e6a, and\n another to Amphipolis, and another against the B\u0153otians, in which last it was that\n the battle of Delium took place. And though no one has mentioned this\n circumstance, he himself says that he gained the prize of the most eminent valour,\n since all the other Athenians fled, and many were slain. But all this is an\n erroneous statement. For the expedition against Amphipolis took place in the\n archonship of Alc\u00e6us, when Cleon was the general; and it was\n composed entirely of picked men, as Thucydides relates. Socrates then, a man who\n had nothing but his ragged cloak and his stick, must have been one of these picked\n men. But what historian or poet has mentioned this fact? Or where has Thucydides\n made the slightest mention of Socrates, this soldier of Plato's? And what is there\n in common between a shield and a philosopher's staff? And when was it that\n Socrates bore a part in the expedition against Potidoea, as Plato has said in his\n Charmides, where he states that he then yielded the prize of preeminent valour to\n Alcibiades? though Thucydides has not mentioned it, nor has Isocrates in his\n Oration on the Pair-horse Chariot. And what battle ever took place when Socrates\n gained the prize of preeminent valour? And what eminent and notorious exploit did\n he perform; for indeed there was actually no battle at all at that time, as\n Thucydides tells us. \n But Plato not being content with all these strange stories, introduces the valour\n which was displayed, or rather which was invented by him at Delium. For if\n Socrates had even taken Delium, as Herodicus the Cratetian has reported in his\n Treatise to Philosocrates, he would have fled disgracefully as all the rest did,\n when Pagondas sent two squadrons of cavalry unperceived round the hill. For then\n some of the Athenians fled to Delium, and some fled to the sea, and some to\n Oropus, and some to Mount Parnes. And the B\u0153otians, especially with their cavalry,\n pursued them and slew them; and the Locrian cavalry joined in the pursuit and\n slaughter. When then this disorder and alarm had seized upon the Athenians, did\n Socrates alone, looking proud and casting his eyes around, stand firm, turning\n aside the onset of the B\u0153otian and Locrian cavalry? And yet does Thucydides make\n no mention of this valour of his, nor even any poet either. And how was it that he\n yielded to Alcibiades the prize of preeminent valour, who had absolutely never\n joined in this expedition at all? But in the Crito, Plato, that favourite of\n Memory, says that Socrates had never once gone out of Attica, except when he, once\n went to the Isthmian games. And Antisthenes, the Socratic philosopher, tells the\n same tale as Plato about the Aristeia; but the story is not true. For this Dog\n flatters Socrates in many particulars, on which account we must not believe either\n of them, keeping Thucydides for our guide. For Antisthenes \n even exaggerates this false story, saying,\u2014 'But we hear that you also\n received the prize of preeminent valour in the battle which took place against\n the B\u0153otians.' 'Be quiet, my friend, the prize belongs to Alcibiades, not to\n me.' 'Yes, but you gave it to him as we are told.' But Plato's Socrates\n says that he was present at Potid\u00e6a, and that he yielded the prize of preeminent\n valour to Alcibiades on that occasion. But by the universal consent of all\n historians the expedition against Potid\u00e6a, in which Phormio commanded, was\n previous to the one against Delium. \n ","55":"\n In every respect then the philosophers tell lies; and they are not aware that they\n commit numbers of anachronisms in the accounts which they give. And even the\n admirable Xenophon is not free from this error. For he in his Banquet introduces\n Callias, the son of Hipponicus, as the lover of Autolycus, the son of Lycon, and\n making an entertainment in his honour when he gained the victory in the\n Pancratium. And he represents himself as being present with the rest of the\n guests, when he perhaps was either not born, or at all events not out of\n childhood. And this is the time when Aristion was archon. For it was in his\n archonship that Eupolis exhibited the comedy Autolycus, in which, in the character\n of Demostratus, he ridicules the victory of Autolycus. And again Xenophon makes\n Socrates say at this Banquet\u2014 And Pausanias, indeed, the lover of Agathon\n the poet, when speaking in excuse of those who allow themselves to indulge in\n intemperance, said that a most valiant army might be composed of boys and their\n lovers; for that of all the men in the world they would be the most ashamed to\n desert one another. Saying a very strange thing,\u2014if men who are accustomed\n utterly to disregard all blame, and to behave with utter shamelessness to one\n another, would be the men above all others ashamed to do anything\n disgraceful. But that Pausanias never said anything of the sort we may\n see from the Banquet of Plato. For I know of no book at all which is written by\n Pausanias. Nor is he introduced by any one else as speaking of lovers and boys,\n but only by Plato. But whether Xenophon has absolutely invented this story, or\n whether he fell in with any edition of Plato's Banquet which reports what happened\n in a different manner, is of no importance; still we must take notice of the\n blunder as far as the time is concerned. Aristion, in whose\n time this banquet is represented as having taken place, was archon four years\n before Euphemus, in whose archonship Plato places the banquet given in honour of\n the victory of Agathon, at which banquet Pausanias said these things about lovers.\n So that it is a marvellous and incredible thing that Socrates w hen supping with\n Callias should find fault with things as having been said erroneously, which had\n not yet been said at all, and which were not said till four years afterwards at\n the banquet of Agathon. \n ","56":"\n But altogether Plato's Banquet is mere nonsense. For when Agathon got the victory\n Plato was fourteen years old. For the former was crowned at the Len\u00e6a in the\n archonship of Euphemus. But Plato was born in the year of the archonship of\n Apollodorus, who succeeded Euthydemus. And when he was eighty-two years old he\n died in the archonship of Theophilus, who succeeded Callimachus; for he is the\n eighty-second archon after Apollodorus. But from the archonship of Apollodorus and\n the birth of Plato, Euphemus is the fourteenth archon; and it is in his archonship\n that the banquet was given in honour of the victory of Agathon. And Plato himself\n shows that this entertainment had taken place a long time before, saying in the\n Banquet . . . . 'Do you think then that this entertainment has taken place\n but lately, so that I could have been present at it?' 'Indeed I do,' said he.\n 'How could that be,' said I, 'O Glaucon? Do you not know that Agathon has not\n been in the city for many years?' And then a little while after he\n says\u2014 ' But tell me, when did this entertainment take place?' And I\n replied, 'When we were still children, when Agathon gained the prize in\n tragedy. ' But that Plato makes many blunders in his chronology is\n plain from many circumstance. For as the poet said\u2014 The man has a tongue\n which pays no regard to seasons; so he writes without sufficient\n discernment. For he never spoke at random, but always with great\n consideration. \n ","57":"\n As for instance, writing in the Gorgias, he says\u2014 'Archelaus, then,\n according to your definition, is a miserable man.' 'Yes, my friend, if, at\n least, he is an unjust one.' And then, after expressly stating that\n Archelaus was possessed of the kingdom of the Macedonians, he goes on to say, \n that Pericles also was lately dead But if Pericles had only lately\n died, Archelaus was not yet in the enjoyment of his dominions at all; and if\n Archelaus was king at the time, then Pericles had been dead a long time. Now\n Perdiccas was king before Archelaus, according to the statement of Nicomedes of\n Acanthus; and he reigned forty-one years. But Theopompus says he reigned\n thirty-five years; Anaximenes, forty; Hieronymus, twenty-eight. But Marsyas and\n Philochorus say that he reigned only twenty-three years. Now, as these all vary so\n much in their accounts, we will take the smallest number, and say twenty-three.\n But Pericles died in the third year of the Peloponnesian war, in the archonship of\n Epameinon, in which year also Alexander died, and Perdiccas succeeded him in the\n kingdom. And he reigned till the archonship of Callias, in whose year Perdiccas\n died, and Archelaus succeeded to the kingdom. How, then, can Pericles have died\n lately, as Plato phrases it? And in the same Gorgias Plato represents Socrates as\n saying\u2014 And last year, when I drew the lot to be one of the council, when\n my tribe was the presiding tribe, and I had to put the question to the vote, I\n caused the people to laugh, as I did not know how to put the question to the\n vote. Now Socrates did not fall into this error out of ignorance, but\n out of his firm principles of virtue; for he did not choose to violate the laws of\n the democracy. And Xenophon shows this plainly in the first book of his Hellenics,\n where he gives the following account:\u2014 But when some of the prytanes said\n that they would not put the question contrary to the laws, Callixenus again\n mounts the tribunal and inveighs against them; and they cried out that he\n should impeach those who refused. And the prytanes being alarmed, all agreed to\n put the question except Socrates the son of Sophroniscus; and he said that he\n would not, but that he would do everything according to the laws. \n \n This was the question which was put to the vote against the generals, Erasinides\n and his colleagues, because they did not pick up the men who were lost in the\n naval battle at Arginus\u00e6. And this battle took place in the archonship of Callias,\n twenty-four years after the death of Pericles. \n ","58":"\n But the dialogue in the Protagoras, which took place after the death of\n Hipponicus, when Callias had entered upon his patrimonial\n inheritance, says that Protagoras had arrived in Athens for the second time not\n many days previously. But Hipponicus, in the archonship of Euthydenmus, was a\n colleague of Nicias in the generalship against the Tanagreans and against those\n B\u0153otians who acted as their allies; and he defeated them in a battle. And he died\n before Eupolis exhibited the Flatterers, which took place in the archonship of\n Alc\u00e6us, but probably not any long time before. For the play proves that the\n succession of Callias to his patrimonial inheritance was still quite recent. Now\n in this play Eupolis introduces Protagoras as living at Athens. And Ameipsias, in\n his Connus, which was exhibited two years before, does not enumerate him among the\n band of sophists. So it is plain that this happened in the interval between those\n two periods. But Plato represents Hippias the Elian also, in the Protagoras, as\n present with some of his own fellow-citizens, men who it is not likely could have\n remained long in Athens with safety, before the truce for a year was made in the\n archonship of Isarchus, in the month Elaphebolion. But he represents this dialogue\n as having taken place, not about the time when the truce had recently been made,\n but a long time after that; at all events he says\u2014 For if they were savage\n men, such as Pherecrates the poet exhibited last year at the Len\u00e6an\n festival. But the play of The Savage Men was exhibited in the\n archonship of Aristion, who was succeeded as archon by Astyphilus, (being the\n fifth after Isarchus,) in whose archonship the truce was made; for Isarchus came\n first, then Ameinias, then Aristion, then Astyphilus: so that it is contrary to\n history that Plato in his dialogue brings to Athens Hippias and his companions,\n who were enemies at the time, when this truce had not yet any existence. \n ","59":"\n And among other things Plato says that Ch\u00e6rephon asked the Pythian priestess\n whether any one was wiser than Socrates? and that she replied, No one. But Xenphon\n does not agree with all this; but says\u2014 For when Dh\u00e6rephon once asked at\n Delphi about me, Apollo replied, in the presence of many witnesses, that no man\n was either more just or more temperate than I was. And how can it be\n either reasonable or probable that Socrates, who confessed that he knew nothing,\n should allege that he had been called the wisest of all men by God who knows\n everything? For if knowing nothing be wisdom, then to know\n everything must be folly. And what was the need of Chaerephon bothering the god,\n and asking him about Socrates? for he himself might have been believed in his own\n case, saying that he was not wise. For he must be a stupid man who would put such\n a question to the god, as if he were to ask him such a question as this, Whether\n any wool is softer than the Attic wool; or, Whether there are any more powerful\n nations than the Bactrians and the Medes; or, Whether any one has a more complete\n pug-nose than Socrates. For people who ask such questions as these have a very\n neat slap in the face given them by the god, as when a man asked him (whether it\n is a fable of Aesop's or of some one else), \n O mighty son of Leto and of Jove, \n Tell me by what means I may rich become: \n he, ridiculing him, answered\u2014 \n If you acquire all the land that lies \n Between the tow'rs of Sicyon and Corinth. \n \n \n ","60":"\n But indeed, no one even of the comic poets has said such things as Plato has said\n about Socrates, neither that he was the son of a very fierce-looking nurse, nor\n that Xantippe was an ill-tempered woman, who even poured slops over his head; nor\n that Alcibiades slept with him under the same cloak; and yet this must have been\n divulged with boisterous laughter by Aristophanes, as he was present at the\n banquet according to Plato's account; for Aristophanes would never have suppressed\n such a circumstance as that, which would have given such a colour to the charge\n that he corrupted the youth. \n Aspasia, indeed, who was the clever preceptress of Socrates in rhetoric, in these\n verses which are attributed to her, which Herodicus the Cratetian has quoted,\n speaks thus\u2014 \n \n As. O Socrates, most clearly do I see \n How greatly you're inflamed by tender love \n For the young son of Clinias and Dinomache; \n But if you wish to prosper list to me, \n And do not scoff at my advice, but follow it, \n And it shall be the better for your suit. \n \n Soc. I when I heard your speech was so o'erjoy'd \n That straightway sweat did overflow each limb; \n And tears unbidden pour'd forth from my eyes. \n \n As. Restrain yourself, and fill your mind with\n strains \n \n Such as the Muse who conquers men will teach you, \n And you will charm him by your dulcet songs. \n They the foundation lay of mutual love. \n And thus will you o'ercome him, fettering \n His mind with gifts with which his ears are charm'd \n The admirable Socrates then goes a hunting, having the Milesian woman for\n his tutor in love. But he himself is not hunted, as Plato says, having nets spread\n for him by Alcibiades. And indeed, he laments without ceasing, being, as I\n suppose, unsuccessful in his love. For Aspasia, seeing in what a condition he was,\n says\u2014 \n Why weep you, my dear Socrates? does love \n For that impracticable boy which dwells \n Within thy breast, and shoots from out his eyes, \n So far thy heart subdue? Did I in vain \n Engage to make him docile to thy suit \n And that he really did love Alcibiades Plato shows plainly in the\n Protagoras, although he was now little less than thirty years of age; for he\n speaks in this manner, 'Whence are you come from, O Socrates? It seems to\n me you are come from your pursuit of Alcibiades's beauty. And, indeed, the man,\n when I saw him the other day, appeared to me to be a handsome man; a man,\n indeed, O Socrates, as he may well be called, just as much so as we are; and he\n has a firmly grown beard.' ' Well, what of that? are not you an admirer of\n Homer, who said that the most beautiful season of life was that of a young man\n who began to have a beard? And that is just the age of which Alcibiades is\n now.' \n \n ","61":"\n But most philosophers are of such a disposition that they are more inclined to\n evil speaking than the Comic writers. Since both Aeschines, the pupil of Socrates,\n in his Telauges, attacks Critobulus the son of Crito. as an ignorant man, and one\n who lives in a sordid manner; and he attacks Telauges himself for wearing a cloak\n borrowed of a clothes' cleaner by the day for half an obol; and for being girt\n about with a skin, and for having his sandals fastened with rotten pieces of\n string. And as for Lysias the orator he laughs immoderately at him; and in his\n Aspasia, he calls Hipponicus, the son of Callias, a blockhead; and taking all the\n women of Ionia in a lump he calls them lascivious and covetous. But his Callias\n dwells upon the quarrel of Callias with his own father, and the absurd jokes of\n the sophist Prodicus and Anaxagoras. For he says that\n Prodicus had Theramenes for a pupil to finish his education; and that the other\n had Philoxenus, the son of Eryxis, and Ariphrades, the brother of Arignotus, the\n harp-player, wishing from the notorious impurity of life of the men who have been\n named and their general want of respectability and intemperance to leave the sort\n of education they received from their tutors to be inferred. But in his Axiochus\n he runs Alcibiades down with great bitterness, as a drunkard, and a man always\n running after other men's wives. \n ","62":"\n But Antisthenes, in the second of his treatises called Cyrus, abusing Alcibiades,\n says that he is a breaker of the laws, both with respect to women and with respect\n to every other part of his conduct in life; for he says that he had intrigued with\n a mother, and daughter, and sister, after the fashion of the Persians. And his\n Political Dialogue runs down the whole of the Athenian demagogues: and his\n Archelaus attacks Gorgias, the rhetorician; and his Aspasia attacks Xanthippus and\n Paralus, the sons of Pericles. For, as for one of them, he says that he is a\n companion of Archestratus, who is no better than a frequenter of houses of the\n worst possible fame; and the other he calls an acquaintance and intimate friend of\n Euphemus, who abused every one he met with vulgar and ill-mannered abuse. And\n nicknaming Plato Satho, in a witless and vulgar manner, he published a dialogue\n against him, to which he gave the same name as its title. \n For these men believe that there is no such thing as an honest counsellor, or a\n conscientious general, or a respectable sophist, or a poet worth listening to, or\n a reasonable people: but Socrates, who spent his time in loose houses with the\n flute-playing women of Aspasia, and who was always chatting with Piston the\n armourer, and who gave lessons to Theodote the courtesan, how she ought to make\n the most of her lovers, as Xenophon tells us in the second book of his\n Memorabilia, is the only wise man according to them; for they represent him as\n giving Theodote such rules as neither Nico the Samian, nor Callistrate the\n Lesbian, nor Phil\u00e6nis the Leucadian, nor even Pythonicus the Athenian, were ever\n acquainted with as charms to conciliate affection. And yet those people paid much\n attention to such things. And time would fail me if I were to be inclined to quote\n the attacks which philosophers have made on people; for, as\n the same Plato says, a regular crowd of Gorgons and Pegasi, and other monsters,\n keeps flowing in upon me in immense numbers, and of preposterous appearance, so\n that I will keep silence. \n ","63":"\n When Masurius had said this, and when all had admired his wisdom, after silence\n was restored Ulpian said,\u2014 You seem to me, O guests, to be overwhelmed with\n impetuous speeches which come upon you unexpectedly, and to be thoroughly soaked\n in unmixed wine;\u2014 \n For a man drinking wine, as a horse does water, \n Speaks like a Scythian, not knowing even koppa, \n But voiceless, lies immersed in a cask, \n And sleeps as if he'd drunk medicinal poppy; \n as says Parmeno the Byzantian. Have you been all turned into stone by the\n before-mentioned Gorgons? Concerning whom, that there really have been some\n animals who were the causes of men being turned into stone, Alexander the Myndian\n speaks at length, in the second book of his History of Beasts, saying\u2014 The\n Nomades in Libya (where it is born) call the animal named the Gorgon, 'The\n Looking-down:' and it is as most people say, conjecturing from its skin,\n something like a wild sheep; but as some say, it is like a calf. And they say\n that it has such a breath that it destroys every one who meets it; and that it\n has a mane let down from its forehead over its eyes, and when it has shaken it\n aside, which it does with difficulty by reason of it weight, and then looks out\n through it, it slays the man who is beheld by it, not by its breath, but by\n some natural violence which proceeds from its eyes. And it was discovered in\n this way: Some of the soldiers of Marius, in his expedition against Jugurtha,\n having beheld the Gorgon, thought because it held its head down, and moved\n slowly, that it was a wild sheep, and in consequence they rushed upon it,\n intending to kill it with the swords which they had about them; but it, being\n disturbed, shaking aside the mane which hung down over its eyes, immediately\n caused the death of those who were rushing upon it. And when others again and\n again did the same thing, and lost their lives by so doing, and when all ho\n proceeded against it were invariably killed, some of the soldiers inquired the\n nature of the animal from the natives; and by the command of Marius some Nomad\n horsemen laid an ambush against it from a distance, and\n shot it with darts, and returned to the camp, bringing the dead monster to the\n general. And that this account is the true one, the skin and the\n expedition of Marius both prove. But the statement made by the historian is not\n credible, namely, that there are in Libya some oxen which are called\n Opisthonomi, because they do not advance while feeding,\n but feed constantly returning backwards, for their horns are a hindrance to their\n feeding in the natural manner, inasmuch as they are not bent upwards, as is the\n case with all other animals, but they bend downwards and overshadow the eyes; for\n this is incredible, since no other historian testifies to such a circumstance. \n ","64":"\n When Ulpian had said this, Laurentius bearing witness to the truth of his\n statement, and adding something to his speech, said, that Marius sent the skins of\n these animals to Rome, and that no one could conjecture to what animal they\n belonged, on account of the singular appearance which they presented; and that\n these skins were hung up in the temple of Hercules, in which the generals who\n celebrate a triumph give a banquet to the citizens, as many poets and historians\n of our nation have related. You then, O grammarians, as the Babylonian Herodicus\n says, inquiring into none of these matters\u2014 \n Fly ye to Greece along the sea's wide back, \n Pupils of Aristarchus, all more timid \n Than the pale antelope, worms hid in holes, \n Monosyllabic animals, who care \n For \u03c3\u03c6\u1f76\u03bd, and \u03c3\u03c6\u1ff6\u03b9\u03bd, and for \u03bc\u1f76\u03bd, and\n \u03bd\u1f76\u03bd, \n \n This shall be your lot, grumblers\u2014but let Greece \n And sacred Babylon receive Herodicus. \n For, as Anaxandrides the comic writer says\u2014 \n 'Tis sweet when one has plann'd a new device, \n To tell it to the world. For those who are \n Wise for themselves alone have, first of all, \n No judge to criticize their new invention. \n And envy is their portion too: for all, \n That seems to be commended by its novelty, \n Should be imparted freely to the people. \n And when this conversation had terminated, most of the guests took their\n departure secretly, and so broke up the party. \n "},"5":{"0":"\n SINCE you ask me every time that you meet me, my friend Timocrates, what was said\n by the Deipnosophists, thinking that we are making some discoveries, we will\n remind you of what is said by Antiphanes, in his Poesy, in this manner\u2014 \n In every way, my friends, is Tragedy \n A happy poem. For the argument \n Is, in the first place, known to the spectators, \n Before one single actor says a word. \n So that the poet need do little more \n Than just remind his hearers what they know. \n For should I speak of \u0152dipus, at once \n They recollect his story\u2014how his father \n Was Laius, and Jocasta too his mother; \n What were his sons', and what his daughters' names, \n And what he did and suffer'd. So again \n If a man names Alcm\u00e6on, the very children \n Can tell you how he in his madness slew \n His mother; and Adrastus furious, \n Will come in haste, and then depart again; \n And then at last, when they can say no more, \n And when the subject is almost exhausted, \n They lift an engine easily as a finger, \n And that is quite enough to please the theatre. \n But our case is harder. We are forced \n T' invent the whole of what we write; new names, \n Things done before, done now, new plots, new openings, \n And new catastrophes. And if we fail in aught, \n Some Chremes or some Phido hisses us. \n While Peleus is constrain'd by no such laws, \n Nor Teucer. \n And Diphilus says, in his Men conducting Helen\u2014 \n O thou who rulest, patroness and queen, \n Over this holy spot of sacred Brauron, \n Bow-bearing daughter of Latona and Jove, \n As the tragedians call you; who alone \n Have power to do and say whate'er they please. \n \n \n ","1":"\n But Timocles the comic writer, asserting that tragedy is \n useful in many respects to human life, says in his Women celebrating the Festival\n of Bacchus\u2014 \n My friend, just hear what I'm about to say. \n Man is an animal by nature miserable; \n And life has many grievous things in it. \n Therefore he has invented these reliefs \n To ease his cares; for oft the mind forgets \n Its own discomforts while it soothes itself \n In contemplation of another's woes, \n And e'en derives some pleasure and instruction. \n For first, I'd have you notice the tragedians; \n What good they do to every one. The poor man \n Sees Telephus was poorer still than he, \n And bears his own distress more easily. \n The madman thinks upon Alcm\u00e6on's case. \n Has a man weak sore eyes? The sons of Phineus \n Are blind as bats. Has a man lost his child \n Let him remember childless Niobe. \n He's hurt his leg; and so had Philoctetes. \n Is he unfortunate in his old age? \n \u0152neus was more so. So that every one, \n Seeing that others have been more unfortunate, \n Learns his own griefs to bear with more content. \n \n \n ","2":"\n And we accordingly, O Timocrates, will restore to you the\n relics of the feast of the Deipnosophists, and will not give them, as Cothocides the orator said, meaning to ridicule\n Demosthenes, who, when Philip gave Halonnesus to the Athenians, advised them\n not to take it if he gave it, but only if he restored it. And this sentence Antiphanes jested\n upon in his Neottis, where he ridicules it in this manner\u2014 \n My master has received ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03bd ) as he took\n ( \u1f14\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03bd ) \n His patrimonial inheritance. \n How would these words have pleased Demosthenes! \n And Alexis says, in his Soldier\u2014 \n \n A. Receive this thing. \n \n B. What is it \n \n A. Why the child \n Which I had from you, which I now bring back. \n \n B. Why? will you no more keep him? \n \n A. He's not mine. \n \n B. Nor mine. \n \n A. But you it was who gave him me. \n \n B. I gave him not. \n \n A. How so? \n \n B. I but restored him. \n \n A. You gave me what I never need have taken. \n \n And in his Brothers he says\u2014 \n \n A. For did I give them anything? Tell me that. \n \n B. No, you restored it, holding a deposit. \n And Anaxilas, in his Evandria, says\u2014 \n . . . . Give it not, \n Only restore it. \n \n B. Here I now have brought it. \n And Timocles says in his Heroes\u2014 \n \n A. You bid me now to speak of everything \n Rather than what is to the purpose; well, \n I'll gratify you so far. \n \n B. You shall find \n As the first fruits that you have pacified \n The great Demosthenes. \n \n A. But who is he? \n \n B. That Briareus who swallows spears and\n shields; \n A man who hates all quibbles; never uses \n Antithesis nor trope; but from his eyes \n Glares terrible Mars. \n According, therefore, to the above-mentioned poets, so we, restoring but not giving to you\n what followed after the previous conversation, will now tell you all that was said\n afterwards. \n ","3":"\n Then came into us these servants, bringing a great quantity of sea fish and lake\n fish on silver platters, so that we marvelled at the wealth displayed, and at the\n costliness of the entertainment, which was such that he seemed almost to have\n engaged the Nereids themselves as the purveyors. And one of the parasites and\n flatterers said that Neptune was sending fish to our Neptunian port, not by the\n agency of those who at Rome sell rare fish for their weight in money; but that\n some were imported from Antium, and some from Terracina, and some from the Pontian\n islands opposite, and some from Pyrgi; and that is a city of Etruria. For the\n fishmongers in Rome are very little different from those who used to be turned\n into ridicule by the comic poets at Athens, of whom Antiphanes says, in his Young\n Men\u2014 \n I did indeed for a long time believe \n The Gorgons an invention of the poets, \n But when I came into the fish-market \n I quickly found them a reality. \n For looking at the fish women I felt \n Turn'd instantly to stone, and was compelled \n To turn away my head while talking to them. \n For when I see how high a price they ask, \n And for what little fish, I'm motionless. \n \n \n \n ","4":"\n And Amphis says in his Impostor\u2014 \n 'Tis easier to get access to the general, \n And one is met by language far more courteous, \n And by more civil answer from his grace, \n Than from those cursed fishfags in the market. \n For when one asks them anything, or offers \n To buy aught of them, mute they stand like Telephus, \n And just as stubborn; ('tis an apt comparison, \n For in a word they all are homicides;) \n And neither listen nor appear to heed, \n But shake a dirty polypus in your face; \n Or else turn sulky, and scarce say a word, \n But as if half a syllable were enough, \n Say se'n s'lings this, \n this turb't eight'n-pence. \n \n This is the treatment which a man must bear \n Who seeks to buy a dinner in the fish-market. \n And Alexis says in his Apeglaucomenos\u2014 \n When I behold a general looking stern, \n I think him wrong, but do not greatly wonder, \n That one in high command should think himself \n Above the common herd. But when I see \n The fishmongers, of all tribes far the worst, \n Bending their sulky eyes down to the ground, \n And lifting up their eyebrows to their foreheads, \n I am disgusted. And if you should ask, \n \n Tell me, I pray you, what's this pair of mullets? \n \n \n Tenpence. \n Oh, that's too much; you'll eightpence take \n \n \n Yes, if you'll be content with half the pair. \n \n \n Come, eightpence; that is plenty. \"I will not \n Take half a farthing less: don't waste my time.\" \n Is it not bitter to endure such insolence? \n \n \n ","5":"\n And Diphilus says in his Busybody\u2014 \n I used to think the race of fishmongers \n Was only insolent in Attica; \n But now I see that like wild beasts they are \n Savage by nature, everywhere the same. \n But here is one who goes beyond his fellows, \n Nourishing flowing hair, which he doth call \n Devoted to his god-though that is not the reason, \n But he doth use it as a veil to hide \n The brand which marks his forehead. Should you ask him, \n What is this pike's price? he will tell you tenpence; \n \n Not say what pence he means; then if you give him \n The money, he will claim Aegina's coinage; \n While if you ask for change, he'll give you Attic. \n And thus he makes a profit on both sides. \n And Xenarchus says in his Purple\u2014 \n \n Poets are nonsense; for they never say \n A single thing that's new. But all they do \n Is to clothe old ideas in language new, \n Turning the same things o'er and o'er again, \n And upside down. But as to fishmongers, \n They're an inventive race, and yield to none \n In shameless conduct. For as modern laws \n Forbid them now to water their stale fish, \n Some fellow, hated by the gods, beholding \n His fish quite dry, picks with his mates a quarrel, \n And blows are interchanged. Then when one thinks \n He's had enough, he falls, and seems to faint, \n And lies like any corpse among his baskets. \n Some one calls out for water; and his partner \n Catches a pail, and throws it o'er his friend \n So as to sprinkle all his fish, and make \n The world believe them newly caught and fresh. \n \n \n ","6":"\n And that they often do sell fish which is dead stinking is proved by what\n Antiphanes says in his Adulterers, as follows\u2014 \n There's not on earth a more unlucky beast \n Than a poor fish, for whom 'tis not enough \n To die when caught, that they may find at once \n A grave in human stomachs; but what's worse, \n They fall into the hands of odious fishmongers, \n And rot and lie upon their stalls for days; \n And if they meet with some blind purchaser, \n He scarce can carry them when dead away; \n But throws them out of doors, and thinks that he \n Has through his nose had taste enough of them. \n And in his Friend of the Thebans he say\u2014 \n Is it not quite a shame, that if a man \n Has fresh-caught fish to sell, he will not speak \n To any customer without a frown \n Upon his face, and language insolent \n And if his fish are stale, he jokes and laughs- \n While his behaviour should the contrary be; \n The first might laugh, the latter should be shamed. \n And that they sell their fish very dear we are told by Alexis in his\n Pyl\u00e6an Women\u2014 \n Yes, by Minerva, I do marvel at \n The tribe of fishmongers, that they are not \n All wealthy men, such royal gains they make. \n For sitting in the market they do think it \n A trifling thing to tithe our properties; \n But would take all at one fell swoop away. \n \n \n ","7":"\n And the same poet says in his play entitled the Caldron\u2014 \n \n There never was a better lawgiver \n Than rich Aristonicus. For he now \n Does make this law, that any fishmonger \n Who puts a price upon his fish, and then \n Sells it for less, shall be at once dragg'd off \n And put in prison; that by their example \n The rest may learn to ask a moderate price, \n And be content with that, and carry home \n Their rotten fish each evening; and then \n Old men, old women, boys, and all their customers, \n Will buy whatever suits them at fair price. \n And a little further on he says\u2014 \n There never has, since Solon's time, been seen \n A better lawgiver than Aristonicus. \n For he has given many different laws, \n And now he introduces this new statute, \n A golden statute, that no fishmonger \n Should sell his fish while sitting, but that all \n Shall stand all day i' the market. And he says \n Next year he will enact that they shall sell \n Being hung up; for so they will let off \n Their customers more easily, when they \n Are raised by a machine like gods in a play. \n \n \n ","8":"\n And Antiphanes, in his Hater of Wickedness, displays their rudeness and\n dishonesty, comparing them to the greatest criminals who exist among men, speaking\n as follows\u2014 \n Are not the Scythians of men the wisest? \n Who when their children are first born do give them \n The milk of mares and cows to drink at once, \n And do not trust them to dishonest nurses, \n Or tutors, who of evils are the worst, \n Except the midwives only. For that class \n Is worst of all, and next to them do come \n The begging priests of mighty Cybele; \n And it is hard to find a baser lot- \n Unless indeed you speak of fishmongers, \n But they are worse than even money-changers, \n And are in fact the worst of all mankind. \n \n \n ","9":"\n And it was not without some wit that Diphilus, in his Merchant, speaks in this\n manner of fish being sold at an exorbitant price\u2014 \n I never heard of dearer fish at any time. \n Oh, Neptune, if you only got a tenth \n Of all that money, you would be by far \n The richest of the gods! And yet if he, \n The fishmonger I mean, had been but civil, \n I would have given him his price, though grumbling; \n And, just as Priam ransom'd Hector, I \n Would have put down his weight to buy the conger. \n \n And Alexis says in his Grecian Woman\u2014 \n Living and dead, the monsters of the deep \n Are hostile to us always. If our ship \n Be overturn'd, they then at once devour \n Whatever of the crew they catch while swimming: \n And if they're caught themselves by fishermen, \n When dead they half undo their purchasers; \n For with our whole estate they must be bought, \n And the sad purchaser comes off a beggar. \n And Archippus, in his play called the Fish, mentions one fishmonger by\n name, Herm\u00e6us the Egyptian, saying\u2014 \n The cursedest of all fish-dealers is \n Herm\u00e6us the Egyptian; who skins \n And disembowels all the vilest fish, \n And sells them for the choicest, as I hear. \n And Alexis, in his Rich Heiress, mentions a certain fishmonger by name,\n Micio. \n ","10":"\n And perhaps it is natural for fishermen to be proud of their skill, even to a\n greater degree than the most skilful generals. Accordingly, Anaxandrides, in his\n Ulysses, introduces one of them, speaking in this way of the fisherman's art\u2014\n \n The beauteous handiwork of portrait painters \n When in a picture seen is much admired; \n But the fair fruit of our best skill is seen \n In a rich dish just taken from the frying-pan. \n For by what other art, my friend, do we \n See young men's appetites so much inflamed? \n What causes such outstretching of the hands \n What is so apt to choke one, if a man. \n Can hardly swallow it? Does not the fish-market \n Alone give zest to banquets Who can spread \n A dinner without fried fish, or anchovies, \n Or high-priced mullet? With what words or charms \n Can a well-favour'd youth be caught, if once \n The fisherman's assistance be denied? \n His art subdues him, bringing to the fish-kettle \n The heads of well-boil'd fish; this leads him on \n To doors which guard th' approach to a good dinner, \n And bids him haste, though nought himself contributing. \n \n \n ","11":"\n And Alexis says this with reference to those who are too anxious as to buying\n their fish, in his Rich Heiress\u2014 \n Whoever being poor buys costly fish, \n And though in want of much, in this is lavish, \n He strips by night whoever he may meet. \n So when a man is stripp'd thus, let him go \n \n At early morn and watch the fish-market. \n And the first man he sees both poor and young \n Buying his eels of Micio, let him seize him, \n And drag him off to prison by the throat. \n And Diphilus, in his Merchant, says that there is some such law as this\n in existence among the Corinthians\u2014 \n \n A. This is an admirable law at Corinth, \n That when we see a man from time to time \n Purveying largely for his table, we \n Should ask him whence he comes, and what's his business: \n And if he be a man of property, \n Whose revenues can his expenses meet, \n Then we may let him as he will enjoy himself. \n But if he do his income much exceed, \n Then they bid him desist from such a course, \n And fix a fine on all who disobey. \n And if a man having no means at all \n Still lives in splendid fashion, him they give \n Unto the gaoler. \n \n B. Hercules! what a law. \n \n A. For such a man can't live without some crime. \n Dost thou not see? He must rove out by night \n And rob, break into houses, or else share \n With some who do so. Or he must haunt the forum, \n A vile informer, or be always ready \n As a hired witness. And this tribe we hate, \n And gladly would expel from this our city. \n \n B. And you'd do well, by Jove; but what is that to\n me? \n \n A. Because we see you every day, my friend, \n Making not moderate but extravagant purchases. \n You hinder all the rest from buying fish, \n And drive the city to the greengrocer, \n And so we fight for parsley like the combatants \n At Neptune's games on th' Isthmus. . Does a hare \n Come to the market? it is yours; a thrush \n Or partridge? all do go the selfsame way. \n So that we cannot buy or fish or fowl; \n And you have raised the price of foreign wine. \n And Sophilus, in his Androcles, wishes that the same custom prevailed at\n Athens also, thinking that it would be a good thing if two or three men were\n appointed by the city to the regulation of the provision markets.

For before the reign of this monarch Apollo had no\n silver, and still less had he gold, as Phanias the Eresian\n tells us, and Theopompus, too, in the fortieth book of his History of the\n Transactions of the Reign of Philip. For these writers relate that the Pythian\n temple was adorned by Gyges, and by Cr\u0153sus who succeeded him; and after them by\n Gelo and Hiero, the tyrants of Syracuse: the first of whom offered up a tripod and\n a statue of Victory, both made of gold, about the time that Xerxes was making his\n expedition against Greece; and Hiero made similar offerings. And Theopompus uses\n the following language\u2014 For anciently the temple was adorned with brazen\n offerings: I do not mean statues, but caldrons and tripods made of brass. The\n Laced\u00e6monians, therefore, wishing to gild the face of the Apollo that was at\n Amycl\u00e6, and not finding any gold in Greece, having sent to the oracle of the\n god, asked the god from whom they could buy gold; and he answered them that\n they should go to Cr\u0153sus the Lydian, and buy it of him. And they went and\n bought the gold of Cr\u0153sus. But Hiero the Syracusan, wishing to offer to the god\n a tripod and a statue of Victory of unalloyed gold, and being in want of the\n gold for a long time, afterwards sent men to Greece to seek for it; who, coming\n after a time to Corinth, and tracing it out, found some in the possession of\n Architeles the Corinthian, who had been a long time buying it up by little and\n little, and so had no inconsiderable quantity of it; and he sold it to the\n emissaries of Hiero in what quantity they required. And after that, having\n filled his hand with it he made them a present of all that he could hold in his\n hand, in return for which Hiero sent a vessel full of corn, and many other\n gifts to him from Sicily. \n \n ","20":"\n And Phanias relates the same circumstances in his history of the Tyrants in\n Sicily, saying that the ancient offerings had been brass, both tripods, and\n caldrons, and daggers; and that on one of them there was the following\n inscription\u2014 \n Look on me well; for I was once a part \n Of the wide tower which defended Troy \n When Greeks and Trojans fought for fair-hair'd Helen; \n And Helicon, brave Antenor's son, \n Brought me from thence, and placed me here, to be \n An ornament to Ph\u0153bus' holy shrine. \n And in the tripod, which was one of the prizes offered at the funeral\n games in honour of Patroclus, there was the inscription\u2014 \n \n I am a brazen tripod, and I lie \n Here as an ornament of Delphi's shrine. \n The swift Achilles gave me as a prize \n What time he placed Patroclus on the pile, \n And Tydeus' mighty son, brave Diomede, \n Offer'd me here, won by his speedy coursers \n In the swift race by Helle's spacious wave. \n \n \n ","21":"\n And Ephorus, or Demophilus, his son, in the thirtieth book of his Histories,\n speaking of the temple of Delphi, says, \"But Onomarchus and Phayllus and Phal\u00e6cus\n not only carried off all the treasures of the god, but at last their wives carried\n off also the ornaments of Eriphyle, which Alcm\u00e6on consecrated at Delphi by the\n command of the god and also the necklace of Helen, which had been given by\n Menelaus. For the god had given each of them oracles: he had said to Alcm\u00e6on, when\n he asked him how he could be cured of his madness\u2014 \n You ask a precious gift, relief from madness'; \n Give me a precious gift yourself; the chain \n With which your mother buried, steeds and all, \n Your sire, her husband, brave Amphiaraus. \n And he replied to Menelaus, who consulted him as to how he might avenge\n himself on Paris\u2014 \n Bring me the golden ornament of the neck \n Of your false wife; which Venus once did give \n A welcome gift to Helen; and then Paris \n Shall glut your direst vengeance by his fall. \n And it so fell out that a violent quarrel arose among the women about\n these ornaments\u2014which should take which. And when they had drawn lots for the\n choice, the one of them, who was very ugly and stern, got Eriphyle's necklace, but\n the one who was conspicuous for beauty and wanton got the ornaments of Helen; and\n she, being in love with a young man of Epirus, went away with him, but the other\n contrived to put her husband to death. \n ","22":"\n But the divine Plato, and Lycurgus the Laced\u00e6monian, not only forbad all costly\n ornaments to be introduced into their model states, but they would not permit even\n silver or gold to be brought into them, thinking that of the products of mines,\n iron and copper were sufficient, and banishing the other metals as injurious to\n those states which were in good order. But Zeno the Stoic, thinking everything\n unimportant except the legitimate and honest use of the precious metals, forbad either praying for or deprecating them; but still he\n recommended chiefly the use of those which were more commonly accessible and less\n superfluous; in order that men, having the dispositions of their minds formed so\n as neither to fear nor to admire anything which is not honourable on the one hand\n or discreditable on the other, should use only what is natural as much as\n possible, and yet should not fear what is of an opposite character, but abstain\n from such in obedience to reason and not to fear. For nature has not banished any\n of the above-mentioned things out of the world, but has made subterranean veins of\n these metals, the working of which is very laborious and difficult, in order that\n they who desire such things may arrive at the acquisition after toil and\n suffering; and that not only those men themselves who work in the mines, but those\n also who collect what has been extracted from the mines, may acquire this much\n wished for opulence at the expense of countless labours. \n Therefore a little of these metals lies on the surface just to serve as a sample\n of the rest which is beneath, since in the remotest corners of the earth also\n there are rivers bearing down gold-dust in their waters; and women and men\n destitute of bodily strength scratching among the sand, detach these particles\n from the sand, and then they wash them and bring them to the smelting-pot, as my\n countryman Posidonius says is done among the Helvetians, and among others of the\n Celtic tribes. And the mountains which used formerly to be called the Rhipeean\n mountains, and which were subsequently named the Olbian (as if happy), and which\n are now called the Alps, (they are mountains in Gaul,) when once the woods upon\n them had caught fire spontaneously, ran with liquid silver. The greater quantity\n of this metal, however, is found by mining operations carried on at a great depth,\n and attended by great hardship, according to the statement of Demetrius Phalereus,\n in consequence of the desire of avarice to draw Pluto himself out of the recesses\n of the earth; and, accordingly, he says facetiously that\u2014 Men having often\n abandoned what was visible for the sake of what was uncertain, have not got\n what they expected, and have lost what they had, being unfortunate by an\n enigmatical sort of calamity. \n \n ","23":"\n But the Laced\u00e6monians being hindered by their national institutions from\n introducing silver or gold into Sparta, as the same\n Posidonius relates, or from possessing any in private, did possess it\n nevertheless, but then they deposited it among their neighbours the Arcadians. But\n subsequently the Arcadians became enemies to them instead of friends, as they had\n been; picking a quarrel with them with the express view of seizing on this deposit\n without being called to account for it, by reason of the enmity now subsisting.\n Therefore it is said that the gold and silver which had formerly been at Laced\u00e6mon\n was consecrated at Delphi to Apollo; and that when Lysander brought gold publicly\n into the city he was the cause of many evils to the state by so doing. And it is\n said that Gylippus, who delivered the Syracusans, was put to death by starvation,\n having been condemned by the Ephori, because he had embezzled some of the money\n sent to Sparta by Lysander. But that which had been devoted to the god and been\n granted to the people as a public ornament and public property, it was not decent\n for any mortal to treat with contempt. \n ","24":"\n But that tribe of Gauls which is called the Cordist\u00e6, does not introduce gold into\n their country either, still they are not the less ready to plunder the territories\n of their neighbours, and to commit injustice; and that nation is a remnant of the\n Gauls who formed the army of Brennus when he made his expedition against the\n temple of Delphi. And a certain Bathanatius, acting as their leader, settled them\n as a colony in the districts around the Ister, from whom they call the road by\n which they returned the Bathanatian road, and even to this day they call his\n posterity the Bathanati. And these men proscribe gold, and do not introduce it\n into their territories, as a thing on account of which they have suffered many\n calamities; but they do use silver, and for the sake of that they commit the most\n enormous atrocities. Although the proper course would be, not to banish the whole\n class of the thing of which they were formerly plundered, but the impiety which\n could perpetrate such a sacrilege. And even if they did not introduce silver into\n their country, still they would commit excesses in the pursuit of copper and iron;\n and even if they had not these things, still they would continue to rage in war\n against other nations for the sake of meat and drink, and other necessaries. \n ","25":"\n When Pontianus had delivered his opinion in these terms, and\n while most of the guests were endeavouring to solve the questions proposed by\n Ulpian, Plutarch, being one of those who was attending to the other subjects of\n discussion, said,\u2014The name parasite was in former days a respectable and a holy\n name. At all events, Polemo (whether he was a Samian or a Sicyonian, or whether he\n prefers the name of an Athenian, which Heraclides the Mopseatian gives him, who\n also speaks of him as being claimed by other cities; and he was also called\n Stelocopas, as Herodicus the Cratetian has told us,) writing about parasites,\n speaks as follows\u2014 The name of parasite is now a disreputable one; but among\n the ancients we find the word parasite used as something sacred, and nearly\n equivalent to the title Messmate. Accordingly, at Cynosarges, in the temple of\n Hercules, there is a pillar on which is engraven a decree of Alcibiades; the\n clerk who drew it up being Stephanus the son of Thucydides; and in it mention\n is made of this name in the following terms\u2014' Let the priest perform the\n monthly sacrifices with the parasites; and let the parasites select one\n bastard, and one of the sons of the same, according to the usual national\n customs; and whoever is unwilling to take the place of a parasite, let the\n priest report him to the tribunal.' And in the tables of the laws concerning\n the Deliast\u00e6 it is written\u2014' And let two heralds, of the family of the heralds,\n of that branch of it which is occupied about the sacred mysteries, be chosen;\n and let them be parasites in the temple of Delos for a year.' And in Pallenis\n this inscription is engraved on the offerings there found\u2014' The Archons and\n parasites made these offerings, who, in the archonship of Pythodorus, were\n crowned with a golden crown; and the parasites were, in the\n archonship of Lycostratus, Gargettius; in the archonship of Pericletus,\n Pericles Pitheus; in that of Demochares, Charinus.' And in the laws of the\n king, we find the following words\u2014' That the parasites of the Acharnensians\n shall sacrifice to Apollo.' But Clearchus the Solensian, and he was one of the\n disciples of Aristotle, in the first book of his Lives, writes thus-'But now\n they call a parasite. a man who is ready for anything; but in former times he\n was a man picked out as a companion.' Accordingly, in the ancient laws,\n most cities mention parasites among the most honourable of their officers; and, indeed, they do so to this day. And Clidemus\n says in his Attic Women\u2014 \n And then they chose some parasites for Hercules. \n And Themiso, in his Pallenis, says\u2014 That the king, who from time to\n time fills that office, and the parasites, whom they appoint from the main body\n of the people, and the old men, and the women who still have their first\n husbands, shall take care of such and such things. \n \n ","26":"\n And from this you perceive, my good friend Ulpian, that you may raise another\n question, who the women are who still have their first husbands? But (for we are\n still speaking about the parasites) there is also an inscription on a pillar in\n the Anaceum to the following effect\u2014 Of the best bulls which are selected,\n one-third is to be appropriated to the games; and of the remaining two-thirds,\n one is to go to the priest, and the other to the parasites. But Crates,\n in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect, says\u2014 And the word\n parasite is now used in a disreputable sense; but formerly those people were\n called parasites who were selected to collect the sacred corn, and there was a\n regular Hall of the parasites; on which account the following expressions occur\n in the law of the king\u2014 That the king shall take care of the Archons\n that they are properly appointed, and that they shall select the parasites from\n the different boroughs, according to the statutes enacted with reference to that\n subject. And that the parasites shall, without any evasion or fraud, select from\n their own share a sixth part of a bushel of barley, on which all who are citizens\n of Athens shall feast in the temple, according to the national laws and customs.\n And that the parasites of the Acharnensians shall give a sixth part of a bushel\n from their collection of barley to the guild of priests of Apollo. And that there\n was a regular Hall for the parasites is shown by the following expressions in the\n same law\u2014 For the repairs of the temple, and of the magistrates' hall, and\n of the hall of parasites, and of the sacred house, they shall pay whatever sums\n of money the contractors appointed by the priests think necessary. From\n this it is evident that the place in which the parasites laid up the first-fruits\n of the consecrated corn was called the Parasitium, or the Hall of the\n parasites. \n \n And Philochorus gives the same account in his book entitled the Tetrapolis, where\n he mentions the parasites who were elected for the temple of Hercules; and\n Diodorus of Sinope, a comic poet, in his Heir, (from which I will cite some\n testimonies presently,) says the same. And Aristotle, in his treatise on the\n Constitution of the Methoneans, says\u2014 Parasites were two in number for each\n of the archons, and one for the polemarchs. And they received a fixed allowance\n from others, and they also took dishes of fish from the fishermen. \n \n ","27":"\n But the meaning which is now given to the name parasite is one which Carystius of\n Pergamus, in his treatise on the Didascali$e, says was first invented by Alexis,\n forgetting that Epicharmus, in his Hope or Plutus, has introduced one in a\n drinking party, where he says\u2014 \n But here another stands at this man's feet, \n * * * * * * \n Seeking for food which shall not cost him anything, \n And he will drink up an entire cask, \n As if it were a cupfull. \n And he introduces the parasite himself, making the following speech to\n some one who questioned him\u2014 \n I sup with any one who likes, if he \n Has only got the good sense to invite me; \n And with each man who makes a marriage feast, \n Whether I'm asked or not, there I am witty; \n There I make others laugh, and there I praise \n The host, who gives the feast. And if by chance \n Any one dares to say a word against him, \n I arm myself for contest, and o'erwhelm him. \n Then eating much and drinking plentifully, \n I leave the house. No link-boy doth attend me; \n But I do pick my way with stumbling steps, \n Both dark and desolate; and if sometimes \n I do the watchmen meet, I swear to them \n By all the gods that I have done no wrong; \n But still they set on me. At last, well beaten, \n I reach my home, and go to sleep on the ground, \n And for a while forget my blows and bruises, \n While the strong wine retains its sway and lulls me. \n \n \n ","28":"\n And the parasite of Epicharmus makes a second speech of the same kind. And a\n parasite of Diphilus speaks thus\u2014 \n When a rich man who gives a dinner asks me, \n I look not at the ceiling or the cornices, \n Nor do I criticise Corinthian chasings, \n But keep my eyes fixed on the kitchen smoke, \n \n And if it goes up strong and straight to heaven, \n I joy and triumph, and I clap my wings; \n But it be but thin and moving sidewise, \n Then I perceive my feast too will be thin. \n But Homer is the first person, as some say, who introduced the character\n of a parasite, saying of Podes that he was a beloved guest of Hector\u2014 \n There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame, \n Eetion's son, and Podes was his name,\u2014 \n With riches honour'd, and with courage blest, \n By Hector loved, his comrade and his guest. \n \n For the word \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 comes to the same\n thing as \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, on which account he makes him\n wounded by Menelaus in the belly, as Demetrius the Scepsian says; as also he\n represents Pandarus as wounded in the tongue, because of his having perjured\n himself; and it is a Spartan who wounds him, one of a nation very much devoted to\n temperance. \n ","29":"\n But the ancient poets called parasites flatterers; from whom also Eupolis gave\n this title to his play, where he represents a chorus of flatterers speaking thus\u2014\n \n But we will tell you now \n The mode of life adopted \n By the whole flattering band, \n And listen ye, and learn \n How well-bred we all are. \n For first of all a boy, \n Another person's slave, \n Attends us; and we are \n Content with very little. \n I have two well-made garments, \n And always have one on; \n I hie me to the forum, \n And when I see a man, \n A foolish man but rich, \n I make my way to him, \n And if he says a word \n I praise his wit and laugh, \n Delighted at his jests. \n And then we go to supper, \n My friends and I, pursuing \n Each different game so long \n As we can save our money. \n And then the parasite \n Must show his wit and manners, \n Or out of doors be turned. \n And one there was, Acestor, \n \n A branded slave, if I \n Am bound to tell the truth, \n And he was treated so. \n For not one single joke \n Did he ope his lips to utter, \n And so the slaves expell'd \n And pilloried the knave, \n And gave him up to \u0152neus. \n \n \n ","30":"\n And Araros, in his Hymen\u00e6us, uses the word parasite, where he says\u2014 \n Why you must be a parasite, my friend; \n And 'tis Ischomachus who does support you. \n And the word is constantly used among the later writers. And the verb\n \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9, to be a parasite, occurs in Plato\n the comic writer, in his Laches. For he says\u2014 \n See how these youths do play the parasite. \n And Alexis says that there are two kinds of parasites, in his Pilot,\n where we find this passage\u2014 \n \n A. There are two kinds of parasites, Nausinicos: \n The one the common one, much jested on \n By comic writers, we, the blackfaced men \n \n N. What is the other kind? \n \n A. Satraps of parasites; \n Illustrious leaders of the band; a troop \n Whom you may call the venerable parasites; \n Men who act well throughout their lives; \n Knit their brows gravely, win estates and legacies. \n Know'st thou the kind of men, and these their manners? \n \n N. Indeed I do. \n \n A. Each of these men have one \n Fix'd method of proceeding, flattery; \n And as in life, fortune makes some men great, \n And bids the rest content themselves with little; \n So some of us do thrive, and some do fail. \n Do I not make the matter plain to you \n \n N. Why if I praise you, you will ask for more. \n \n \n ","31":"\n And Timocles, in his Dracontius, hits off the parasite very neatly, and describes\n his character thus\u2014 \n Shall I then let a man abuse the parasites? \n No, surely, for there is no race of men \n More useful in such matters. And if company \n Be one of the things which makes life pass agreeably, \n Surely a parasite does this most constantly. \n Are you in love? he, at the shortest notice, \n Feels the same passion. Have you any business \n His business is at once the same as yours; \n And he's at hand to help you as you wish; \n Thinking that only fair to him that feeds him. \n 'Tis marvellous how he doth praise his friends\u2014 \n \n He loves a feast where he is ask'd for nothing. \n What man, what hero, or what god exists, \n Who does not scorn such habits and such principles? \n But that I mayn't detain you all the day, \n I think that I can give you one clear proof \n In what respect men hold a parasite; \n For they receive the same rewards as those \n Who at Olympia bear the palm of victory\u2014 \n They both are fed for nothing for their virtues; \n And wheresoe'er there is no contribution, \n That place we ought to call the Prytaneum. \n \n \n ","32":"\n And Antiphanes, in his Twins, says\u2014 \n For look, the parasite, if you judge aright, \n Shares both the life and fortune of his friends. \n There is no parasite who'd wish his friends \n To be unfortunate; but on the contrary \n His constant prayer will be, that all may prosper. \n Has any one a fortune? he don't envy him; \n He'd rather always be at hand to share it. \n He is a genuine friend, and eke a safe one, \n Not quarrelsome, ill-humour'd, peevish, sulky, \n But skill'd to keep his temper. Do you mock him? \n He laughs himself; he's amorous or mirthful, \n Just as his friend is i' th' humour. He's a general, \n Or valiant soldier, only let his pay \n Be a good dinner, and he'll ask no more. \n \n \n ","33":"\n And Aristophon, in his Physician, says\u2014 \n I wish now to inform him \n What is my disposition. \n If any one gives a dinner, \n I'm always to be found, \n So that the young men scoffing \n Because I come in first \n Do call me gravy soup. \n Then if there be occasion \n To check a drunken guest, \n Or turn him out by force, \n You'd think I were Ant\u00e6us; \n Or must a door be forced? \n I butt like any ram; \n Or would you scale a ladder? \n I'm Capaneus, and eager \n To climb like him to heaven. \n Are blows to be endured? \n A very anvil I; \n Or Telamon or Ajax, \n If wounds are to be given; \n While as a beauty-hunter \n E'en smoke itself can't beat me. \n \n \n And in his Pythagorean he says\u2014 \n For being hungry, and yet eating nothing, \n He is a Tithymallus or Philippides; \n For water-drinking he's a regular frog; \n For eating thyme and cabbages, a snail; \n For hating washing he's a pig; for living \n Out in the open air, a perfect blackbird; \n For standing cold and chattering all the day, \n A second grasshopper; in hating oil \n He's dust; for walking barefoot in the morning, \n A crane; for passing sleepless nights, a bat. \n \n \n ","34":"\n And Antiphanes says in his Ancestors\u2014 \n You know my ways; \n That there's no pride in me, but I am just \n Like this among my friends: a mass of iron \n To bear their blows, a thunderbolt to give them; \n Lightning to blind a man, the wind to move one; \n A very halter, if one needs be choked; \n An earthquake to heave doors from off their hinges; \n A flea to leap quick in; a fly to come \n And feast without a formal invitation; \n Not to depart too soon, a perfect well. \n I'm ready when I'm wanted, whether it be \n To choke a man or kill him, or to prove \n A case against him. All that others say, \n Those things I am prepared at once to do. \n And young men, mocking me on this account, \n Do call me whirlwind\u2014but for me, I care not \n For such light jests. For to my friends I prove \n A friend in deeds, and not in words alone. \n But Diphilus in his Parasite, when a wedding-feast is about to take\n place, represents the parasite as speaking thus\u2014 \n Do you not know that in the form of curse \n These words are found, If any one do fail \n To point the right road to a traveller, \n To quench a fire; or if any one spoil \n The water of a spring or well, or hinders \n A guest upon his way when going to supper? \n And Eubulus says in his \u0152dipus\u2014 \n The man who first devised the plan of feasting \n At other folk's expense, must sure have been \n A gentleman of very popular manners; \n But he who ask'd a friend or any stranger \n To dinner, and then made him bear his share, \n May he be banish'd, and his goods all seized. \n \n \n ","35":"\n And Diodorus of Sinope, in his Orphan Heiress, has these expressions, when\n speaking of a parasite, and they are not devoid of elegance\u2014 \n \n I wish to show and prove beyond a doubt \n How reputable, and how usual too, \n This practice is; a most divine contrivance. \n Other arts needed not the gods to teach them; \n Wise men invented them; but Jove himself \n Did teach his friends to live as parasites, \n And he confessedly is king o' the gods. \n For he does often to men's houses come, \n And cares not whether they be rich or poor; \n And wheresoe'er he sees a well-laid couch, \n And well-spread table near, supplied with all \n That's good or delicate, he sits him down, \n And asks himself to dinner, eats and drinks, \n And then goes home again, and pays no share. \n And I now do the same. For when I see \n Couches prepared, and handsome tables loaded, \n And the door open to receive the guests, \n I enter in at once, and make no noise, \n But trim myself, behaving quietly, \n To give no great annoyance to my neighbour, \n And then, when I have well enjoy'd the whole \n That's set before me, and when I have drunk \n Of delicate wines enough, I home return, \n Like friendly Jupiter. And that such a line \n Was always thought respectable and honest, \n I now will give you a sufficient proof. \n This city honours Hercules exceedingly, \n And sacrifices to him in all the boroughs, \n And at these sacred rites it ne'er admits \n The common men, or parasites, or beggars; \n But out of all the citizens it picks \n Twelve men of all the noblest families, \n All men of property and character; \n And then some rich men, imitating Hercules, \n Select some parasites, not choosing those \n Who are the wittiest men, but who know best \n How to conciliate men's hearts with flattery; \n So that if any one should eat a radish, \n Or stinking shad, they'd take their oaths at once \n That he had eaten lilies, roses, violets; \n And that if any odious smell should rise, \n They'd ask where you did get such lovely scents. \n So that because these men behave so basely, \n That which was used to be accounted honourable, \n Is now accounted base. \n \n \n ","36":"\n And Axionicus, in his Chalcidian, says\u2014] \n When first I wish'd to play the parasite \n With that Philoxenus, while youth did still \n Raise down upon my cheeks, I learnt to bear \n Hard blows from fists, and cups and dishes too, \n \n And bones, so great that oftentimes I was \n All over wounds; but still it paid me well, \n For still the pleasure did exceed the pain. \n And even in some sort I did esteem \n The whole affair desirable for me. \n Is a man quarrelsome, and eager too \n To fight with me? I turn myself to him; \n And all the blame which he does heap upon me, \n I own to be deserved; and am not hurt. \n Does any wicked man call himself good? \n I praise that man, and earn his gratitude. \n To day if I should eat some boiled fish \n I do not mind eating the rest to-morrow. \n Such is my nature and my principle. \n But Antidotus, in his play which is entitled Protochorus, introduces a\n man resembling those who in the Museum of Claudius still practise their\n sophistries; whom it is not even creditable to remember; and he represents him\n speaking thus\u2014 \n Stand each one in your place, and listen to me, \n Before I write my name, and take my cloak. \n If any question should arise to day \n About those men who live as parasites, \n I have at all times much esteem'd their art, \n And from my childhood have inclined to learn it. \n \n \n ","37":"\n And among the parasites these men are commemorated by name: Tithymallus, who is\n mentioned by Alexis in his Milesian Woman, and in his Ulysses the Weaver. And in\n his Olynthians he says\u2014 \n This is your poor man, O my darling woman; \n This is the only class, as men do say, \n Who can put death to flight. Accordingly \n This Tithymallus does immortal live. \n And Dromon in his P???altria says\u2014 \n \n A. I was above all things ashamed when I \n Found that I was again to have a supper \n For which I was to give no contribution. \n \n B. A shameful thing, indeed. Still you may see \n Our Tithymallus on his way, more red \n Than saffron or vermilion; and he blushes, \n As you may guess, because he nothing pays. \n And Timocles, in his Centaur or Dexamenus, says\u2014 \n Calling, him Tithymallus, parasite. \n And in his Caunians he says\u2014 \n \n A. Will any other thing appear? Be quick, \n For Tithymallus has return'd to life, \n \n Who was quite dead, now that he well has boil'd \n Eightpennyworth of lupin seed. \n \n B. For he \n Could not persist in starving himself, but only \n In drinking wine at other men's expense. \n And in his Epistles he says\u2014 \n Alas me, how I am in love! ye gods! \n Not Tithymallus did so long to eat, \n Nor Cormus ever to steal another's cloak, \n Nor Nilus to eat cakes, nor Corydus \n To exercise his teeth at other's cost. \n And Antiphanes says in his Etrurian\u2014 \n \n A. For he will not assist his friends for\n nothing. \n \n B. You say that Tithymallus will be rich, \n For as I understand you, he will get \n Sufficient pay, and a collection suitable \n From those within whose doors he freely sups. \n \n \n ","38":"\n Corydus also was one of the most notorious parasites. And he is mentioned by\n Timocles, in his The Man who Rejoices at Misfortunes of others, thus\u2014 \n To see a well-stock'd market is a treat \n To a rich man, but torture to a poor one. \n Accordingly once Corydus, when he \n Had got no invitation for the day, \n Went to buy something to take home with him. \n And who can cease to laugh at what befel him?\u2014 \n The man had only fourpence in his purse; \n Gazing on tunnies, eels, crabs, rays, anchovies, \n He bit his lips till the blood came in vain; \n Then going round, How much is this? said he\u2014 \n Then frighten'd at the price, he bought red herrings. \n And Alexis, in Demetrius or Philet\u00e6rus, says\u2014 \n I fear to look at Corydus in the face, \n Seeming so glad to dine with any one; \n But I will not deny it; he's the same, \n And never yet refused an invitation. \n And in his Nurse he says\u2014 \n This Corydus who has so often practised \n His jokes and witticisms, wishes now \n To be Blep\u00e6us, and he's not far wrong, \n For mighty are the riches of Blep\u00e6us. \n And Cratinus the younger in his Titans says\u2014 \n Beware of Corydus the wary brassfounder; \n Unless you make your mind up long before \n To leave him nothing. And I warn you now \n \n Never to eat your fish with such a man \n As Corydus; for he's a powerful hand, \n Brazen, unwearied, strong as fire itself. \n But that Corydus used to cut jokes, and was fond of being laughed at for\n them, the same Alexis tells to in his Poets\u2014 \n I have a great desire to raise a laugh, \n And to say witty things, and gain a fame \n Second alone to that of Corydus. \n And Lynceus the Samian repeats several of his sayings, and asserts that\n his proper name was Eucrates. And he writes thus concerning him\u2014 Eucrates,\n who was called Corydus, when he was once feasting with some one whose house was\n in a very shabby condition, said, 'A man who sups here ought to hold up the\n house with his left hand like the Caryatides. \n \n ","39":"\n But Philoxenus, who was surnamed Pternocopis, when it happened to be mentioned\n that thrushes were very dear, and that too while Corydus was present, who was said\n formerly to have prostituted himself\u2014 I, said he, can\n recollect when a lark ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ) only cost an\n obol. (And Philoxenus too was a parasite, as Axionicus has stated in\n his Chalcidian. But the statement is thoroughly proved.) Menander too mentions him\n in his Cecryphalus, calling him Pternocopis only. And Machon the comic writer\n mentions him.\u2014But Machon was either a Corinthian or Sicyonian by birth, living,\n however, in my own city of Alexandria; and he was the tutor of Aristophanes the\n grammarian, as far as comedy went. And he died in Alexandria, and an inscription\n to the following effect is placed upon his tomb\u2014 \n Bring, O light dust, the conqueror's ivy wreath \n To Machon, who shall live beyond the tomb, \n Machon the comic poet; for you hold \n No dirty drone, but you embrace at last \n A worthy relic of antique renown \n These words from the old bard himself might flow, \n City of Cecrops; even by the Nile \n Is found at times a plant to all the Muses dear. \n And surely this is equivalent to a statement that he was an Alexandrian\n by birth. However that may be, Machon mentions Corydus in these terms\u2014 \n A messmate once ask'd Eucrates (Corydus) \n On what terms he and Ptolemy did stand. \n I'm sure, said he, I cannot tell myself: \n For oft he drenches me like any doctor; \n But never gives me solid food to eat. \n \n And Lynceus, in the second book of his treatise on Menander,\n says the men who got a reputation for saying witty things were Euclides the son of\n Smicrinus, and Philoxenus called Pternocopis. And of them Euclides did at times\n say apophthegms not unworthy of being written down and recollected but in all\n other matters he was cold and disagreeable. Bt Philoxenus did not particularly\n excel in short curt sayings, but still whatever he said, whether in the way of\n gossip, or of a bitter attack on any of his companions, or of relation of\n occurrences, was full of pleasant and witty conversation. And yet it happened that\n Euclides was not very popular, but that Philoxenus was loved and respected by\n every one. \n ","40":"\n But Alexis, in his Trophonius, mentions a certain Moschion, a parasite, calling\n him a messmate of every one, and saying\u2014 \n Then comes Moschion, \n Who bears the name of messmate in the world. \n And in his Pancratiast, Alexis, giving a regular catalogue of the dinner\n hunters, says\u2014 \n \n A. First then there was Callimedon the crab; \n Then Cobion, and Corydus, and Cyrebion, \n Scombrus and Semidalis. \n \n B. Hercules! \n This is a list of dishes, not of guests. \n \n But Epicrates was nicknamed Cyrebion, and he was the son-in-law of\n Aeschines the orator, as Demosthenes tells us in the oration about the False\n Embassy. And Anaxandrides, in his Ulysses, mentions such epithets as these, which\n the Athenians used to affix to people out of joke; saying\u2014 \n For ye are always mocking one another; \n I know it well. And if a man be handsome \n You call him Holy Marriage . . . . \n If a man be a perfect dwarf, a mannikin, \n You call him Drop. Is any one a dandy? \n He is called Ololus; you know an instance. \n Does a man walk about all fat and heavy, \n Like Democles? you call him Gravy Soup. \n Does any one love dirt? his name is Dust. \n Does any one bedaub his friends with flattery? \n \n They call him Dingey. Does one want a supper? \n He is the fasting Cestrinus; and if \n One casts one's eye upon a handsome youth, \n They dub one Ceenus, or The Manager. \n Does one in joke convey a lamb away? \n They call one Atreus: or a ram? then Phrixus: \n Or if you take a fleece, they name you Jason. \n \n \n ","41":"\n And he mentions Ch\u00e6rephon the parasite in the passage which precedes this. But\n Menander mentions him likewise in the Cecryphalus: and in his Anger he says\u2014\n \n The man does not differ the least from Ch\u00e6rephon, \n Whoever he may be. He once was ask'd to supper \n At four o'clock, and so he early rose, \n And measuring the shadow on the dial \n By the moon's light, he started off and came \n To eat his supper at the break of day. \n And in his Drunkenness he says\u2014 \n That witty fellow Ch\u00e6rephon delay'd me, \n Saying that he should make a marriage feast \n The twenty-second of the month, that then \n He might dine with his friends the twenty-fourth, \n For that the goddess's affairs were prospering. \n And he mentions him also in his Man-woman, or the Cretan. But Timocles in\n his Letters mentions him especially as having attached himself as a parasite to\n Demotion, who was an intemperate man\u2014 \n But Demotion was one who spared for nothing, \n Thinking his money never could run dry, \n But dinners gave to all who liked to come. \n And Ch\u00e6rephon, that wretchedest of men, \n Treated his house as though it were his own. \n And yet is not this a most shameful thing, \n To take a branded slave for a parasite \n For he's a perfect clown, and not in want. \n And Antiphanes says in his Scythian\u2014 \n Let us go now to sup, just as we are, \n Bearing our torches and our garlands with us; \n 'Twas thus that Ch\u00e6rephon, when supperless, \n Used to man\u0153uvre for an invitation. \n And Timotheus says in his Puppy\u2014 \n Let us start off to go to supper now, \n 'Tis one of twenty covers as he told me; \n Though Ch\u00e6rephon perhaps may add himself. \n \n \n ","42":"\n And Apollodorus the Carystian, in his Priestess, says\u2014 \n They say that Ch\u00e6rephon all uninvited \n Came to the wedding feast of Ophelas, \n \n Thrusting himself in in unheard-of fashion. \n For carrying a basket and a garland \n When it was dark, he said that he had come \n By order of the bride, bringing some birds, \n And on this pretext he did get his supper. \n And in his Murdered Woman he says\u2014 \n I Mars invoke, and mighty Victory, \n To favour this my expedition. \n I also call on Ch\u00e6rephon\u2014but then \n He's sure to come, e'en if I call him not. \n And Machon the comic writer says\u2014 \n Once Ch\u00e6rephon a lengthen'd journey took \n Out of the city to a wedding feast, \n And on his way met Diphilus the poet, \n Who greeted him\u2014\"Take my advice, O Cheerephon, \n And fasten four stout nails to your two cheeks; \n Lest, while you shake your head in your long journey, \n You should put both your jaws quite out of joint. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Ch\u00e6rephon once was purchasing some meat, \n And when the butcher was by chance, he says, \n Cutting him out a joint with too much bone, \n He said, O butcher, don't weigh me that bone. \n Says he, The meat is sweet, indeed men say \n The meat is always sweetest near the bone. \n But Ch\u00e6rephon replied, It may be sweet, \n But still it weighs much heavier than I like. \n And Callimachus attributes to Ch\u00e6rephon a certain treatise, in the list\n which he gives entitled, A Catalogue of all sorts of Things.

No doubt I do; for how should I myself \n Live if misfortune happen'd unto you? \n And Axionicus the comic poet, in his Etrurian, mentions Gryllion the\n parasite in these words\u2014 \n They cannot now make the excuse of wine, \n As Gryllion was always used to do. \n And Aristodemus, in the second book of his Memoranda or Laughable Things,\n gives the following list of parasites\u2014 Sostratus the parasite of Antiochus the\n king, Evagoras the Hunchback, parasite of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and Phormio\n parasite of Seleucus. And Lynceus the Samian, in his Apophthegms, says\u2014\"Silanus\n the Athenian, when Gryllion the parasite of Menander the satrap was passing by in\n a superb robe, and accompanied by a great number of attendants, being asked who he\n was, said, He is a jaw worthy of Menander. But Ch\u00e6rephon the\n parasite, coming once to a wedding feast without being\n invited, and sitting down the last of all, when the gyn\u00e6conomi had counted those\n who were invited, and desired him to depart as having made the number of guests to\n exceed the legitimate number of thirty, said, 'Count us over again, and begin with\n me.' \n ","45":"\n And that it was a custom for the officers called gyn\u00e6conomi to superintend the banquets, and to examine into the\n number of those who had been invited, and see whether it was in accordance with\n the law, we may learn from Timocles in his Litigious Man, where he says\u2014 \n Open the doors at once, that we may be \n More in the light against the gyn\u00e6conomus \n Shall enter and begin to count the guests, \n As he is bound to do by this new law, \n A marvellous statute.

And once when Polyctor the\n harp-player was eating lentil porridge, and had got a stone between his teeth,\n ' O you unhappy man!' said Corydus, 'even a lentil strikes you. ' \n And perhaps he is the same person whom Machon mentions; for\n he says\u2014 \n It seems that once a wretched harp-player, \n Being about to build himself a house, \n Begg'd of a friend to lend him a few stones; \n And many more will I repay, he said, \n When I've display'd my art to all the people. \n And once, when somebody said to Corydus that he sometimes kissed the\n neck, and the breasts, and even the navel ( \u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 ) of his wife, That is very wrong, said he;\n for even Hercules went from Omphale to Hebe. And when\n Phyromachus dipped a piece of bread into some lentil porridge, and upset the dish,\n he said that it was right that he should be fined, because he did not know how to\n eat properly, though he professed to. And once, at Ptolemy's table, when a ragout\n was carried round to the guests, but was finished before it came to him\u2014 O\n Ptolemy, said he, am I drunk, or am I right in thinking that\n these dishes are carried round And when Ch\u00e6rephon the parasite said\n that he was unable to stand much wine, he rejoined, No, nor stand what is\n put into the wine either. And once, when at some entertainment\n Ch\u00e6rephon rose up from supper quite naked\u2014 O Ch\u00e6rephon, said he,\n you are just like a bottle, so that we can see how nearly full you\n are. And when Demosthenes received that goblet from\n Harpalus\u2014 This man, said he, who calls other men hard\n drinkers, has himself swallowed a large cup. And, as he was in the\n habit of bringing dirty loaves to supper, once, when somebody else brought some\n which were blacker still, he said, that he had not brought loaves, but the\n shades of loaves. \n \n ","47":"\n And Philoxenus the parasite, who was surnamed Pternocopis, once was dining with\n Python, and olives ( \u1f10\u03bb\u03ac\u03b1\u03b9 ) were put on the table,\n and after a little while a dish of fish was brought; and he, striking the dish,\n said\u2014 \n \n \u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03be\u03b5\u03bd \u03b4\u02bc \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u1fb7\u03bd. \n \n And once, at supper, when the man who had invited him had set loaves of\n black bread before him, he said, Do not give me too many, lest you should\n darken the room. And Pausimachus said of a certain parasite who was\n maintained by an old woman, That the man who lived with the old woman fared\n in exactly the contrary manner to the old woman her- self;\n for that he was always large. And he is the man of whom Machon writes\n in this manner:\u2013 \n They say that Moschion the water drinker \n Once, when he was with friends in the Lyceum, \n Seeing a parasite who was used to live \n Upon a rich old woman, said to him, \n \"My friend, your fate is truly marvellous; \n For your old dame does give you a big belly.\" \n And the same man, hearing of a parasite who was maintained by an old\n woman, and who lived in habits of daily intimacy with her, said\u2014 \n Nothing is strange henceforth, she brings forth nothing, \n But the man daily doth become big-bellied. \n And Ptolemy, the son of Agesarchus, a native of Megalopolis, in the\n second book of his history of Philopator, says that men to dine with the king were\n collected from every city, and that they were called jesters. \n ","48":"\n And Posidonius of Apamea, in the twenty-third book of his histories, says, \"The\n Celt\u00e6, even when they make war, take about with them companions to dine with them,\n whom they call parasites.

And in his\n thirty-fourth book, the same writer speaks of a man whose name was Apollonius, as\n having been the parasite of Antiochus surnamed Grypus, king of Syria. And\n Aristodemus relates that Bithys, the parasite of king Lysimachus, once, when\n Lysimachus threw a wooden figure of a scorpion on his cloak, leaped up in a great\n fright; but presently, when he perceived the truth, he said, I, too, will\n frighten you, O king!\u2014give me a talent.

And there is no great difference between\n calling a man a flatterer and a parasite. Accordingly, Lynceus the Samian, in his\n Commentaries, gives the name of parasite to Cleisophus, the man who is universally\n described as the flatterer of Philip, the king of the Macedonians (but he was an\n Athenian by birth, as Satyrus the Peripatetic affirms, in his Life of Philip). And\n Lynceus says\u2014 Cleisophus, the parasite of Philip, when Philip rebuked him\n for being continually asking for something, replied, 'I am very forgetful.'\n Afterwards, when Philip had given him a wounded horse, he sold him; and when,\n after a time, the king asked him what had become of him,\n he answered, ' He was sold by that wound of his.' And when Philip laughed at\n him, and took it good-humouredly, he said, 'Is it not then worth my while to\n keep you?' And Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, makes this\n mention of Cleisophus:\u2014 When Philip the king said that writings had been\n brought to him from Cotys, king of Thrace, Cleisophus, who was present, said,\n 'It is well, by the gods.' And when Philip said, But what do you know of the\n subjects mentioned in these writings?' he said, 'By the great Jupiter, you have\n reproved me with admirable judgment.' \n \n ","53":"\n But Satyrus, in his Life of Philip, says, When Philip lost his eye,\n Cleisophus came forth with him, with bandages on the same eye as the king; and\n again, when his leg was hurt, he came out limping, along with the king. And if\n ever Philip ate any harsh or sour food, he would contract his features, as if\n he, too, had the same taste in his mouth. But in the country of the Arabs they\n used to do these things, not out of flattery, but in obedience to some law; so\n that whenever the king had anything the matter with any one of his limbs, the\n courtiers pretended to be suffering the same inconvenience: for they think it\n ridiculous to be willing to be buried with him when he dies, but not to pay him\n the compliment of appearing to be subject to the same sufferings as he is while\n alive, if he sustains any injury. But Nicolaus of Damascus,\u2014and he was\n one of the Peripatetic school,\u2014in his very voluminous history (for it consisted of\n a hundred and forty-four books), in the hundred and eleventh book says, that\n Adiatomus the king of the Sotiani (and that is a Celtic tribe) had six hundred\n picked men about him, who were called by the Gauls, in their national language,\n Siloduri\u2014which word means in Greek, Bound under a vow. And the king has\n them as companions, to live with him and to die with him; as that is the vow\n which they all take. In return for which, they also share his power, and wear\n the same dress, and eat the same food; and they die when he dies, as a matter\n of absolute necessity, if the king dies of any disease; or if he dies in war,\n or in any other manner. And no one can even say that any of them has shown any\n fear of death, or has in the least sought to evade it when the king is\n dead. \n \n ","54":"\n But Theopompus says, in the forty-fourth book of his \n Histories, that Philip appointed Thrasyd\u00e6us the Thessalian tyrant over all those\n of his nation, though a man who had but little intellect, but who was an egregious\n flatterer. But Arcadion the Ach\u00e6an was not a flatterer, who is mentioned by the\n same Theopompus, and also by Duris in the fifth book of his History of Macedonian\n Affairs. Now this Arcadion hated Philip, and on account of this hatred voluntarily\n banished himself from his country. And he was a man of the most admirable natural\n abilities, and numbers of clever sayings of his are related. It happened then\n once, when Philip was sojourning at Delphi, that Arcadion also was there; and the\n Macedonian beheld him and called him to him, and said, How much further, O\n Arcadion, do you mean to go by way of banishment? And he replied\u2014 \n Until I meet with men who know not Philip. \n But Phylarchus, in the twenty-first book of his History, says that Philip\n laughed at this, and invited Arcadion to supper, and that in that way he got rid\n of his enmity. But of Nicesias the flatterer of Alexander, Hegesander gives the\n following account:\u2014 When Alexander complained of being bitten by the flies\n and was eagerly brushing them off, a man of the name of Nicesias, one of his\n flatterers who happened to be present, said, \u2014Beyond all doubt those flies will\n be far superior to all other flies, now that they have tasted your\n blood. And the same man says that Cheirisophus also, the flatterer of\n Dionysius, when he saw Dionysius laughing with some of his acquaintances, (but he\n was some way off himself, so that he could not hear what they were laughing at,)\n laughed also. And when Dionysius asked him on what account he, who could not\n possibly hear what was said, laughed, said\u2014I feel that confidence in you that I am\n quite sure that what has been said is worth laughing at. \n ","55":"\n His son also, the second Dionysius, had numerous flatterers, who were called by\n the common people Dionysiocolaces. And they, because Dionysius himself was not\n very sharp sighted, used to pretend while at supper not to be able to see very\n far, but they would touch whatever was near them as if they could not see it,\n until Dionysius himself guided their hands to the dishes. And when Dionysius spat,\n they would often put out their own faces for him to spit upon: and then licking off the spittle and even his vomit, they declared that\n it was sweeter than honey. And Tim\u00e6us, in their twenty-second book of his\n Histories, says that Democles the flatterer of the younger Dionysius, as it was\n customary in Sicily to make a sacrifice from house to house in honour of the\n nymphs, and for men to spend the night around their statues when quite drunk, and\n to dance around the goddesses\u2014Democles neglecting the nymphs, and saying that\n there was no use in attending to lifeless deities, went and danced before\n Dionysius. And at a subsequent time being once sent on an embassy with some\n colleagues to Dion, when they were all proceeding in a trireme, he being accused\n by the rest of behaving in a seditious manner in respect of this journey, and of\n having injured the general interests of Dionysius, when Dionysius was very\n indignant, he said that differences had arisen between himself and his colleagues,\n because after supper they took a p\u00e6an of Phrynichus or Stesichorus, and some of\n them took one of Pindar's and sang it; but he, with those who agreed with him,\n went entirely through the hymns which had been composed by Dionysius himself. And\n he undertook to bring forward undeniable proof of this assertion. For that his\n accusers were not acquainted with the modulation of those songs, but that he on\n the contrary was ready to sing them all through one after the other. And so, when\n Dionysius was pacified, Democles continued, and said, But you would do me a\n great favour, O Dionysius, if you were to order any one of those who knows it\n to teach me the paean which you composed in honour of Aesculapius; for I hear\n that you have taken great pains with that. \n \n And once, when some friends were invited to supper by Dionysius, Dionysius coming\n into the room, said, O, my friends, letters have been sent to us from the\n generals who have been despatched to Naples; and Democles interrpting\n him, said, By the gods, they have done well, O Dionysius. And he,\n looking upon him, said, But how do you know whether what they have written\n is in accordance with my expectation or the contrary? And Democles\n replied, By the gods, you have properly rebuked me, O Dionysius. \n Tim\u00e6us also affirms that there was a man named Satyrus, who was a flatterer of\n both the Dionysii. \n ","56":"\n And Hegesander relates that Hiero the tyrant was also rather\n weak in his eyes; and that his friends who supped with him made mistakes in the\n dishes on purpose, in order to let him set them right, and to give him an\n opportunity of appearing clearer-sighted than the rest. And Hegesander says that\n Euclides, who was surnamed Seutlus, (and he too was a parasite,) once when a great\n quantity of sow-thistles ( \u03c3\u03cc\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ) was set before\n him at a banquet, said, \"Capaneus, who is introduced by Euripides in his Suppliant\n Women, was a very witty man\u2014 \n Detesting tables where there was too much pride ( \u1f44\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n But those who were the leaders of the people at Athens, says he, in the\n Chrernonidean war, flattered the Athenians, and said, that everything else\n was common to all the Greeks; but that the Athenians were the only men who knew\n the road which leads to heaven. And Satyrus, in his Lives, says that\n Anaxarchus, the Eud\u00e6monical philosopher, was one of the flatterers of Alexander;\n and that he once, when on a journey in company with the king, when a violent and\n terrible thunderstorm took place, so as to frighten everybody, said\u2014 Was it\n you, O Alexander, son of Jupiter, who caused this? And that he laughed\n and said\u2014 Not I; for I do not wish to be formidable, as you make me out; you\n also desire me to have brought to me at supper the heads of satraps and\n kings. And Aristobulus of Cassandria says that Dioxippus the Athenian,\n a pancratiast, once when Alexander was wounded and when the blood flowed, said\u2014\n \n 'Tis ichor, such as flows from the blessed gods. \n \n \n ","57":"\n And Epicrates the Athenian, having gone on an embassy to the king, according to\n the statement of Hegesander, and having received many presents from him, was not\n ashamed to flatter the king openly and boldly, so as even to say that the best way\n was not to choose nine archons every year, but nine ambassadors to the king. But I\n wonder at the Athenians, how they allowed him to make such a speech without\n bringing him to trial, and yet fined Demades ten talents, because he thought\n Alexander a god; and they put Evagoras to death, because when he went as\n ambassador to the king he adored him. And Timon the Phliasian, in the third book\n of his Silli, says that Ariston the Chian, an acquaintance and pupil of Zeno the\n Citiean, was a flatterer of Pers\u00e6us the philosopher, because\n he was a companion of Antigonus the king. But Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his\n Histories, says that Nicesias the flatterer of Alexender, when he saw the king in\n convulsions from some medicine which he had taken, said\u2014 O king, what must\n we do when even you gods suffer in this manner? and that Alexender,\n scarcely looking up, said\u2014 What sort of gods? I a afraid rather we are hated\n by the gods. And in his twenty eighth book the same Phylarchus says\n that Apollophanes was a flatterer of Antigonus who was surnamed Epitropu, who took\n Laced\u00e6mon, and who used to say that the forte of Antigonus Alexandrized. \n ","58":"\n But Euphantus, in the fourth book of his Histories, says that Callicrates was a\n flatterer of Ptolemy, the third king of Egypt, who was so subtle a flatterer that\n he not only bore an image of Ulysses on his seal, but that he also gave his\n children the names of Telegonus and Anticlea. And Polybius, in the thirteenth book\n of his Histories says that Heraclides the Tarentine was a flatterer of the Philip\n whose power was destroyed by the Romans; and that, it was he who overturned his\n whole kingdom. And in his fourteenth book, he says that Philo was a flatterer of\n Agathocles the son of \u0152nanthe, and the companion of the king Ptolemy Philopator.\n And Baton of Sinope relates, in his book bout the tyranny of Hieronymus, that\n Thraso, who was surnamed Carcharus, was the flatterer of Hieronymus the tyrant of\n Syracuse, saying that he every day used to drink a great quantity of unmixed wine.\n But another flatterer, by name Osis, caused Thraso to be put to death by\n Hieronymus; ad he persuaded Hieronymus himself to assume the diadem, and the\n purple and all the rest of the royal apparel, which Dionysius the tyrant was\n accustomed to wear. And Agatharchides, in the thirtieth book of his Histories,\n says\u2014\"H\u00e6resippus the Spartanwas a man of no moderate iniquity, not even putting on\n any appearance of goodness; but having very persuasive flattering language, and\n being a very clever man at paying court to the rich as long as their fortune\n lasted. Such also was Heraclides the Maronite, the flatterer of Seuthes the king\n of the Thracians, who is mentioned by Xenophon in the seventh book of the\n Anabasis. \n ","59":"\n But Theopompus, in the eighteenth book of his Histories, speaking of Nicostratus\n the Argive, and saying how he flattered the Persian king,\n writes as follows\u2014\"But how can we think Nicostratus the Argive anything but a\n wicked man? who, when he was president of the city of Argos, and when he had\n received all the distinctions of family, and riches, and large estates from his\n ancestors, surpassed all men in his flatteries and attentions to the king,\n outrunning not only those who bore a part in that expedition, but even all who had\n lived before; for in the first place, he was so anxious for honours from the\n barbarian, that, wishing to please him more and to be more trusted by him, he\n brought his son to the king, a thing which no one else will ever be found to have\n done. And then, every day when he was about to go to supper he had a table set\n apart, to which he gave the name of the Table of the King's Deity, loading it with\n meat and all other requisites; hearing that those who live at the doors of the\n royal palace among the Persians do the same thing, and thinking that by this\n courtier-like attention he should get more from the king. For he was exceedingly\n covetous, and not scrupulous as to the means he employed forgetting money, so that\n indeed no one was ever less so. And Lysimachus was a flatterer and the tutor of\n Attalus the king, a man whom Callimachus sets down as a Theodorean, but Hermippus\n sets him down in the list of the disciples of Theophrastus. And this man wrote\n books also about the education of Attalus, full of every kind of adulation\n imaginable. But Polybius, in the eighth book of his Histories, says,\n Cavarus the Gaul, who was in other respects a good man, was depraved by\n Sostratus the flatterer, who was a Chalcedonian by birth. \n \n ","60":"\n Nicolaus, in the hundred and fourteenth book of his Histories, says that\n Andromachus of Carrh\u00e6 was a flatterer of Licinius Crassus, who commanded the\n expedition against the Parthians; and that Crassus communicated all his designs to\n him, and was, in consequence, betrayed to the Parthians by him, and so destroyed.\n But Andromachus was not allowed by the deity to escape unpunished. For having\n obtained, as the reward of his conduct, the sovereignty over his native place\n Carrh\u00e6, he behaved with such cruelty and violence that he was burnt with his whole\n family by the Carrhans. And Posidonius the Apamean, who was afterwards surnamed\n Rhodius, in the fourth book of his Histories, says that Hierax of Antioch, who\n used formerly to accompany the singers called Lysiodi on the\n flute, afterwards became a terrible flatterer of Ptolemy, seventh king of Egypt of\n that name, who was also surnamed Euergetes; and that h had the very greatest\n influence over him, as also he had with Ptolemy Philometor, though he was\n afterwards put to death by him. And Nicolaus the Peripatetic states that Sosipater\n was a flatterer of Mithridates, a man who was by trade a conjurer. And Theopompus,\n in the ninth book of his History of Grecian Affairs, says that Athen\u00e6us the\n Eretrian was a flatterer and servant of Sisyphus the tyrant of Pharsalus. \n ","61":"\n The whole populace of the Athenians, too, was very notorious for the height to\n which it pushed its flattery; accordingly, Demochares the cousin of Demosthenes\n the orator, in the twentieth book of his Histories, speaking of the flattery\n practised by the Athenians towards Demetrius Poliorcetes, and saying that he\n himself did not at all like it, writes as follows\u2014 And some of these things\n annoyed him greatly, as they well might. And, indeed, other parts of their\n conduct were utterly mean and disgraceful. They consecrated temples to Le\u00e6na\n Venus and Lamia Venus, and they erected altars and shrines as if to heroes, and\n instituted libations in honour of Burichus, and Adeimantus, and Oxythemis, his\n flatterers. And poems were sung in honour of all these people, so that even\n Demetrius himself was astonished at what they did, and said that in his time\n there was not one Athenian of a great or vigorous mind. The Thebans\n also flattered Demetrius, as Polemo relates in the treatise on the Ornamented\n Portico at Sicyon; and they, too, erected a temple to Lamia Venus. But she was one\n of Demetrius's mistresses, as also was Le\u00e6na. So that why should we wonder at the\n Athenians, who stooped even to become flatterers of flatterers, singing p\u00e6ans and\n hymns to Demetrius himself? \n Accordingly Demochares, in the twenty-first book of his Histories, says\u2014 And\n the Athenians received Demetrius when he came from Leucadia and Corcyra to\n Athens, not only with frankincense, and crowns, and libations of wine, but they\n even went out to meet him with hymns, and choruses, and ithyphalli, and dancing\n and singing, and they stood in front of him in multitudes, dancing and singing,\n and saying that he was the only true god, and that all the rest of the gods\n were either asleep, or gone away to a distance, or were no god at all. And they called him the son of Neptune and Venus, for\n he was eminent for beauty, and affable to all men with a natural courtesy and\n gentleness of manner. And they fell at his feet and addressed supplications and\n prayers to him. \n \n ","62":"\n Demochares, then, has said all this about the adulatory spirit and conduct of the\n Athenians. And Duris the Samian, in the twenty-second book of his Histories, has\n given the very ithyphallic hymn which they addressed to him\u2014 \n Behold the greatest of the gods and dearest \n Are come to this city, \n For here Demeter and Demetrius are \n Present in season. \n She indeed comes to duly celebrate \n The sacred mysteries \n Of her most holy daughter\u2014he is present \n Joyful and beautiful, \n As a god ought to be, with smiling face \n Showering his blessings round. \n How noble doth he look! his friends around, \n Himself the centre. \n His friends resemble the bright lesser stars, \n Himself is Ph\u0153bus. \n Hail, ever-mighty Neptune's mightier son; \n Hail, son of Venus. \n For other gods do at a distance keep, \n Or have no ears, \n Or no existence; and they heed not us\u2014 \n But you are present, \n Not made of wood or stone, a genuine god. \n We pray to thee. \n First of all give us peace, O dearest god\u2014 \n For you are lord of peace\u2014 \n And crush for us yourself, for you've the power, \n 'This odious Sphinx; \n Which now destroys not Thebes alone, but Greece\u2014 \n The whole of Greece\u2014 \n I mean th' Aetolian, who, like her of old, \n Sits on a rock, \n And tears and crushes all our wretched bodies. \n Nor can we him resist. \n For all th' Aetolians plunder all their neighbours; \n And now they stretch afar \n Their lion hands; but crush them, mighty lord, \n Or send some \u0152dipus \n Who shall this Sphinx hurl down from off his precipice, \n Or starve him justly. \n \n \n \n ","63":"\n This is what was sung by the nation which once fought at Marathon, and they sang\n it not only in public, but in their private houses-men who had once put a man to\n death for offering adoration to the king of Persia, ad who had slain countless\n myriads of barbarians. Therefore, Alexis, in his Apothecary or Cratevas,\n introduces a person pledging one of the guests in a cup of wine, and represents\n him as saying\u2014 \n Boy, give a larger cup, and pour therein \n Four cyathi of strong and friendly drink, \n In honour of all present. Then you shall add \n Three more for love; one for the victory, \n The glorious victory of King Antigonus, \n Another for the young Demetrius. \n * * * * And presently he adds\u2014 \n Bring a third cup in honour now of Venus, \n The lovely Venus. Hail, my friends and guests; \n I drink this cup to the success of all of you. \n \n \n ","64":"\n Such were the Athenians at that time, after flattery, that worst of wild beasts,\n had inspired their city with frenzy, that city which once the Pythia entitled the\n Hearth of Greece, and which Theopompus, who hated them, called the Prytaneum of\n Greece; he who said in other places that Athens was full of drunken flatterers,\n and sailors, and pickpockets, and also of false witnesses, sycophants, and false\n accusers. And it is my opinion that it was they who introduced all the flattery\n which we have been speaking of, like a storm, or other infliction, sent on men by\n the gods; concerning which Diogenes said, very elegantly\u2014 That it was much\n better to go \u1f10\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 than \u1f10\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2, who eat up all the good men while they\n are still alive; and, accordingly, Anaxilas says, in his Young Woman\u2014\n \n The flatterers are worms which prey upon \n All who have money; for they make an entrance \n Into the heart of a good guileless man, \n And take their seat there, and devour it, \n Till they have drain'd it like the husk of wheat, \n And leave the shell; and then attack some other. \n And Plato says, in his Ph\u00e6drus\u2014 Nature has mingled some pleasure\n which is not entirely inelegant in its character of a flatterer, though he is\n an odious beast, and a great injury to a state. And Theophrastus, in\n his treatise on Flattery, says that Myrtis the priest, the\n Argive, taking by the ear Cleonymus (who was a dancer and also a flatterer, and\n who often used to come and sit by him and his fellow-judges, and who was anxious\n to be seen in company with those who were thought of consideration in the city),\n and dragging him out of-the assembly, said to him in the hearing of many people,\n You shall not dance here, and you shall not hear us. And Diphilus, in his\n Marriage, says\u2014 \n A flatterer destroys \n By his pernicious speeches \n Both general and prince, \n Both private friends and states; \n He pleases for a while, \n But causes lasting ruin. \n And now this evil habit \n Has spread among the people, \n Our courts are all diseased, \n And all is done by favour. \n So that the Thessalians did well who razed the city which was called\n Colaceia (Flattery), which the Melians used to inhabit, as Theopompus relates in\n the thirtieth book of his History. \n ","65":"\n But Phylarchus says, that those Athenians who settled in Lemnos were great\n flatterers, mentioning them as such in the thirteenth book of his History. For\n that they, wishing to display their gratitude to the descendants of Seleucus and\n Antiochus, because Seleucus not only delivered them when they were severely\n oppressed by Lysimachus, but also restored both their cities to them,\u2014they, I say,\n the Athenians in Lemnos, not only erected temples to Seleucus, but also to his son\n Antiochus; and they have given to the cup, which at their feasts is offered at the\n end of the banquet, the name of the cup of Seleucus the Saviour. \n Now some people, perverting the proper name, call this flattery \u1f00\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, complaisance; as Anaxandrides does in his\n Samian, where he says\u2014 \n For flattery is now complaisance call'd. \n But those who devote themselves to flattery are not aware that that art\n is one which flourishes only a short time. Accordingly, Alexis says in his Liar\u2014\n \n A flatterer's life but a brief space endures, \n For no one likes a hoary parasite. \n \n And Clearchus the Solensian, in the first book of his Amatory\n treatises, says\u2014 No flatterer is constant in his friendship. For time\n destroys the falsehood of his pretences, and a lover is only a flatterer and a\n pretended friend on account of youth or beauty. One of the flatterers\n of Demetrius the king was Adeimantus of Lampsacus, who having built a temple in\n Thri\u00e6, and placed statues in it, called it the temple of Phila Venus, and called\n the place itself Phil\u00e6um, from Phila the mother of Demetrius; as we are told by\n Dionysius the son of Tryphon, in the tenth book of his treatise on Names. \n ","66":"\n But Clearchus the Solensian, in his book which is inscribed Gergithius, tells us\n whence the origin of the name flatterer is derived; and mentioning Gergithius\n himself, from whom the treatise has its name, he says that he was one of\n Alexander's flatterers; and he tells the story thus\u2014 That flattery debases\n the characters of the flatterers, making them apt to despise whoever they\n associate with; and a proof of this is, that they endure everything, well\n knowing what they dare do. And those who are flattered by them, being puffed up\n by their adulation, they make foolish and empty-headed, and cause them to\n believe that they, and everything belonging to them, are of a higher order than\n other people. And ten proceeding to mention a certain young man, a\n Paphian by birth, but a king by the caprice of fortune, he says\u2014\"This young man\n (and he does not mention his name) used out of his preposterous luxury to lie on a\n couch with silver feet, with a smooth Sardian carpet spread under it of the most\n expensive description. And over him was thrown a piece of purple cloth, edged with\n a scarlet fringe; and he had three pillows under his head made of the finest\n linen, and of purple colour, by which he kept himself cool. And under his feet he\n had two pillows of the kind called Dorian, of a bright crimson colour; and on all\n this he lay himself, clad in a white robe. \n ","67":"\n \"And all the monarchs who have at any time reigned in Cyprus have encouraged a\n race of nobly-born flatterers as useful to them; for they are a possession very\n appropriate to tyrants. And no one ever knows them (any more the they do the\n judges of the Areopagus), either how many they are, or who they are, except that\n perhaps some of the most eminent may be known or suspected.\n And the flatterers at Salamis are divided into two classes with reference to their\n families; and it is from the flatterers in Salamis that all the rest of the\n flatterers in the other parts of Cyprus are derived; and one of these two classes\n is called the Gergini, and the other the Promalanges. Of which, the Gergini mingle\n with the people in the city, and go about as eavesdroppers and spies in the\n workshops and the market-places; and whatever they hear, they report every day to\n those who are called their Principals. But the Promalanges, being a sort of\n superior investigators, inquire more particularly into all that is reported by the\n Gergini which appears worthy of being investigated; and the way in which they\n conduct themselves to- wards every one is so artificial and gentle, that, as it\n seems to me, and as they themselves allege, the very seed of notable flatterers\n has been spread by them over all the places at a distance. Nor do they pride\n themselves slightly on their skill, because they are greatly honoured by the\n kings; but they say that one of the Gergini, being a descendant of those Trojans\n whom Teucer took as slaves, having selected them from the captives, and then\n brought and settled in Cyprus, going along-the sea-coast with a few companions,\n sailed towards Aeolis, in order to seek out and re-establish the country of his\n ancestors; and that he, taking some Mysians to himself, inhabited a city near the\n Trojan Ida, which was formerly called Gergina, from the name of the inhabitants,\n but is now called Gergitha. For some of the party being, as it seems, separated\n from this expedition, stopped in Cym\u00e6a, being by birth a Cretan race, and not from\n the Thessalian Tricca, as some have affirmed,\u2014men whose ignorance I take to be\n beyond the skill of all the descendants of Aesculapius to cure. \n ","68":"\n \n There were also in this country, in the time of Glutus the Carian, women\n attaching themselves to the Queens, who were called flatterers; and a few of\n them who were left crossed the sea, and were sent for to the wives of Artabazus\n and Mentor, and instead of \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 were\n called \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 from this circumstance. By\n way of making themselves agreeable to those who had sent for them, they made a\n ladder ( \u03ba\u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ) of themselves, in such a\n manner that there was a way of ascending over their backs, and also a way of\n descending, for their mistresses when they drove out in chariots: to such a pitch of luxury, not to say of miserable helplessness, did\n they bring those silly women by their contrivance therefore, they themselves,\n when they were compelled by fortune to quit that very luxurious way of living,\n lived with great hardship in their old age. And the others who had received\n these habits from us, when they were deprived of their authority came to\n Macedonia; and the customs which they taught to the wives and princesses of the\n great men in that country by their association with them, it is not decent even\n to mention farther than this, that practising magic arts themselves, and being\n the objects of them when practised by others, they did not spare even the\n places of the greatest resort, but they became complete vagabonds, and the very\n scum of the streets, polluted with all sorts of abominations. Such and so great\n are the evils which seem to be engendered by flattery in the case of all people\n who admit from their own inclination and predisposition to be\n flattered. \n \n ","69":"\n And a little further Clearchus goes on as follows:\u2014 \"But still a man may have a\n right to find fault with that young man for the way in which he used those things,\n as I have said before. For his slaves stood in short tunics a little behind the\n couch: and as there are now three men on whose account all this discussion has\n been originated, and as all these men are men who have separate names among us,\n the one sat on the couch close to his feet, letting the feet of the young man rest\n upon his knees, and covering them with a thin cloth; and what he did further is\n plain enough, even if I do not mention it. And this servant is called by the\n natives Parabystus, because he works his way into the company of those men even\n who do not willingly receive him, by the very skilful character of his flatteries.\n The second was one sitting on a certain chair which was placed close to the couch;\n and he, holding by the hand of the young mar, as he let it almost drop, and\n clinging to it, kept on rubbing it, and taking each of his fingers in turn he\n rubbed it and stretched it, so that the man appeared to have said a very with\n thing who first gave that officer the name of Sicya. The third, however,\n was the most noble of all, and was called Theer (or the wild beast), who was\n indeed the principal person of the whole body, and who stood at his master's head,\n and shared his linen pillows, lying upon them in a most\n friendly manner, And with his left hand he kept smoothing the hair of the young\n man, and with his right hand he kept moving up and down a Phoc\u00e6an fan, so as to\n please him while waving it, without force enough to brush anything away. On which\n account, it appears to me, that some high-born god must have been angry with him\n and have sent a fly to attack the young man, a fly like that with whose audacity\n Homer says that Minerva inspired Menelaus, so vigorous and fearless was it in\n disposition. \n \n So when the young man was stung, this man uttered such a loud scream in his\n behalf, and was so indignant, that on account of his hatred to one fly he\n banished the whole tribe of flies from his house: from which it is quite plain\n that he appointed this servant for this especial purpose. \n \n ","70":"\n But Leucon, the tyrant of Pontus, was a different kind of man, who when he knew\n that many of his friends had been plundered by one of the flatterers whom he had\n about him, perceiving that the man was calumniating some one of his remaining\n friends, said, I swear by the gods that I would kill you if a tyrannical\n government did not stand in need of bad men. And Antiphanes the comic\n writer, in his Soldier, gives a similar account of the luxury of the kings in\n Cyprus. And he represents one of them as asking a soldier these questions\u2014 \n \n A. Tell me now, you had lived some time in\n Cyprus \n Say you not so? \n \n B. Yes, all the time of the war. \n \n A. In what part most especially? tell me that. \n \n B. In Paphos, where you should have seen the\n luxury \n That did exist, or you could not believe it. \n \n A. What kind of luxury? \n \n B. The king was fann'd \n While at his supper by young turtle-doves \n And by nought else. \n \n A. How mean you? never mind \n My own affairs, but let me ask you this. \n B. He was anointed with a luscious ointment \n Brought up from Syria, made of some rich fruit \n Which they do say doves love to feed upon. \n They were attracted by the scent and flew \n Around the royal temples; and had dared \n To seat themselves upon the monarch's head, \n But that the boys who sat around with sticks \n Did keep them at a slight and easy distance. \n \n And so they did not perch, but hover'd round, \n Neither too far nor yet too near, still fluttering, \n So that they raised a gentle breeze to blow \n Not harshly on the forehead of the king. \n \n \n ","71":"\n The flatterer ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03be ) of that young man whom we\n have been speaking of must have been a \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03be, (a soft flatterer,) as Clearchus says. For besides\n flattering such a man as that, he invents a regular gait and dress harmonizing\n with that of those who receive the flattery, folding his arms and wrapping himself\n up in a small cloak; on which account some men call him Paranconistes, and some\n call him a Repository of Attitudes. For really a flatterer does seem to be the\n very same person with Proteus himself. Accordingly he changes into nearly every\n sort of person, not only in form, but also in his discourse, so very varied in\n voice he is. \n But Androcydes the physician said that flattery had its name ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ) from becoming glued ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\n \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) to men's acquaintance. But it appears to me that\n they were named from their facility; because a flatterer will undergo anything,\n like a person who stoops down to carry another on his back, by reason of his\n natural disposition, not being annoyed at anything, however disgraceful it may\n be. \n And a man will not be much out who calls the life of that young Cyprian a wet one.\n And Alexis says that there were many tutors and teachers of that kind of life at\n Athens, speaking thus in his Pyraunus\u2014 \n I wish'd to try another style of life, \n Which all men are accustom'd to call wet. \n So walking three days in the Ceramicus, \n I found it may be thirty skilful teachers \n Of the aforesaid life, from one single school. \n And Crobylus says in his Female Deserter\u2014 \n The wetness of your life amazes me, \n For men do call intemperance now wetness. \n \n \n ","72":"\n And Antiphanes, in his Lemnian Women, lays it down that flattery is a kind of art,\n where he says\u2014 \n Is there, or can there be an art more pleasing, \n Or any source of gain more sure and gainful \n Than well-judged flattery? Why does the painter \n Take so much pains and get so out of temper? \n Why does the farmer undergo such risks? \n Indeed all men are full of care and trouble. \n But life for us is full of fun and laughter. \n \n For where the greatest business is amusement, \n To laugh and joke and drink full cups of wine, \n Is not that pleasant't How can one deny? \n 'Tis the next thing to being rich oneself. \n \n \n But Menander, in his play called the Flatterer, has given us the character of one\n as carefully and faithfully as it was possible to manage it: as also Diphilus has\n of a parasite in his Telesias. And Alexis, in his Liar, has introduced a flatterer\n speaking in the following manner\u2014 \n By the Olympian Jove and by Minerva \n I am a happy man. And not alone \n Because I'm going to a wedding dinner, \n But because I shall burst, an it please God. \n And would that I might meet with such a death. \n And it seems to me, my friends, that that fine epicure would not have\n scrupled to quote from the Omphale of Ion the tragedian, and to say\u2014 \n For I must speak of a yearly feast \n As if it came round every day. \n \n \n ","73":"\n But Hippias the Erythr\u00e6an, in the second book of his Histories of his own Country,\n relating how the kingdom of Cnopus was subverted by the conduct of his flatterers,\n says this\u2014\"When Cnopus consulted the oracle about his safety, the god, in his\n answer, enjoined him to sacrifice to the crafty Mercury. And when, after that, he\n went to Delphi, they who were anxious to put an end to his kingly power in order\n to establish an oligarchy instead of it, (and those who wished this were Ortyges,\n and Irus, and Echarus, who, because they were most conspicuous in paying court to\n the princes, were called adorers and flatterers,) they, I say, being on a voyage\n in company with Cnopus, when they were at a distance from land, bound Cnopus and\n threw him into the sea; and then they sailed to Chios, and getting a force from\n the tyrants there, Amphiclus and Polytechnus, they sailed by night to Erythr\u00e6, and\n just at the same time the corpse of Cnopus was washed up on the sea-shore at\n Erythr\u00e6, at a place which is now called Leopodon. And while Cleonice, the wife of\n Cnopus, was busied about the offices due to the corpse, (and it was the time of\n the festival and assembly instituted in honour of Diana Stophea,) on a sudden\n there is heard the noise of a trumpet; and the city is taken by Ortyges and his\n troops, and many of the friends of Cnopus are put to death; and Cleonice, hearing\n what had happened, fled to Colophon. \n \n ","74":"\n \n But Ortyges and his companions, establishing themselves as tyrants, and\n having possessed themselves of the supreme power in Chios, destroyed all who\n opposed their proceedings, and they subverted the laws, and themselves managed\n the whole of the affairs of the state, admitting none of the popular party\n within the walls. And they established a court of justice outside the walls,\n before the gates; and there they tried all actions, sitting as judges, clothed\n in purple cloaks, and in tunics with purple borders, and they wore sandals with\n many slits in them during the hot weather; but in winter they always walked\n about in women's shoes; and they let their hair grow, and took great care of it\n so as to have ringlets, dividing it on the top of their head with fillets of\n yellow and purple. And they wore ornaments of solid gold, like women, and they\n compelled some of the citizens to carry their litters, and some to act as\n lictors to them, and some to sweep the roads. And they sent for the sons of\n some of the citizens to their parties when they supped together; and some they\n ordered to bring their own wives and daughters within. And on those who\n disobeyed they inflicted the most extreme punishment. And if any one of their\n companions died, then collecting the citizens with their wives and children,\n they compelled them by violence to utter lamentations over the dead, and to\n beat their breasts, and to cry out shrilly and loudly with their voices, a man\n with a scourge standing over them, who compelled them to do so\u2014until Hippotes,\n the brother of Cnopus, coming to Erythr\u00e6 with an army at the time of a\n festival, the people of Erythr\u00e6 assisting him, set upon the tyrants, and having\n punished a great many of their companions, slew Ortyges in his flight, and all\n who were with him, and treated their wives and children with the very extremity\n of ill-usage, and delivered his country. \n \n ","75":"\n Now from all this we may understand, my friends, of how many evils flattery is the\n cause in human life. For Theopompus, in the nineteenth book of his history of the\n Transactions of Philip, says, Agathocles was a slave, and one of the\n Penestee in Thessaly, and as he had great influence with Philip by reason of\n his flattery of him, and because he was constantly at his entertainments\n dancing and making him laugh, Philip sent him to destroy the Perrh\u00e6bi, and to\n govern all that part of the country. And the Macedonian constantly had this kind of people about him, with whom he associated\n the greater part of his time, because of their fondness for drinking and\n buffoonery, and in their company he used to deliberate on the most important\n affairs. And Hegesander the Delphian gives a similar account of him,\n and relates how he sent a large sum of money to the men who are assembled at\n Athens at the temple of Hercules in Diomea, and who say laughable things; and he\n ordered some men to write down all that was said by them, and to send it to him.\n And Theopompus, in the twenty-sixth book of his History, says that Philip\n knowing that the Thessalians were an intemperate race, and very profligate in\n their way of living, prepared some entertainments for them, and endeavoured in\n every possible manner to make himself agreeable to them. For he danced and\n revelled, and practised every kind of intemperance and debauchery. And he was\n by nature a buffoon, and got drunk every day, and he delighted in those\n occupations which are consistent with such practices, and with those who are\n called witty men, who say and do things to provoke laughter. And he attached\n numbers of the Thessalians who were intimate with him to himself, still more by\n his entertainments than by his presents. And Dionysius the Sicilian\n used to do very nearly the same thing, as Eubulus the comic poet tells us in his\n play entitled Dionysius;\u2014 \n But he is harsh and rigorous to the solemn, \n But most good-humour'd to all flatterers, \n And all who jest with freedom. For he thinks \n Those men alone are free, though slaves they be. \n \n \n ","76":"\n And indeed Dionysius was not the only person who encouraged and received those who\n had squandered their estates on drunkenness and gambling and all such debauchery\n as that, for Philip also did the same. And Theopompus speaks of such of them in\n the forty-ninth book of his History, where he writes as follows:\u2014 Philip\n kept at a distance all men who were well regulated in their conduct and who\n took care of their property; but the extravagant and those who lived in\n gambling and drunkenness he praised and honoured. And therefore he not only\n took care that they should always have such amusements, but he encouraged them\n to devote themselves to all sorts of injustice and debauchery besides. For what\n disgraceful or iniquitous practices were there to which \n these men were strangers, or what virtuous or respectable habits were there\n which they did not shun? Did they not at all times go about shaven and\n carefully made smooth, though they were men? And did not they endeavour to\n misuse one another though they had beards? And they used to go about attended\n by two or three lovers at a time; and they expected no complaisance from others\n which they were not prepared to exhibit themselves. On which account a man\n might very reasonably have thought them not \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 but \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9, and one\n might have called them not soldiers, but prostitutes. For though they were\n \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 by profession, they were \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 by practice. And in addition to all this,\n instead of loving sobriety, they loved drunkenness; and instead of living\n respectably they sought every opportunity of robbing and murdering; and as for\n speaking the truth, and adhering to their agreements, they thought that conduct\n quite inconsistent with their characters; but to perjure themselves and cheat,\n they thought the most venerable behaviour possible. And they disregarded what\n they had, but they longed for what they had not; and this too, though a great\n part of Europe belonged to them. For I think that the companions of Philip, who\n did not at that time amount to a greater number than eight hundred, had\n possession so far as to enjoy the fruits of more land than any ten thousand\n Greeks, who had the most fertile and large estates. And he makes a very\n similar statement about Dionysius, in his twenty-first book, when he says,\n Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily encouraged above all others those who\n squandered their property in drunkenness and gambling and intemperance of that\n sort. For he wished every one to become ruined and ready for any iniquity, and\n all such people he treated with favour and distinction. \n \n ","77":"\n And Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very fond of mirth, as Phylarchus relates in\n the tenth book of his History. But in the fourteenth book he writes as\n follows:\u2014 Demetrius used to allow men to flatter him at his banquets, and\n to pour libations in his honour, calling him Demetrius the only king, and\n Ptolemy only the prefect of the flee, and Lysimachus only a steward, and\n Seleucus only a superintendent of elephants, and in this way he incurred no\n small amount of hatred. And Herodotus states that Amasis the king of the Egyptians was always a man full of tricks, and one\n who was used to turn his fellow feasters into ridicule; and when he was a private\n man he says he was very fond of feasting and of jesting, and he was not at all a\n serious man. And Nicolaus, in the twenty-seventh book of his History, says that\n Sylla the Roman general was so fond of mimics and buffoons, being a man very much\n addicted to amusement, that he gave such men several portions of the public land.\n And the satyric comedies which he wrote himself in his native language, show of\n how merry and jovial a temperament he was in this way. \n ","78":"\n And Theophrastus, in his treatise on Comedy, tells us that the Tirynthians, being\n people addicted to amusement, and utterly useless for all serious business, betook\n themselves once to the oracle at Delphi in hopes to be relieved from some calamity\n or other. And that the God answered them, That if they sacrificed a bull to\n Neptune and threw it into the sea without once laughing, the evil would\n cease. And they, fearing lest they should make a blunder in obeying the\n oracle, forbade any of the boys to be present at the sacrifice; however, one boy,\n hearing of what was going to be done, mingled with the crowd, and then when they\n hooted him and drove him away, Why, said he, are you afraid\n lest I should spoil your sacrifice? and when they laughed at this\n question of his, they perceived that the god meant to show them by a fact that an\n inveterate custom cannot be remedied. And Sosicrates, in the first book of his\n History of Crete, says that the Ph\u00e6stians have a certain peculiarity, for that\n they seem to practise saying ridiculous things from their earliest childhood; on\n which account it has often happened to them to say very reasonable and witty\n things because of their early habituation: and therefore all the Cretans attribute\n to them preeminence in the accomplishment of raising a laugh. \n ","79":"\n But after flattery, Anaxandrides the comic poet gives the next place to\n ostentation, in his Apothecary Prophet, speaking thus\u2014 \n Do you reproach me that I'm ostentatious? \n Why should you do so? for this quality \n Is far beyond all others, only flattery \n Excepted: that indeed is best of all. \n \n And Antiphanes speaks of what he calls a psomocolax, a\n flatterer for morsels of bread, in his Gerytades, when he says\u2014 \n You are call'd a whisperer and psomocolax. \n And Sannyrion says\u2014 \n What will become of you, you cursed psomocolaces. \n And Philemon says in his Woman made young again\u2014 \n The man is a psomocolax. \n And Philippides says in his Renovation\u2014 \n Always contending and \u03c8\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd. \n \n But the word \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03be especially applies to\n these parasitical flatterers; for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd means\n food, from which come the words \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, and\n \u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, which means difficult to be pleased\n and squeamish. And the word \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 means that part\n of the body which receives the food, that is to say, the stomach. Diphilus also\n uses the word \u03c8\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 in his Theseus, saying\u2014\n \n They call you a runaway \u03c8\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n \n \n ","80":"\n When Democritus had made this speech, and had asked for some drink in a\n narrow-necked sabrias, Ulpian said, And what is this sabrias? And just as\n Democritus was beginning to treat us all to a number of interminable stories, in\n came a troop of servants bringing in everything requisite for eating. Concerning\n whom Democritus, continuing his discourse, spoke as follows:\u2014I have always, O my\n friends, marvelled at the race of slaves, considering how abstemious they are,\n though placed in the middle of such numbers of dainties; for they pass them by,\n not only out of fear, but also because they are taught to do so; I do not mean\n being taught in the Slave-teacher of Pherecrates, but by early habituation; and\n without its being necessary to utter any express prohibition respecting such\n matters to them, as in the island of Cos, when the citizens sacrifice to Juno. For\n Macareus says, in his third book of his treatise on Coan Affairs, that, when the\n Coans sacrifice to Juno, no slave is allowed to enter the temple, nor does any\n slave taste any one of the things which are prepared for the sacrifice. And\n Antiphanes, in his Dyspratus, says\u2014 \n \n 'Tis hard to see around one savoury cakes, \n And delicate birds half eaten; yet the slaves \n Are not allow'd to eat the fragments even, \n As say the women. \n And Epicrates, in his Dyspratus, introduces a servant expressing his\n indignation, and saying\u2014 \n What can be worse than, while the guests are drinking, \n To hear the constant cry of, Here, boy, here! \n And this that one may bear a chamberpot \n To some vain beardless youth; and see around \n Half eaten savoury cakes, and delicate birds, \n Whose very fragments are forbidden strictly \n To all the slaves\u2014at least the women say so; \n And him who drinks a cup men call a belly-god; \n And if he tastes a mouthful of solid food \n They call him greedy glutton: \n from the comparison of which iambics, it is very plain that Epicrates\n borrowed Antiphanes's lines, and transferred them to his own play. \n ","81":"\n And Dieuchidas says, in his history of the Affairs of Megara\u2014 Around the\n islands called Ar\u00e6\u00e6 (and they are between Cnidos and Syme) a difference arose,\n after the death of Triopas, among those who had set out with him on his\n expedition, and some returned home, and others remained with Phorbas, and came\n to Ialysus, and others proceeded with Periergus, and occupied the district of\n Cameris. And on this it is said that Periergus uttered curses against Phorbas,\n and on this account the islands were called Ar\u00e6\u00e6. But Phorbas having met with\n shipwreck, he and Parthenia, the sister of Phorbas and Periergus, swam ashore\n to Ialysus, at the point called Schedia. And Thamneus met with them, as he\n happened to be hunting near Schedia, and took them to his own house, intending\n to receive them hospitably, and sent on a servant as a messenger to tell his\n wife to prepare everything necessary, as he was bringing home strangers. But\n when he came to his house and found nothing prepared, he himself put corn into\n a mill, and everything else that was requisite, and then ground it himself and\n feasted them. And Phorbas was so delighted with this hospitality, that when he\n was dying himself he charged his friends to take care that his funeral rites\n should be performed by free men. And so this custom continued to prevail in the\n sacrifice of Phorbas, for \n none but free men minister at this sacrifice. And it is\n accounted profanation for any slave to approach it \n \n ","82":"\n And since among the different questions proposed by Ulpian, there is this one\n about the slaves, let us now ourselves recapitulate a few things which we have to\n say on the subject, remembering what we have in former times read about it. For\n Pherecrates, in his Boors, says\u2014 \n For no one then had any Manes, no, \n Nor home-born slaves; but the free women themselves \n Did work at everything within the house. \n And so at morn they ground the corn for bread, \n Till all the streets resounded with the mills. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Anchises, says\u2014 \n There is not anywhere, my friend, a state \n Of none but slaves; but fortune regulates \n And changes at its will th' estates of men. \n Many there are who are not free to day, \n But will to-morrow free-men be of Sunium, \n And the day after public orators; \n For so the deity guides each man's helm. \n \n \n ","83":"\n And Posidonius, the stoic philosopher, says in the eleventh book of his History,\n \"That many men, who are unable to govern themselves, by reason of the weakness of\n their intellect, give themselves up to the guidance of those who are wiser than\n themselves, in order that receiving from them care and advice, and assistance in\n necessary matters, they may in their turn requite them with such services as they\n are able to render. And in this manner the Mariandyni became subject to the people\n of Heraclea, promising to act as their subjects for ever, if they would supply\n them with what they stood in need of; having made an agreement beforehand, that\n none of them would sell anything out of the territory of Heraclea, but that they\n would sell in that district alone. And perhaps it is on this account that\n Euphorion the epic poet called the Mariandyni Bringers of Gifts, saying\u2014 \n And they may well be call'd Bringers of Gifts, \n Fearing the stern dominion of their kings. \n And Callistratus the Aristophanean says that \"they called the Mariandyni\n \u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, by that appellation tang away\n whatever there is bitter in the name of servants, just as the \n Spartans did in respect of the Helots, the Thessalians in the case of the Penest\u00e6,\n and the Cretans with the Clarot\u00e6. But the Cretans call those servants who are in\n their houses Chrysoneti, and\n those whose work lies in the fields Amphamiot\u00e6, being natives of the country, but\n people who have been enslaved by the chance of war; but they also call the same\n people Clarot\u00e6, because they have been distributed among their masters by lot. \n And Ephorus, in the third book of his Histories, The Cretans call their\n slaves Clarot\u00e6, because lots have been drawn for them; and these slaves have\n some regularly recurring festivals in Cydonia, during which no freemen enter\n the city, but the slaves are the masters of everything, and have the right even\n to scourge the freemen. But Sosicrates, in the second book of his\n History of Cretan Affairs, says, \"The Cretans call public servitude \u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1, but the private slaves they call aphamiot\u00e6; and\n the peri\u0153ci, or people who live in the adjacent districts, they call subjects. And\n Dosiadas gives a very similar account in the fourth book of his history of Cretan\n Affairs. \n ","84":"\n But the Thessalians call those Penest\u00e6 who were not born slaves, but who have been\n taken prisoners in war. And Theopompus the comic poet, misapplying the word, says\u2014\n \n The wrinkled counsellors of a Penestan master. \n And Philocrates, in the second book of his history of the Affairs of\n Thessaly, if at least the work attributed to him is genuine, says that the Penest\u00e6\n are also called Thessal\u0153cet\u00e6, or servants of the Thessalians. And Archemachus, in\n the third book of his history of the Affairs of Eub\u0153a, says, \"When the B\u0153otians\n had founded Arn\u00e6a, those of them who did not return to B\u0153otia, but who took a\n fancy to their new country, gave themselves up to the Thessalians by agreement, to\n be their slaves; on condition that they should not take them out of the country,\n nor put them to death, but that they should cultivate the country for them, and\n pay them a yearly revenue for it. These men, therefore, abiding by their\n agreement, and giving themselves up to the Thessalians, were called at that time\n Menest\u00e6; but now they are called Penest\u00e6; and many of them\n are richer than their masters. And Euri- pides, in his Phrixus, calls them\n latri\u00e6, in these words\u2014 \n \n \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f01\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd. \n \n \n \n ","85":"\n And Tim\u00e6us of Tauromenium, in the ninth book of his Histories, says, It was\n not a national custom among the Greeks in former times to be waited on by\n purchased slaves; and he proceeds to say, And altogether they\n accused totle of having departed from the Locrian customs; said that it was not\n customary among the Locrians, nor among the Phocians, touse either\n maid-servants or house- servants till very lately. But the wife of Philomelus,\n who took Delphi, was the first woman who had two maids to follow her. And in a\n similar manner Mnason, the com- panion of Aristotle, was much reproached among\n the Pho- cians, for having purchased a thousand slaves; for they said that he\n was depriving that number of citizens of their neces- sary subsistence: for\n that it was a custom in their houses for the younger men to minister to the\n elder. \n \n ","86":"\n And Plato, in the sixth book of the Laws, says,\u2014\"The whole question about servants\n is full of difficulty; for of all the Greeks, the system of the Helots among the\n Laced\u00e6- monians causes the greatest perplexity and dispute, some people affirming\n that it is a wise institution, and some con- sidering it as of a very opposite\n character. But the system of slavery among the people of Heraclea would cause less\n dis- pute than the subject condition of the Mariandyni; and so too would the\n condition of the Thessalian Penest\u00e6. And if we con- sider all these things, what\n ought we to do with respect to the acquisition of servants? For there is nothing\n sound in the feelings of slaves; nor ought a prudent man to trust them in anything\n of importance. And the wisest of all poets says\u2014 \n Jove fix'd it certain that whatever day \n Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away. \n And it has been frequently shown by facts, that a slave in an\n objectionable and perilous possession; especially in the fre- quent revolts of the\n Messenians, and in the case of those cities which have many slaves, speaking\n different languages, in which many evils arise from that circumstance. And also we\n may come to the same conclusion from the exploits and sufferings of all sorts of\n robbers, who infest the Italian coasts as piratical\n vagabonds. And if any one considers all these cir- cumstances, he may well doubt\n what course ought to be pursued with respect to all these people. Two remedies now\n are left to us\u2014either never to allow, for the future, any person's slaves to be\n one another's fellow-countrymen, and, as far as possible, to prevent their even\n speaking the same language: and he should also keep them well, not only for their\n sake, but still more for his own; and he should behave towards them with as little\n insolence as possible. But it is right to chastise them with justice; not\n admonishing them as if they were free men, so as to make them arrogant: and every\n word which we address to slaves ought to be, in some sort, a command. And a man\n ought never to play at all with his slaves, or jest with them, whether they be\n male or female. And as to the very foolish way in which many people treat their\n slaves, allowing them great indulgence and great licence, they only make\n everything more difficult for both parties: they make obedience harder for the one\n to practise, and authority harder for the others to exercise. \n ","87":"\n Now of all the Greeks, I conceive that the Chians were the first people who used\n slaves purchased with money, as is related by Theopompus, in the seventeenth book\n of his Histories; where he says,\u2014 The Chians were the first of the Greeks,\n after the Thessalians and Laced\u00e6monians, who used slaves. But they did not\n acquire them in the same manner as those others did; for the Laced\u00e6monians and\n the Thessalians will be found to have derived their slaves from Greek tribes,\n who formerly inhabited the country which they now possess: the one having\n Achean slaves, but the Thessalians having Perrh\u00e6bian and Magnesian slaves; and\n the one nation called their slaves Helots, and the others called them Penest\u00e6.\n But the Chians have barbarian slaves, and they have bought them at a\n price. Theopompus, then, has given this account. But I think that, on\n this account, the Deity was angry with the Chians; for at a subsequent period they\n were subdued by their slaves. Accordingly, Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his\n Voyage along the Coast of Asia, gives this account of them:\u2014\"The slaves of the\n Chians deserted them, and escaped to the mountains; and then, collecting in great\n numbers, ravaged the country-houses about; for the island is very rugged, and much\n overgrown with trees. But, a little before our time, the\n Chians themselves relate, that one of their slaves deserted, and took up his\n habitation in the mountains; and, being a man of great courage and very prosperus\n in his warlike undertakings, he assumed the command o the runaway slaves, as a\n king would take the command of an army; and though the Chians often made\n expeditions against him, they were able to effect nothing. And when Drimacus (for\n that was the name of this runaway slave) found that they were being destroyed,\n without being able to effect anything, he addressed them in this language: 'O\n Chians! you who are the masters, this treatment which you are now receiving from\n your servants will never cease; for how should it cease, when it is God who causes\n it, in accordance with the prediction of the oracle? But if you will be guided by\n me, and if you will leave us in peace, then I will be the originator of much good\n fortune to you.' \n ","88":"\n \"Accordingly, the Chians, having entered into a treaty with him, and having made a\n truce for a certain time, Drimacus prepares measures and weights, and a private\n seal for himself; and, throwing it to the Chians, he said, Whatever I take from\n any one of you, I shall take according to these measures and these weights; and\n when I have taken enough, I will then leave the storehouses, having sealed them up\n with this seal. And as to all the slaves who desert from you, I will inquire what\n cause of complaint they have; and if they seem to me to have been really subject\n to any incurable oppression, which has been the reason of their running away, I\n will retain them with me; but if they have no sufficient or reasonable ground to\n allege, I will send them back to their masters.' Accordingly, the rest of the\n slaves, seeing that the Chians agreed to this state of things, very\n good-humouredly did not desert nearly so much for the future, fearing the judgment\n which Drimacus might pass upon them And the runaways who were with him feared him\n a great deal more than they did their own masters, and did everything that he\n required, obeying him as their general; for he punished the refractory with great\n severity: and he permitted no one to ravage the land, nor to commit any other\n crime of any sort, without his consent. And at the time of festivals, he went\n about, and took from the fields wine, and such animals for victims as were in good\n condition, and whatever else the masters were inclined or\n able to give him; and if he per- ceived that any one was intriguing against him,\n or laying any plot to injure him or overthrow his power, he chastised him. \n ","89":"\n \n Then (for the city had made a proclamation, that it would give a great\n reward to any one who took him prisoner, or who brought in his head,) this\n Drimacus, as he became older, calling one of his most intimate friends into a\n certain place, says to him, 'You know that I have loved you above all men, and\n you are to me as my child and my son, and as everything else. I now have lived\n long enough, but you are young and just in the prime of life. What, then, are\n we to do? You must show yourself a wise and brave man; for, since the city of\n the Chians offers a great reward to any one who shall kill me, and also\n promises him his freedom, you must cut off my head, and carry it to Chios, and\n receive the money which they offer, and so be prosperous.' But when the young\n man refused, he at last persuaded him to do so; and so he cut off his head, and\n took it to the Chians, and received from them the rewards which they had\n offered by proclamation: and, having buried the corpse of Drimacus, he departed\n to his own country. And the Chians, being again injured and plundered by their\n slaves, remembering the moderation of him who was dead, erected a Heroum in\n their country, and called it the shrine of the GENTLE HERO. And even now the\n runaway slaves bring to that shrine the first-fruits of all the plunder they\n get; and they say that Drimacus still appears to many of the Chians in their\n sleep, and informs them beforehand of the stratagems of their slaves who are\n plotting against them: and to whomsoever he appears, they come to that place,\n and sacrifice to him, where this shrine is. \n \n ","90":"\n Nymphodorus, then, has given this account; but in many copies of his history, I\n have found that Drimachus is not mentioned by name. But I do not imagine that any\n one of you is ignorant, either of what the prince of all historians, Herodotus,\n has related of the Chian Panionium, and of what he justly suffered who castrated\n free boys and sold them. But Nicolaus the Peripatetic, and Posidonius the Stoic,\n in their Histories, both state that the Chians were enslaved by Mithridates, the\n tyrant of Cappadocia; and were given up by him, bound, to their own slaves, for\n the purpose of being transported into the land of the\n Colchians,\u2014so really angry with them was the Deity, as being the first people who\n used purchased slaves, while most other nations provided for themselves by their\n own industry. And, perhaps, this s what the proverb originated in, A Chian\n bought a master, which is used by Eupolis, in his Friends. \n ","91":"\n But the Athenians, having a prudent regard to the condition of their slaves, made\n a law that there should be a \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u1f55\u03b2\u03c1\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2, even\n against men who ill treated their slaves. Accordingly, Hyperides, the orator, in\n his speech against Mnesitheus, on a charge of \u03b1\u1f30\u03ba\u03af\u03b1, says, They made these laws not only for the protection\n of freemen, but they enacted also, that even if any one personally ill treated\n a slave, there should be a power of preferring an indictment against him who\n had done so. And Lycurgus made a similar statement, in his first speech\n against Lycophron; and so did Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias. And\n Malacus, in his Annals of the Siphnians, relates that some slaves of the Samians\n colonized Ephesus, being a thousand men in number; who in the first instance\n revolted against their masters, and fled to the mountain which is in the island,\n and from thence did great injury to the Samians. But, in the sixth year after\n these occurrences, the Samians, by the advice of an oracle, made a treaty with the\n slaves, on certain agreements; and the slaves were allowed to depart uninjured\n from the island; and, sailing away, they occupied Ephesus, and the Ephesians are\n descended from these ancestors. \n ","92":"\n But Chrysippus says that there is a difference between a \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ; and he draws the\n distinction in the second book of his treatise on Similarity of Meaning, because\n he says that those who have been emancipated are still \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, but that the term \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 is\n confined to those who are not discharged from servitude; for the \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, says he is a \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, being actually at the time the property of a mast the\n following are called \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, as Clitarchus\n treatise on Dialects: \u1f04\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9, \n and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \n and \u1f00\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9, \n \n and \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, \n and \u1f51\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \n and also \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 and \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \n And Amerias says, that the slaves who are employed about the\n fields are called \u1f15\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. And Hermon, in his\n treatise on the Cretan Dialects, says that slaves of noble birth are called\n \u03bc\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2. And Seleucus says, that both men and\n maid servants are called \u1f04\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9 ; and that a female\n slave is often called \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 and \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03b7 ; and that a slave who is the son of a slave is\n called \u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd ; and that \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is a name properly belonging to a female slave who is\n about her mistress's person, and that a \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \n is one who walks before her mistress. \n But Proxenus, in the second book of his treatise on the Laced\u00e6monian Constitution,\n says that female servants are called among the Laced\u00e6monians, Chalcides. But Ion\n of Chios, in his Laertes, uses the word \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 as\n synonymous with \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, and says\u2014 \n Alas, O servant, go on wings and close \n The house lest any man should enter in. \n And Ach\u00e6us, in his Omphale, speaking of the Satyr, says\u2014 \n How rich in slaves ( \u03b5\u1f54\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) and how well\n housed he was ( \u03b5\u1f54\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ); \n using, however, in my opinion, the words \u03b5\u1f54\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b5\u1f54\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 in a peculiar\n sense, as meaning rather, good to his slaves and servants, taking \u03b5\u1f54\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 from \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2. \n And it is generally understood that an \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 is\n a servant whose business is confined to the house, and that it is possible he may\n be a freeborn man. \n ","93":"\n But the poets of the old comedy, speaking of the old-fashioned way of life, and\n asserting that in olden time there was no great use of slaves, speak in this way.\n Cratinus, in his Pluti, says\u2014 \n As for those men, those heroes old, \n Who lived in Saturn's time, \n When men did play at dice with loaves, \n And Aeginetan cakes \n Of barley well and brownly baked \n Were roll'd down before men \n Who did in the pal\u00e6stra toil, \n Full of hard lumps of dough . . . . \n \n And Crates says, in his Beasts\u2014 \n \n A.

Philippus\n of Theangela, in his treatise on the Carians and Leleges, having made mention of\n the Helots of the Laced\u00e6monians and of the Thessalian Penest\u00e6, says, The\n Carians also, both in former times, and down to the present day, use the\n Leleges as slaves. But Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his History,\n says that the Byzantians used the Bithynians in the same manner, just as the\n Laced\u00e6monians do the Helots. But respecting those who among the Laced\u00e6monians are\n called Epeunacti, and they also are slaves, Theopompus gives a very clear account\n in the thirty-second book of his History, speaking as follows:\u2014 When many of\n the Laced\u00e6monians had been slain in the war against the Messenians, those who\n were left being afraid lest their enemies should become aware of their desolate\n condition, put some of the Helots into the beds of those who were dead; and\n afterwards they made those men citizens, and called them Epeunacti, because\n they had been put into the beds of those who were dead instead of\n them. And the same writer also tells us, in the\n thirty-third book of his History, that among the Sicyonians there are some slaves\n who are called Catonacophori, being very similar to the Epeunacti. And Men\u00e6chmus\n gives a similar account in his History of the affairs of Sicyon, and says that\n there are some slaves called Catonacophori, who very much resemble the Epeunacti.\n And again, Theopompus, in the second book of his Philippics, says that the\n Arcadians had three hundred thousand slaves, whom they called Prospelat\u00e6, like the\n Helots. \n ","101":"\n But the class called Mothaces among the Laced\u00e6monians are freemen, but still not\n citizens of Laced\u00e6mon. And Phylarchus speaks of them thus, in the twenty-fifth\n book of his History\u2014 But the Mothaces are foster-brothers of Laced\u00e6monian\n citizens. For each of the sons of the citizens has one or two, or even more\n foster-brothers, according as their circumstances admit. The Mothaces are\n freemen then, but still not Laced\u00e6monian citizens; but they shard all the\n education which is given to the free citizens; and they say that Lysander, who\n defeated the Athenians in the naval battle, was one of that class, having been\n made a citizen on account of his preeminent valour. And Myron of\n Priene, in the second book of his history of the Affairs of Messene, says,\n The Laced\u00e6monians often emancipated their slaves, and some of them when\n emancipated they called Aphet\u00e6, and some they called\n Adespoti, and some they called Erycteres, and others they called\n Desposionaute, whom they put on board their fleets, and some they called\n Neodamodes, but all these were different people from the Helots. \n And Theopompus, in the seventh book of his history of the Affairs of Greece,\n speaking of the Helots that they were also called Eleat\u00e6, writes as follows:\u2014\"But\n the nation of the Helote is altogether a fierce and cruel race. For they are\n people who have been enslaved a long time ago by the Spar- tans, some of them\n being Messenians, and some Eleat\u00e6, who formerly dwelt in that part of Laconia\n called Helos. \n ","102":"\n But Tim\u00e6us of Tauromenium, forgetting himself, (and Polybius the Megalopolitan\n attacks him for the assertion, in the twelfth book of his\n Histories,) says that it is not usual for the Greeks to possess slaves. But the\n same man, writing under the name of Epitim\u00e6us, (and this is what Ister the pupil\n of Callimachus calls him in the treatise which he wrote against him,) says that\n Mnason the Phocian had more than a thousand slaves. And in the third book of his\n History, Epitim\u00e6us said that the city of the Corinthians was so flourishing that\n it possessed four hundred and sixty thousand slaves. On which account I imagine it\n was that the Pythian priestess called them The People who measured with a Ch\u0153nix.\n But Ctesicles, in the third book of his Chronicles, says that in the hundred and\n fifteenth Olympiad, there was an investigation at Athens conducted by Demetrius\n Phalereus into the number of the inhabitants of Attica, and the Athenians were\n found to amount, to twenty-one thousand, and the Metics to ten thousand, and the\n slaves to four hundred thousand. But Nicias the son of Niceratus, as that\n admirable writer Xenophon has said in his book on Revenues, when he had a thousand\n servants, let them out to Sosias the Thracian to work in the silver mines, on\n condition of his paying him an obol a day for every one of them. And Aristotle, in\n his history of the Constitution of the Aeginet\u00e6, says that the Aeginetans had four\n hundred and seventy thousand slaves. But Agatharchides the Cnidian, in the\n thirty-eighth book of his history of the Affairs of Europe, says that the\n Dardanians had great numbers of slaves, some of them having a thousand, and some\n even more; and that in time of peace they were all employed in the cultivation of\n the land; but that in time of war they were all divided into regiments, each set\n of slaves having their own master for their commander. \n ","103":"\n After all these statements, Laurentius rose up and said,\u2014But each of the Romans\n (and this is a fact with which you are well acquainted, my friend Masyrius) had a\n great many slaves. For many of them had ten thousand or twenty thousand, or even a\n greater number, not for the purposes of income, as the rich Nicias had among the\n Greeks; but the greater part of the Romans when they go forth have a large retinue\n of slaves accompanying them. And out of the myriads of Attic slaves, the greater\n part worked in the mines, being kept in chains: at all events Posidonius, whom you\n are often quoting, the philosopher I mean, says that once \n they revolted and put to death the guards of the mines; and that they seized on\n the Acropolis on Sunium, and that for a very long time they ravaged Attica. And\n this was the time when the second revolt of the slaves took place in Sicily. And\n there were many revolts of the slaves, and more than a million of slaves were\n destroyed in them. And C\u00e6cilius, the orator from Cale Acte, wrote a treatise on\n the Servile Wars. And Spartacus the gladiator, having escaped from Capua, a city\n of Italy, about the time of the Mithridatic war, prevailed on a great body of\n slaves to join him in the revolt, (and he himself was a slave, being a Thracian by\n birth,) and overran the whole of Italy for a considerable time, great numbers of\n slaves thronging daily to his standard. And if he had not died in a battle fought\n against Licinius Crassus, he would have caused no ordinary trouble to our\n countrymen, as Eunus did in Sicily. \n ","104":"\n But the ancient Romans were prudent citizens, and eminent for all kinds of good\n qualities. Accordingly Scipio, surnamed Africanus, being sent out by the Senate to\n arrange all the kingdoms of the world, in order that they might be put into the\n hands of those to whom they properly belonged, took with him only five slaves, as\n we are informed by Polybius and Posidonius. And when one of them died on the\n journey, he sent to his agents at home to bring him another instead of him, and to\n send him to him. And Julius C\u00e6sar, the first man who ever crossed over to the\n British isles with a thousand vessels, had with him only three servants\n altogether, as Cotta, who at that time acted as his lieutenant-general, relates in\n his treatise on the History and Constitution of the Romans, which is written in\n our national language. But Smindyrides the Sybarite was a very different sort of\n man, my Greek friends, who, when he went forth to marry Agaroste, the daughter of\n Cleisthenes, carried his luxury and ostentation to such a height, that he took\n with him a thousand slaves, fishermen, bird-catchers, and cooks. But this man,\n wishing to display how magnificently he was used to live, according to the account\n given to us by Cham\u00e6leon of Pontus, in his book on Pleasure, (but the same book is\n also attribute to Theophrastus,) said that for twenty years he had never seen the\n sun rise or set; and this he considered a great and marvellous proof of his wealth\n and happiness. For he, as it seems, used to go to bed early\n in the morning, and to get up in the even- ing, being in my opinion a miserable\n man in both particulars. But Histi\u00e6us of Pontus boasted, and it was an honourable\n boast, that he had never once seen the sun rise or set, because he had been at all\n times intent upon study, as we are told by Nicias of Nic\u00e6a in his Successions. \n ","105":"\n What then are we to think? Had not Scipio and Caesar any slaves? To be sure they\n had, but they abided by the laws of their country, and lived with moderation,\n preserving the habits sanctioned by the constitution. For it is the conduct of\n prudent men to abide by those ancient institutions under which they and their\n ancestors have lived, and made war upon and subdued the rest of the world; and\n yet, at the same time, if there were any useful or honourable institutions among\n the people whom they have subdued, those they take for their imitation at the same\n time that they take the prisoners. And this was the conduct of the Romans in olden\n time; for they, maintaining their national customs, at the same time introduced\n from the nations whom they had subdued every relic of desirable practices which\n they found, leaving what was useless to them, so that they should never be able to\n regain what they had lost. Accordingly they learnt from the Greeks the use of all\n machines and engines for conducting sieges; and with those engines they subdued\n the very people of whom they had learnt them. And when the Ph\u0153nicians had made\n many discoveries in nautical science, the Romans availed themselves of these very\n discoveries to subdue them. And from the Tyrrhenians they derived the practice of\n the entire army advancing to battle in close phalanx; and from the Samnites they\n learnt the use of the shield, and from the Iberians the use of the javelin. And\n learning different things from different people, they improved upon them: and\n imitating in everything the constitution of the Laced\u00e6monians, they preserved it\n better than the Laced\u00e6monians themselves; but now, having selected whatever was\n useful from the practices of their enemies, they have at the same time turned\n aside to imitate them in what is vicious and mischievous. \n ","106":"\n For, as Posidonius tells us, their national mode of life was originally temperate\n and simple, and they used everything which they possessed in an unpretending and\n unosten- tatious manner. Moreover they displayed wonderful\n piety towards the Deity, and great justice, and great care to behave equitably\n towards all men, and great diligence in cultivating the earth. And we may see this\n from the national sacrifices which we celebrate. For we proceed by ways regularly\n settled and defined. So that we bear regularly appointed offerings, and we utter\n regular petitions in our prayers, an we perform stated acts in all our sacred\n ceremonies. They are also simple and plain. And we do all this without being\n either clothed or attired as to our persons in any extraordinary manner, and\n without indulging in any extraordinary pomp when offering the first-fruits. But we\n wear simple garments and shoes, and on our heads we have rough hats made of the\n skins of sheep, and we carry vessels to minister in of earthenware and brass. And\n in these vessels we carry those meats and liquors which are procured with the\n least trouble, thinking it absurd to send offerings to the gods in accordance with\n our national customs, but to provide for ourselves according to foreign customs.\n And, therefore, all the things which are expended upon ourselves are measured by\n their use; but what we offer. to the gods are a sort of first- fruits of them. \n ","107":"\n Now Mucius Sc\u00e6vola was one of the three men in Rome who were particular in their\n observance of the Fannian law; Quintus Aelius Tubero and Rutilius Rufus being the\n other two, the latter of whom is the man who wrote the History of his country.\n Which law enjoined men not to entertain more than three people besides those in\n the house; but on market-days a man might entertain five. And these market-days\n happened three times in the month. The law also forbade any one to spend in\n provisions more than two drachm\u00e6 and a half. And they were allowed to spend\n fifteen talents a-year on cured meat and whatever vegetables the earth produces,\n and on boiled pulse. But as this allowance was insufficient, men gradually\n (because those who transgressed the law and spent money lavishly raised the price\n of whatever was to be bought) advanced to a more liberal style of living without\n violating the law. For Tubero used to buy birds at a drachma a-piece from the men\n who lived on his own farms. And Rutilius used to buy fish from his own slaves who\n worked as fishermen for three obols for a pound of fish; \n especially when he could get what is called the Thurian; and that is a part of the\n sea-dog which goes by that name. But Mucius agreed with those who were benefited\n by him to pay for all he bought at a similar valuation. Out of so many myriads of\n men then these were the only ones who kept the law with a due regard to their\n oaths; and who never received even the least present; but they gave large presents\n to others, and especially to those who had been brought up at the same school with\n them. For they all clung to the doctrines of the Stoic school. \n ","108":"\n But of the extravagance which prevails at the present time Lucullus was the first\n oiiginator, he who subdued Mithridates, as Nicolaus the Peripatetic relates. For\n he, coming to Rome after the defeat of Mithridates, and also after that of\n Tigranes, the king of Armenia, and having triumphed, and having given in an\n account of his exploits in war, proceeded to an extravagant way of living from his\n former simplicity, and was the first teacher of luxury to the Romans, having\n amassed the wealth of the two before-mentioned kings. But the famous Cato, as\n Polybius tells us in the thirty-fourth book of his History, was very indignant,\n and cried out, that some men had introduced foreign luxury into Rome, having\n bought an earthen jar of pickled fish from Pontus for three hundred drachm\u00e6, and\n some beautiful boys at a higher price than a man might buy a field. \n \n But in former times the inhabitants of Italy were so easily contented, that\n even now, says Posidonius, those who are in very easy\n circumstances are used to accustom their sons to drink as much water as\n possible, and to eat whatever they can get. And very often, says he,\n the father or mother asks their son whether he chooses to have pears or\n nuts for his supper; and then he, eating some of these things, is contented and\n goes to bed. But now, as Theopompus tells us in the first book of his\n history of the Actions of Philip, there is no one of those who are even tolerably\n well off who does not provide a most sumptuous table, and who has not cooks and a\n great many more attendants, and who does not spend more on his daily living than\n formerly men used to spend on their festivals and sacrifices. \n And since now this present discussion has gone far enough, let us end this book at\n this point. \n "},"6":{"0":"\n AND when the Banquet was now finished, the cynics, thinking that the festival of\n the Phagesia was being celebrated, were delighted above all things, and Cynulcus\n said, \u2014While we are supping, O Ulpian, since it is on words that you are feasting\n us, I propose to you this question,\u2014In what author do you find any mention of the\n festivals called Phagesia, and Phagesiposia? And he, hesitating, and bidding the\n slaves desist from carrying the dishes round, though it was now evening, said,\u2014I\n do not recollect, you very wise man, so that you may tell us yourself, in order\n that you may sup more abundantly and more pleasantly. And he rejoined, \u2014If you\n will promise to thank me when I have told you, I will tell you. And as he agreed\n to thank him, he continued; \u2014Clearchus, the pupil of Aristotle, but a Solensian by\n birth, in the first book of his treatise on Pictures, (for I recollect his very\n expressions, because I took a great fancy to them,) speaks as\n follows:\u2014 Phagesia\u2014but some call the festival Phagesiposia\u2014but this\n festival has ceased, as also has that of the Rhapsodists, which they celebrated\n about the time of the Dionysiac festival, in which every one as they passed by\n sang a hymn to the god by way of doing him honour. This is what\n Clearchus wrote. And if you doubt it, my friend, I, who have got the book, will\n not mind lending it to you. And you may learn a good deal from it, and get a great\n many questions to ask us out of it. For he relates that Calias the Athenian\n composed a Grammatical Tragedy, from which Euripides in his Medea, and Sophocles\n in his \u0152dipus derived their choruses and the arrangement of their plot. \n ","1":"\n And when all the guests marvelled at the literary accomplishments of Cynulcus,\n Plutarch said,\u2014In like manner there used to be celebrated in my own Alexandria a\n Flagon-bearing festival, which is mentioned by Eratosthenes in his treatise\n entitled Arsinoe. And he speaks as follows:\u2014 When Ptolemy was instituting a\n festival and all kinds of sacrifices, and especially those\n which relate to Bacchus, Arsinoe asked the man who bore the branches, what day\n he was celebrating now, and what festival it was. And when he replied, 'It is\n called the Lagynophoria; and the guests lie down on beds and so eat all that\n they have brought with them, and every one drinks out of his own flagon which\n he has brought from home;' and when he had departed, she, looking towards us,\n said, 'It seems a very dirty kind of party; for it is quite evident that it\n must be an assembly of a mixed multitude, all putting down stale food and such\n as is altogether unseasonable and unbecoming.' But if the kind of feast had\n pleased her, then the queen would not have objected to preparing the very same\n things herself, as is done at the festival called Choes. For there every one\n feasts separately, and the inviter only supplies the materials for the\n feast. \n \n ","2":"\n But one of the Grammarians who were present, looking on the preparation of the\n feast, said,\u2014In the next place, how shall we ever be able to eat so large a\n supper? Perhaps we are to go on during the night, as that witty\n writer Aristophanes says in his Aeolosicon, where however his expression is\n during the whole night. And, indeed, Homer uses the preposition\n \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 in the same way, for he says\u2014 \n He lay within the cave stretch'd o'er the sheep ( \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70\n \u03bc\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd ); \n where \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03bc\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd means over all the sheep, indicating the size of the giant.\n And Daphnus the physician answered him; Meals taken late at night, my friend, are\n more advantageous for everybody. For the influence of the moon is well adapted to\n promote the digestion of food, since the moon has putrefying properties; and\n digestion depends upon putrefaction. Accordingly victims slain at night are more\n digestible; and wood which is cut down by moonlight decays more rapidly. And also\n the greater proportion of fruits ripen by moonlight. \n ","3":"\n But since there were great many sorts of fish, and those very different both as to\n size and beauty, which had been served up and which were still being constantly\n served up for the guests, Myrtilus said,\u2014Although all the different dishes which\n we eat, besides the regular meal, are properly called by one generic name,\n \u1f44\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd, still it is very deservedly that on\n account of its delicious taste fish has prevailed over everything else, and has\n appropriated the name to itself; because men are so\n exceedingly enamoured of this kind of food. Accordingly we speak of men as\n \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9, not meaning people who eat beef (such\n as Hercules was, who ate beef and green figs mixed together); nor do we mean by\n such a term a man who is fond of figs; as was Plato the philosopher, according to\n the account given of him by Phanocritus in his treatise on the Glorious: and he\n tells us in the same book that Arcesilas was fond of grapes: but we mean by the\n term only those people who haunt the fish-market. And Philip of Macedon was fond\n of apples, and so was his son Alexander, as Dorotheus tells us in the sixth book\n of his history of the Life and Actions of Alexander. But Chares of Mitylene\n relates that Alexander, having found the finest apples which he had ever seen in\n the country around Babylon, filled boats with them, and had a battle of apples\n from the vessels, so as to present a most beautiful spectacle. And I am not\n ignorant that, properly speaking, whatever is prepared for being eaten by the\n agency of fire is called \u1f44\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd. For indeed the word\n is either identical with \u1f10\u03c8\u1f78\u03bd, or else perhaps it\n is derived from \u1f40\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac\u03c9, to roast. \n ","4":"\n Since then there are a great many different kinds of fish which we eat at\n different seasons, my most admirable Timocrates, (for, as Sophocles says\u2014 \n A chorus too of voiceless fish rush'd on, \n Making a noise with their quick moving tails. \n The tails not fawning on their mistress, but beating against the dish.\n And as Ach\u00e6us says in his Fates\u2014 \n There was a mighty mass of the sea-born herd\u2014 \n A spectacle which fill'd the wat'ry waste, \n Breaking the silence with their rapid tails;) \n I will now recapitulate to you what the Deipnosophists said about each:\n for each of them brought to the discussion of the subject some contribution of\n quotation from books; though I will not mention the names of all who took part in\n the conversation, they were so numerous. \n Amphis says in his Leucas\u2014 \n Whoever buys some \u1f44\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd for his supper, \n And, when he might get real genuine fish, \n Contents himself with radishes, is mad. \n And that you may find it easy to remember what was said, I will arrange\n the names in alphabetical order For as Sophocles, in his Ajax\n Mastigophorus, called fish \u1f10\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76, saying\u2014 \n He gave him to the \u1f10\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 to eat; \n one of the company asked whether any one before Sophocles ever used this\n word; to whom Zoilus replied,\u2014But I, who am not a person \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 [exceedingly fond of fish], (for that is a word which\n Xenophon has used in his Memorabilia, where he writes, He is \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 and the greatest fool\n possible, ) am well aware that the man who wrote the poem Titanomachia [or\n the Battle of the Giants], whether he be Eumelus the Corinthian, or Arctinus, or\n whatever else his name may chance to have been, in the second book of his poem\n speaks thus\u2014 \n In it did swim the gold-faced \u1f10\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2, \n \n And sported in the sea's ambrosial depths. \n And Sophocles was very fond of the Epic Cycle, so that he composed even\n entire plays in which he has followed the stories told in their fables. \n ","5":"\n Presently when the tunnies called Ami\u00e6 were put on the table, some one\n said,\u2014Aristotle speaks of this fish, and says that they have gills out of sight,\n and that they have very sharp teeth, and that they belong to the gregarious and\n carnivorous class of fishes: and that they have a gall of equal extent with their\n whole intestines, and a spleen of corresponding proportions. It is said also that\n when they are hooked, they leap up towards the fisherman, and bite through the\n line and so escape. And Archippus mentions them in his play entitled the Fishes,\n where he says\u2014 \n But when you were eating the fat ami\u00e6. \n And Epicharmus in his Sirens says\u2014 \n \n A. In the morning early, at the break of day, \n We roasted plump anchovies, \n Cutlets of well-fed pork, and polypi; \n And then we drank sweet wine. \n \n B. Alack! alack! my silly wife detain'd me, \n Chattering near the monument. \n \n A. I'm sorry for you. Then, too, there were\n mullets \n And large plump ami\u00e6\u2014 \n A noble pair i' the middle of the table, \n And eke a pair of pigeons, \n A scorpion and a lobster. \n And Aristotle, inquiring into the etymology of the name, says that they\n were called ami\u00e6, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f05\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f30\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1- \n \n \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 (from their going in shoals with their\n companions of the same kind). But Icesius, in his treatise on the Materials of\n Food, says that they are full of a wholesome juice, and tender, but only of\n moderate excellency as far as their digestible properties go, and not very\n nutritious. \n ","6":"\n But Archestratus,\u2014that writer so curious in all that relates to cookery,\u2014in his\n Gastrology (for that is the title of the book as it is given by Lycophron, in his\n treatise on Comedy, just as the work of Cleostratus of Tenedos is called\n Astrology), speaks thus of the amia:\u2014 \n But towards the end of autumn, when the Pleiad \n Has hidden its light, then dress the ami\u00e6 \n Whatever way you please. Why need I teach you? \n For then you cannot spoil it, if you wish. \n But if you should desire, Moschus my friend, \n To know by what recipe you best may dress it; \n Take the green leaves of fig-trees, and some marjoram, \n But not too much; no cheese or other nonsense, \n But merely wrap it up in the fig leaves, \n And tie it round with a small piece of string, \n Then bury it beneath the glowing ashes, \n Judging by instinct of the time it takes \n To be completely done without being burnt. \n And if you wish to have the best o' their kind, \n Take care to get them from Byzantium; \n Or if they come from any sea near that \n They'll not be bad: but if you go down lower, \n And pass the straits into the Aeg\u00e6an sea, \n They're quite a different thing, in flavour worse \n As well as size, and merit far less praise. \n \n \n ","7":"\n But this Archestratus was so devoted to luxury, that he travelled over every\n country and every sea, with great diligence, wishing, as it seems to me, to seek\n out very carefully whatever related to his stomach; and, as men do who write\n Itineraries and Books of Voyages, so he wishes to relate everything with the\n greatest accuracy, and to tell where every kind of eatable is to be got in the\n greatest perfection; for this is what he professes himself, in the preface to his\n admirable Book of Precepts, which he addresses to his companions, Moschus and\n Cleander; enjoining them, as the Pythian priestess says, to seek \n A horse from Thessaly, a wife from Sparta, \n And men who drink at Arethusa's fount. \n And Chrysippus, a man who was a genuine philosopher, and a thorough man\n at all points, says that he was the teacher of Epicurus, and\n of all those who follow his rules, in everything which belongs to pleasure, which\n is the ruin of everything. For Epicurus says, without any concealment, but\n speaking with a loud voice, as it were, For I am not able to distinguish\n what is good if you once take away the pleasure arising from sweet flavours,\n and if you also take away amatory pleasures. For this wise man thinks\n that even the life of the intemperate man is an unimpeachable one, if he enjoys an\n immunity from fear, and also mirth. On which account also the comic poets, running\n down the Epicureans, attack them as mere servants and ministers of pleasure and\n intemperance. \n ","8":"\n Plato, in his Joint Deceiver, representing a father as indignant with his son's\n tutor, makes him say\u2014 \n \n A. You've taken this my son, and ruin'd him, \n You scoundrel; you've persuaded him to choose \n A mode of life quite foreign to his nature \n And disposition; taught by your example, \n He drinks i' the morning, which he ne'er was used to do. \n \n B. Do you blame me, master, that your son \n Has learnt to live? \n \n A. But do you call that living? \n \n B. Wise men do call it so. And Epicurus \n Tells us that pleasure is the only good. \n \n A. Indeed; I never heard that rule before. \n Does pleasure come then from no other source? \n Is not a virtuous life a pleasure now? \n Will you not grant me that?\u2014Tell me, I pray you, \n Did you e'er see a grave philosopher \n Drunk, or devoted to these joys you speak of? \n \n B. Yes; all of them.-All those who raise their\n brows, \n Who walk about the streets for wise men seeking, \n As if they had escaped their eyes and hid: \n Still when a turbot once is set before them, \n Know how to help themselves the daintiest bits. \n They seek the head and most substantial parts, \n As if they were an argument dissecting, \n So that men marvel at their nicety. \n And in his play entitled the Homicide, the same Plato, laughing at one of\n those gentle philosophers, says\u2014 \n The man who has a chance to pay his court \n To a fair woman, and at eve to drink \n Two bottles full of richest Lesbian wine, \n Must be a wise man; these are real goods. \n These things I speak of are what Epicurus \n Tells us are real joys; and if the world \n All lived the happy life I live myself, \n There would not be one wicked man on earth. \n \n And Hegesippus, in his Philetairi, says\u2014 \n That wisest Epicurus, when a man \n Once ask'd him what was the most perfect good \n Which men should constantly be seeking for, \n Said pleasure is that good. Wisest and best \n Of mortal men, full truly didst thou speak: \n For there is nothing better than a dinner, \n And every good consists in every pleasure. \n \n \n ","9":"\n But the Epicureans are not the only men who are addicted to pleasure; but those\n philosophers are so too who belong to what are called the Cyrenaic and the\n Mnesistratean sects; for these men delight to live luxuriously, as Posidonius\n tells us. And Speusippus did not much differ from them, though he was a pupil and\n a relation of Plato's. At all events, Dionysius the tyrant, in his letters to him,\n enumerating all the instances of his devotion to pleasure, and also of his\n covetousness, and reproaching him with having levied contributions on numbers of\n people, attacks him also on account of his love for Lasthenea, the Arcadian\n courtesan. And, at the end of all, he says this\u2014 Whom do you charge with\n covetousness, when you yourself omit no opportunity of amassing base gain? For\n what is there that you have been ashamed to do? Are you not now attempting to\n collect contributions, after having paid yourself for Hermeas all that he\n owed? \n \n ","10":"\n And about Epicurus, Timon, in the third book of his Silli, speaks as follows:\u2014\n \n Seeking at all times to indulge his stomach, \n Than which there's no more greedy thing on earth. \n For, on account of his stomach, and of the rest of his sensual pleasures,\n the man was always flattering Idomeneus and Metrodorus. And Metrodorus himself,\n not at all disguising this admirable principle of his, says, somewhere or other,\n The fact is, Timocrates, my natural philosopher, that every\n investigation which is guided by principles of nature, fixes its ultimate aim\n entirely on gratifying the stomach. For Epicurus was the tutor of all\n these men; who said, shouting it out, as I may say, The fountain and root\n of every good is the pleasure of the stomach: and all wise rules, and all\n superfluous rules, are measured alike by this standard. And in his\n treatise on the Chief Good, he speaks nearly as follows: For I am not able\n to understand what is good, if I leave out of consideration the pleasures which\n arise from delicately-flavoured food, and if I also leave\n out the pleasures which arise from amatory indulgences; and if I also omit\n those which arise from music, and those, too, which are derived from the\n contemplation of beauty and the gratification of the eyesight. And,\n proceeding a little further, he says, \"All that is beautiful is naturally to be\n honoured; and so is virtue, and everything of that sort, if it assists in\n producing or causing pleasure. But if it does not contribute to that end, then it\n may be disregarded. \n ","11":"\n And before Epicurus, Sophocles, the tragic poet, in his Antigone, had uttered\n these sentiments respecting pleasure\u2014 \n For when a man contemns and ceases thus \n To seek for pleasure, I do not esteem \n That such an one doth live; I only deem him \n A breathing corpse:\u2014he may, indeed, perhaps \n Have store of wealth within his joyless house; \n He may keep up a kingly pomp and state; \n But if these things be not with joy attended, \n They are mere smoke and shadow, and contribute, \n No, not one jot, to make life enviable. \n And Philet\u00e6rus says, in his Huntress,\u2014 \n For what, I pray you, should a mortal do, \n But seek for all appliances and means. \n To make his life from day to day pass happily? \n This should be all our object and our aim, \n Reflecting on the chance of human life. \n And never let us think about to-morrow, \n Whether it will arrive at all or not. \n It is a foolish trouble to lay up \n Money which may become stale and useless. \n And the same poet says, in his \u0152nopion,\u2014 \n But every man who lives but sparingly, \n Having sufficient means, I call and think \n Of all men the most truly miserable. \n For when you're dead, you cannot then eat eels; \n No wedding feasts are cook'd in Pluto's realms. \n \n \n ","12":"\n And Apollodorus the Carystian, in his Stirrer-up of Law-suits, says\u2014 \n O men, whoe'er you are, why do you now \n Scorn pleasant living, and turn all your thoughts \n To do each other mischief in fierce war? \n In God's name, tell me, does some odious fate, \n Rude and unlettered, destitute of all \n That can be knowledge call'd, or education, \n Ignorant of what is bad and what is good, \n Guide all your destiny?\u2014a fate which settles \n \n All your affairs at random by mere chance? \n I think it must be so: for else, what deity \n Who bears a Grecian heart, would ever choose \n To see Greeks by each other thus despoil'd, \n And falling dead in ghastly heaps of corpses, \n When she might see them sportive, gay, and jesting, \n Drinking full cups, and singing to the flute? \n Tell me, my friend, I pray, and put to shame \n This most unpolish'd clownish fortune. \n And, presently afterwards, he says\u2014 \n Does not a life like this deserve the name \n Of godlike?\u2014Think how far more pleasant all \n Affairs would be in all the towns of Greece \n Than now they are, if we were but to change \n Our fashions, and our habits, and our principles \n One little bit. Why should we not proclaim, \n \"Whoe'er is more than thirty years of age, \n Let him come forth and drink. Let all the cavalry \n Go to a feast at Corinth, for ten days, \n Crown'd with chaplets, and perfumed most sweetly. \n Let all who radishes have got to sell \n Come in the morning here from Megara. \n Bid all th' allies now hasten to the bath, \n And mix in cups the rich Eub\u0153an wine? \"\u2014 \n Sure this is real luxury and life, \n But we are slaves to a most clownish fortune. \n \n \n ","13":"\n The poets say that that ancient hero, Tantalus, was also greatly devoted to\n pleasure. At all events, the author of the book called The Return of the Atrid\u00e6\n says that he, when he had arrived among the gods, and had begun to live\n among them, had leave given him by Jupiter to ask for whatever he wished; and\n that he, being a man quite insatiable in the gratification of his appetites,\n asked that it might be granted to him to indulge them to their full extent, and\n to live in the same manner as the gods. And that Jupiter was indignant at this\n request, and, according to his promise, fulfilled his prayer; but still, that\n he might not enjoy what he had before him, but be everlastingly tormented, he\n hung a stone over his head, on account of which he should be unable to get at\n any of the things which he had before him. Some of the Stoics also were\n addicted to this kind of pleasure At all events, Eratosthenes the Cyrenean, who\n was a pupil of Ariston the Chian, who was one of the sect of the Stoics, in his\n treatise which is entitled Ariston, represents his master as subsequently being\n much addicted to luxury, speaking a follows: \n And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it were,\n the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on the side of\n pleasure. And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of Ariston), in\n his Ariston (for he also wrote a book with that title), shows the way in which his\n master was addicted to pleasure. And why need we mention Dionysius of Heraclea?\n who openly discarded his covering of virtue, and put on a robe embroidered with\n flowers, and assumed the name of The altered Man; and, although he was an old man,\n he apostatized from the doctrines of the Stoics, and passed over to the school of\n Epicurus; and, in consequence, Timon said of him, not without some point and\n felicity\u2014 \n When it is time to set ( \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ), he now\n begins \n To sit at table ( \u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ).

And they say that they are usually\n caught in couples, and that one is always found following at the tail of the\n other; and therefore, from the fact of one following close on the tail of the\n other, some of the ancients call men who are intemperate and libidinous by the\n same name. But Aristotle, in his work on Animals, says that this fish, which he\n calls alphesticus, has but a single spine, and is of a tawny colour. And Numenius\n of Heraclea mentions it, in his treatise on Fishing, speaking as follows:\u2014 \n The fish that lives in seaweed, the alphestes, \n The scorpion also with its rosy meat. \n And Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe, says\u2014 \n Mussels, alphet\u00e6, and the girl-like fish, \n The dainty coracinus. \n Mith\u00e6cus also mentions it in his Culinary Art. \n ","15":"\n There is another fish called Anthias, or Callicthys; and this also is mentioned by\n Epicharmus, in his Marriage or Hebe:\u2014 \n \n The sword-fish and the chromius too, \n Who, as Ananius tells us, \n Is far the best of all in spring; \n But th' anthias in the winter. \n And Ananius speaks as follows:\u2014 \n For spring the chromius is best; \n The anthias in winter: \n But of all fish the daintiest \n Is a young shrimp in fig leaves. \n In autumn there's a dainty dish, \n The meat of the she-goat; \n And when they pick and press the grapes, \n Young pigs are dainty eating. \n Then, too, young puppies you may eat, \n And hares, and also foxes. \n But when the grasshopper does sing, \n Just at the height of summer, \n Is the best time for mutton fat; \n Then, too, the sea-born tunny \n Will many a savoury dish afford, \n And beats his compeers all \n With garlic seasoning richly drest; \n Then, too, the fatted ox \n Is sweet to eat both late at night, \n And at a noon-day feast. \n And I have quoted this piece of Ananius at length, thinking that it might\n give some suggestions to the present race of Epicures. \n ","16":"\n But Aristotle, in his treatise on the Habits of Animals, says\u2014 They say that\n wherever the anthias is found, there there is no beast or fish of prey ever\n seen; and accordingly the collectors of sponge use him as a guide, and dive\n boldly wherever he is found, and call him the sacred fish. And Dorion\n also mentions him in his book on Fishes, saying, Some call the anthias by\n the name of callicthys, and also by that of callionymus and ellops. And\n Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that he is called wolf by some\n authors, and by others callionymus: and that he is a fish of very solid meat, and\n full of delicious juice, and easy of digestion; but not very good for the stomach.\n But Aristotle says that the callicthys is a fish with serrated teeth, carnivorous\n and gregarious. And Epicharmus, in his Muses, enumerates the ellops among the\n fishes, but passes over the the callicthys or callionymus in silence as being\n identical with it; and of the ellops he speaks thus,\u2014 \n And then the high-priced ellops. \n \n And the same poet says, subsequently\u2014 \n He was the fish of which great Jupiter \n Once bought a pair for money, and enjoin'd \n His slaves to give him one, and Juno t'other. \n But Dorion, in his treatise on Fish, says that the anthias and the\n callicthys are different fish; and also that the callionymus is not the same as\n the ellops. \n ","17":"\n But what is the fish which is called the Sacred fish? The author of the Telchinian\n History, whether it was Epimenides the Cretan, or Teleclides, or any one else,\n says,\u2014 What are called the sacred fish, are dolphins and pompili. \n But the pompilus is a very amorous animal; as being sprung himself, at the same\n time with Venus, from heavenly blood. And Nicander, in the second book of his\n \u0152taica, says\u2014 \n The pompilus, who points the safest road \n To anxious mariners who burn with love, \n And without speaking warns them against danger. \n And Alexander the Aetolian, in his Crica, if indeed it is a genuine poem,\n says\u2014 \n Still did the pompilus direct the helm, \n Swimming behind, and guide it down the gulf, \n The minister of the gods, the sacred pompilus. \n And Pancrates the Arcadian, in his work entitled Works of the\n Sea, having first said\u2014 \n The pompilus, whom all sea-faring men \n Do call the sacred fish; \n proceeds to say, that the pompilus is not held in great esteem by\n Neptune only, but also by those gods who occupy Samothrace. At all events that\n some old fisherman once threatened to punish this fish, when the golden age\n still flourished among men; and his name was Epopeus, and he belonged to the\n island of Icarus. He therefore was one day fishing with his son, and they had\n no luck in their fishing, and caught nothing but pompili, and so did not\n abstain from eating them, but he and his son ate every one of them, and not\n long afterwards they suffered for their impiety; for a whale attacked the ship,\n and ate up Epopeus in the sight of his son. And Pancrates states, \"that\n the pompilus is an enemy to the dolphin; and even the dolphin does not escape with\n impunity when he has eaten a pompilus, for he becomes unable to exert himself and\n tremulous when he has eaten him; and so he gets cast on\n shore, and is eaten himself by the gulls and cormorants; and he is sometimes, when\n in this state, caught by men who give themselves up to hunting such large fish.\n And Timachides the Rhodian mentions the pom- pili in the ninth book of his\n Banquet, and says\u2014 \n The tench o' the sea, and then the pompili, \n The holiest of fish. \n And Erinna, or whoever it was who composed the poet which is attributed\n to her, says\u2014 \n O pompilus, thou fish who dost bestow \n A prosp'rous voyage on the hardy sailor, \n Conduct ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 ) my dear companion\n safely home. \n \n \n ","18":"\n And Apollonius the Rhodian or Naucratian, in his History of the foundation of\n Naucratis, says, \"Pompilus was originally a man; and he was changed into a fish,\n on account of some love affair of Apollo's. For the river Imbrasus flows by the\n city of the Samians,\u2014 \n And join'd to him, the fairest of the nymphs, \n The young and noble Chesias, bore a daughter, \n The lovely maid Ocyrhoe\u2014her whose beauty \n Was the kind Hours' heaven-descended gift. \n They say then that Apollo fell in love with her and endeavored to ravish\n her; and that she having crossed over to Miletus at the time of some festival of\n Diana, when the endeavour was about to be made to carry her off, being afraid of\n such an attempt being made, and being on her guard, entreated Pompilus, who was a\n seafaring man and a friend of her father, to conduct her safe back again to her\n own country, saying this,\u2014 \n O Pompilus, to whose wise breast are known \n The rapid depths of the hoarse roaring sea, \n Show that your mind doth recollect my sire, \n Who was your friend, and save his daughter now. \n And they say that he led her down to the shore, and conducted her safely\n across the sea: and that Apollo appeared and carried off the maiden, and sunk the\n ship with stones, and metamorphosed Pompilus into a fish of the same name, and\n that he made \n The Pompilus an everlasting slave \n Of ships that swiftly pass along the sea. \n \n \n ","19":"\n But Theocritus the Syracusan, in his poem entitled Berenice,\n calls the fish which is called leucus the sacred fish, speaking thus\u2014 \n And if a mortal seeks the gods with prayer \n For a successful hunt, or plenteous gold, \n A man who lives by the sea, whose nets he makes \n His ploughs to raise his crops; then let him come, \n And just at nightfall sacrifice with prayer \n To this same goddess the most sacred fish, \n Which men call leucus, (loveliest he of fish,) \n Then let him bend his nets; and soon he shall \n Draw them back from the waters full of prey. \n But Dionysius, who was surnamed the Iambic, in his treatise on Dialects,\n writes thus\u2014 We have heard accordingly an Eretrian fisherman, and many other\n fishermen, too, of other countries, call the pompilus the sacred fish. Now the\n pompilus is a sea fish, and is very commonly seen around ships, being something\n like the tunny called pelamys. However, some one spoken of by the poet catches\n this fish;\u2014 \n Sitting upon a high projecting rock \n He caught the sacred fish. \n Unless, indeed, there be any other kind which is likewise called the\n sacred fish. But Callimachus in his Galatea calls the chrysophrys the sacred\n fish, where he says\u2014 \n Or shall I rather say the gold-brow'd fish, \n That sacred fish, or perch, or all the rest \n Which swim beneath the vast unfathom'd sea. \n But in his Epigrams the same poet says\u2014 \n The sacred sacred hyca. \n But some understand by the term sacred fish, one let go and dedicated\n to the god, just as people give the same name to a consecrated ox. But others\n consider that sacred is here only equivalent to great, as Homer speaks of\n \n The sacred might of Alcinous. \n And some think that it is only called \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 as \u1f31\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1fe5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd \n (going down stream). \n \n ","20":"\n But Clitarchus, in the seventh book of his treatise on Dialects, says\u2014 The\n nautical people call the pompilus the sacred fish, because it conducts ships\n out of the open sea into harbour, on which account it is called \u03c0\u03cc\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 from \u03c0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c9, \n being the same fish as the chrysophrys. And Eratosthenes in his Mercury\n says\u2014 \n \n They left a share of all their booty there; \n Still living centipedes, the bearded mullet, \n The sea-thrush, with dark spots embroider'd o'er, \n Or the swift sacred fish with golden brows. \n Now after all this discussion of ours about fish, the excellent Ulpian\n may ask why Archestratus, speaking in those excellent suggestions of his of the\n cured fish on the Bosphoru, says\u2014 \n Those which do come from the Bosphoric seas \n Are whitest; only let there be no sample \n Of the hard meat o' the fish which grow around \n The Lake M\u00e6otis; not in verse can I \n That fish correctly name. \n What is the fish, which he says it is not proper to mention in\n poetry? \n ","21":"\n Anchovies must be next considered. And, indeed, Aristonymus uses the word in the\n singular number, in his Shivering Sun\u2014 So that there really is not one anchovy.\n But of the anchovies there are many kinds, and the one which is called\n aphritis is not produced from roe, as Aristotle says,\n but from a foam which floats upon the surface of the water, and which collects in\n quantities when there have been heavy rains. There is also another kind called\n cobitis, and that is produced from some little worthless gudgeons which are\n generated in the sand; and from this anchovy itself another kind is produced,\n which is called the encrasicholus. There is also another anchovy which is the\n offspring of the sprat; and another which comes from the membras; and another\n still which comes from the small cestris, which is engendered in the sand and\n slime. But of all these kinds the aphritis is the best. But Dorion, in his\n treatise on Fishes, speaks of a fish called the cobites, as good boiled, and also\n of the spawn of the atherina; and atherina is the name of a fish; and some also\n call the triglitis an anchovy. But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, enumerates\n the anchovies among the shrimps or membrades; making a distinction between this\n and what is called the seed. And Icesius says, Of the anchovy, there is one\n sort which is white and very thin and frothy, which some people also call the\n cobitis. And there is another which is not so clean as that, and which is\n larger; but the clean and thin one is the better of the\n two. And Archestratus the contriver of delicate dishes, says,\u2014 \n Use all anchovies for manure, except \n The Attic fish; I mean that useful seed \n Which the Ionians do call the foam; \n And take it fresh; just caught within the bays, \n The sacred bays of beautiful Phalerum. \n Good is it too, when by the sea-girt isle \n Of Rhodes you eat it, if it's not imported. \n And if you wish to taste it in perfection, \n Boil nettles with it\u2014nettles whose green leaves \n On both sides crown the stem; put these in the dish \n Around the fish, then fry them in one pan, \n And mix in fragrant herbs well steep'd in oil. \n \n \n ","22":"\n But Clearchus the Peripatetic, in his treatise on Proverbs, speaks of the anchovy,\n and says\u2014 Because they want very little fire for the frying-pan,\n Archestratus recommends people to put them into a pan which is already hot, and\n to take them off as soon as they hiss. And they are done, and begin to hiss in\n a moment, like oil; on which account it is said, 'Anchovy, look at the\n fire.' And Chrysippus the philosopher, in his treatise on the Things\n which deserve to be sought for their own Sakes, says, The anchovy which is\n found in the sea at Athens, men despise on account of its abundance, and say\n that it is a poor man's fish; but in other cities they prize it above\n everything, even where it is far inferior to the Attic anchovy. Moreover some\n people, says he, endeavour to rear the Adriatic fowls in this\n place, which are much less useful than our own kinds, inasmuch as they are\n smaller. But the people in the Adriatic, on the contrary, send for our breed\n from hence. Hermippus, too, uses the word \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03b7 in the singular number, in his Demot\u00e6, where he says,\u2014 \n You seem not now to move even an anchovy. \n And Calcias, in his Cyclops, says\u2014 \n In preference to the best anchovy. \n And Aristonymus, in his Shivering Sun, says\u2014 \n So that there is not really one anchovy. \n But Aristophanes uses the diminutive form, and calls them \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 in his Friers, saying\u2014 \n Nor these little Phaleric \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n \n \n ","23":"\n But Lynceus the Samian, in his letter to Diagoras, praising\n the Rhodian anchovies, and comparing many of the productions of Attica to those of\n Rhodes, says\u2014 We may compare to the anchovies of Phalerum those which are\n called the Aeniatides, and you may compare the ellops and the orphus with the\n glauciscus; and with the Eleusinian plaice and turbot, and whatever other fish\n there may be among them enjoying a reputation higher than that of Cecrops,\n Rhodes has the fox fish to compare. But the author of the Delight of\n Life, exhorts the man who is unable to purchase enough to satisfy his appetite, to\n get fish to eat by robbery, rather than go without it. But Lynceus calls\n Archestratus an epicure, who in that much celebrated poem of his speaks thus of\n the shark:\u2014 \n Are you at Rhodes? e'en if about to die, \n Still, if a man would sell you a fox shark, \n The fish the Syracusans call the dog, \n Seize on it eagerly; at least, if fat: \n And then compose yourself to meet your fate \n With brow serene and mind well satisfied. \n \n \n ","24":"\n The acharnus is mentioned by Callias in his Cyclops\u2014 \n A harp-fish roast, besides a ray, \n The head too of a tunny, \n And eel, some crabs, and this acharnus, \n The great Aenean dainty. \n \n \n ","25":"\n The ray, roach, or sea frog may also be mentioned. They are mentioned under the\n two former names by Aristotle in his treatise on Animals, where he classes them\n under the head of cartilaginous fish. And Eupolis, in his Flatterers, says\u2014 \n At Callias's house there is much pleasure, \n For he has crabs for dinner, rays besides, \n And hares, and women with light twinkling feet. \n And Epicharmus says, in his Marriage of Hebe\u2014 \n And there were rays and sea-frogs, sawfish, sharks, \n Camit\u00e6, roach, and lobsters with hard shells. \n And in his Megarian Woman he writes\u2014 \n Its sides were like a ray, \n Its back was altogether like a roach, \n Its head was long, far more like a stag's, \n Its flanks were like a scorpion's, son of the sea. \n And Sannyrion says, in his Laughter\u2014 \n O rays, O dainty grayling. \n And Aristotle in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that the following are cartilaginous fish; the\n ray, the turtle, the sea cow, the lamprey, the sea eagle, the sea frog, and the\n whole of the shark tribe. But Sophron in his Farces, gives one fish the name of\n botis, saying, The cestres eat the botis, though it is possible\n that he may be speaking of some herb. But with respect to the sea frog, the wise\n Archestratus gives us the following advice in his Apophthegms\u2014 \n Whenever you behold a frog, why roast him \n * * * * \n And . . . . prepare his stomach. \n And concerning the ray, he says\u2014 \n A boiled ray is good about midwinter. \n Eat it with cheese and assaf\u0153tida; \n But all the sons o' the sea whose flesh is lean \n Should, as a rule, be dress'd in such a fashion; \n And thus I recommend you now again. \n And Ephippus the comic poet, in his play called Philyra, (now Philyra is\n the name of a courtesan), says\u2014 \n \n A. Shall I first cut a ray in slender slices \n And boil it? aye? or like the cooks in Sicily \n Shall I prefer to roast it? \n \n B. Copy Sicily. \n \n \n ","26":"\n There are also fish called boaxes. Aristotle, in his treatise entitled Concerning\n Animals or Fish, says, The following animals are marked on the back; the\n boax and others\u2014the following are marked transversely, the kind of tunny fish\n called colias. And Epicharmus in his Marriage of Hebe, speaks thus\u2014\n \n And in addition to all these the boax, \n The smarides, anchovies, crabs and lobsters. \n And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, calls them boeces, saying\u2014 \n The white synodons, the boeces, and trinchi. \n But Speusippus and the rest of the Attic writers call them boaces.\n Aristophanes in his play called The Women who occupy Tents, says\u2014 \n But having had a bellyful of boaces, \n I turn'd my steps towards home. \n And they derived their name from the noise ( \u03b2\u03bf\u1f74 ) which they make, on which account it used to be said that the\n fish was sacred to Mercury, as the harp fish was to Apollo. But Pherecrates in his Ant-Men, saying\u2014 They say that there is no other fish\n whatever, which has any voice at all; ads afterwards,\u2014 By Castor\n and Pollux, there is at least no other fish except the boax. And\n Aristophanes the Byzantian says\u2014 That we are wrong to call the fish boax,\n when we ought to call it boops, since, though it is but a little fish, it as\n very large eyes, so that it might be called boops, having bulls' eyes. \n But we may reply to him, If we are wrong in naming him as we do, why do we say\n coracinus, not corocinus?

And Numenius says, in his Treatise on Fishing, \n Or a small sprat, or it may be a bembras, \n Kept in a well; you recollect these baits. \n And Dorion in his book on Fishes, says\u2014\"Having taken off the head of a\n bembras, if it be one of a tolerable size, and having washed it with water, and a\n small quantity of salt, then boil it in the same manner as you do a mullet; and\n the bembras is the only kind of anchovy from which is derived the condiment called\n bembraphya; which is mentioned by Aristonymus in the Sun Shivering\u2014 \n The carcinobates of Sicily \n Resembles the bembraphya. \n Still the Attic writers often call them bembrades. Aristomenes says in\n his Jugglers\u2014 \n Bringing some bembrades purchased for an obol. \n And Aristonymus in his Sun Shivering, says\u2014 \n The large anchovy plainly is not now, \n Nor e'en the bembras, quite unfortunate. \n \n And Aristophanes says in his Old Age\u2014 \n Fed on the hoary bembrades. \n And Plato in his Old Men, says\u2014 \n O Hercules, do just survey these bembrades. \n But in the Goats of Eupolis we may find the word written also with a\n \u03bc (not \u03b2\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u1f70\u03c2 \n but \u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u1f70\u03c2 ). And Antiphanes says, in his\n Cn\u0153sthis;\u2014 \n They do proclaim within the fishmarket \n The most absurd of proclamations, \n For just now one did shout with all his voice' \n That he had got some bembrades sweet as honey; \n But if this be the case, then what should hinder \n The honey-sellers crying out and saying, \n That they have honey stinking like a bembras? \n And Alexis in his Woman leading the Chorus, writes the word with a\n \u03bc \u2014 \n Who to the young folks making merry, then \n Put forth but lately pulse and membrades, \n And well-press'd grapes to eat. \n And in his Protochorus he says\u2014 \n No poorer meal, by Bacchus now I swear, \n Have I e'er tasted since I first became \n A parasite; I'd rather sup on membrades \n With any one who could speak Attic Greek; \n It would be better for me. \n \n \n ","28":"\n There is also a fish called the blennus, and it is mentioned by Sophron, in his\n play entitled The Fisherman and the Countryman, and he calls it the fat blennus.\n It is something like the tench in shape. But Epicharmus in his Hebe's Wedding\n speaks of a fish which he calls baiones, where he says\u2014 \n Come now and bring me high-backed mullets, \n And the ungrateful baiones. \n And among the Attic writers there is a proverb, No baion for me;\n he is a poor fish. \n \n ","29":"\n There is also a shell-fish called buglossus. And Archestratus, the Pythagorean,\n says, because of his temperate habits, \n Then we may take a turbot plump, or e'en \n A rough buglossus in the summer time, \n If one is near the famous Chalcis. \n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n There were buglossi and the harp-fish there. \n \n But the fish called cynoglossus differs from the buglossus.\n And of them too Epicharmus speaks\u2014 \n There were the variegated plotides, \n And cynoglossi, and sciathides. \n But the Attic writers call the buglossus the psetta. \n ","30":"\n There are also fish called congers. Icesius says that these are coarser than the\n common eels; and that their flesh is less firm and less nutritious, and that they\n are very deficient in palatable juice; but still, that they are good for the\n stomach. But Nicander, the epic poet, in the third book of his Treatise on\n Dialects, says that they are also called grylli. But Eudoxus, in the sixth book of\n his Circuit of the Earth, says that there are numbers of congers caught off\n Sicyon, each large enough to be a load for a man; and some of them even big enough\n to be a load for a cart. And Philemon, the comic poet, himself mentioning the\n extraordinary congers at Sicyon, represents a cook as priding himself on his\n skill, and saying in the play entitled the Soldier,\u2014 \n ","31":"\n \n \n How great a wish has now come over me \n To tell to heaven and earth the way in which \n I did prepare that supper. Aye, by Pallas, \n How sweet it is when everything goes right! \n How tender was my fish! and how I dress'd it! \n Not done with cheese, or powder'd o'er with dyes, \n But looking as he did in life, though roasted. \n So mild and gentle was the fire which I \n Did to the fish apply, you'd scarce believe it. \n It was as when a hen does seize some food, \n And carries it away to eat at leisure: \n She runs all round with care; another sees her, \n And straightway follows her to take it from her. \n So here, the man who first found out the pleasure \n Of dainty eating, sprang up high and ran \n All round and round, with his dish in his hand. \n The rest pursued him\u2014it was fine to see them: \n Some got a little, some got nothing, some \n Got all they wanted. Well, as I was saying, \n I took some river fish, eaters of mud. \n What if I'd had a scare, or blue-back'd fish \n From Attic waters, O thou saving Jupiter! \n Or boar from Argive woods, or noble conger \n From Sicyon's bay, the conger which the god \n Of the deep sea doth bear aloft to heaven, \n Fit banquet for his brethren. Then no doubt \n The guests who ate would all have seem'd like gods; \n I should have been immortal, since the dead \n By the mere smell of my meat I bring to life again. \n \n \n \n ","32":"\n I swear by Minerva that Menecrates the Syracusan himself would not have made such\n a boast as that, he who was nick-named Jupiter\u2014a man who gave himself airs as\n being, by his skill in medicine, the only person who could cause man to live.\n Accordingly he compelled all who came to be cured by him of what is called the\n sacred disease, to enter into a written agreement that if they recovered they\n would be his slaves. And they followed him, one wearing the dress of Hercules, and\n being called Hercules, (and the man who was so called was Nicostratus, an Argive,\n who had been cured of the sacred disease, and he is mentioned by Ephippus, in his\n Peltast, where he says\u2014 \n Did not Menecrates call himself a god, \n And Nicostratus of Argos a second Hercules?) \n and another followed him in the dress of Mercury, having on a cloak and\n bearing a caduceus, and wings besides. As Nicagoras of Zelia did, who also became\n afterwards the tyrant of his country, as Baton relates in the history of the\n Tyrants at Ephesus. And Hegesander says that he called Astycreon, who had been\n cured by him, Apollo. And another of those who had been cured by him, went about\n with him to his cost, wearing the dress of Aesculapius. But Jupiter Menecrates\n himself, clad in purple, and having a golden crown upon his head, and holding a\n sceptre, and being shod with slippers, went about with his chorus of gods. And\n once, writing to Philip the king, he began his letter thus\u2014 \n ","33":"\n \"Menecrates Jupiter to Philip greeting. \n \n You, indeed, are king of Macedonia, but I am king of medicine; and you are\n able, when you please, to put men to death, who are in health.; but I am able\n to save those who are sick, and to cause those who are in good health, if they\n only follow my advice, to live to old age without being attacked by disease.\n Therefore the Macedonians attend you as body-guards; but all who wish to live\n attend me; for I, Jupiter, give them life. \n \n And so Philip wrote back to him as to a man out of his senses,\u2014 Philip\n wishes Menecrates soundness. And he wrote in similar style to\n Archidemus, also the king of the Laced\u00e6monians, and to every one else to whom he\n wrote at all; never omitting to give himself the name of Jupiter. And once Philip\n invited him and all his gods to supper, and placed them all\n on the centre couch, which was adorned in the loftiest and most holy-looking and\n beautiful manner. And he had a table placed before them on which there was an\n altar and first-fruits of the different productions of the earth. And whenever\n eatables were placed before the other guests, the slaves placed incense before\n Menecrates, and poured libations in his honour. And at last, the new Jupiter, with\n all his subordinate gods, being laughed at by every one, ran away and fled from\n the banquet, as Hegesander relates. And Alexis also makes mention of Menecrates in\n his Minos. \n ","34":"\n And Themiso the Cyprian, the friend of Antiochus the king as Pythermus the\n Ephesian relates in the eighth book of his History, not only used to have his name\n proclaimed in the public assemblies, Themiso, the Macedonian, the Hercules\n of Antiochus the king; but all the people of that country used to\n sacrifice to him, addressing him as Hercules Themiso; and he himself would come\n when any of the nobles celebrated a sacrifice, and would sit down, having a couch\n to himself, and being clad in a lion's skin, and he used also to bear a Scythian\n bow, and in his hand he carried a club. Menecrates then himself, though he was\n such as we have said, never made such a preposterous boast as the cook we have\n been speaking of,\u2014 \n I am immortal, for I bring the dead, \n By the mere smell of my meat, to life again. \n \n \n ","35":"\n But the whole tribe of cooks are conceited and arrogant, as Hegesander says in his\n Brothers. For he introduces a cook, saying\u2014 \n \n A. My friend, a great deal has been said already \n By many men on the art of cookery, \n So either tell me something new yourself, \n Unknown to former cooks, or spare my ears. \n \n B. I'll not fatigue you; know that I alone \n Of present men have sounded all the depths \n Of culinary science and invention; \n For I have not been just a short two years \n Learning my art with snow-white apron girt, \n But all my life I have devoted anxiously \n To the investigation of each point \n Of moment; I have inquired into all \n The different kinds of herbs and vegetables; \n I know the habits of the bembrades, \n I know the lentils in their various sorts; \n In short, this I can say\u2014Whene'er I am \n \n At a funereal feast as minister, \n As soon as men come back from the funeral, \n Clad in dark garments, I take off the lids \n Of all my saucepans, and the weeping guests \n I clothe with smiling faces in a moment; \n And such a joy runs through each heart and frame \n As if they were a marriage feast attending. \n \n A. What! serving up lentils and bembrades? \n \n B. These are some accidental dishes only; \n But when I've got my necessary tools, \n And once have properly arranged my kitchen, \n That which in old time happen'd with the Sirens \n You shall again behold repeated now. \n For such shall be the savoury smell, that none \n Shall bring themselves to pass this narrow passage; \n And every one who passes by the door \n Shall stand agape, fix'd to the spot, and mute, \n Till some one of his friends, who's got a cold \n And lost his smell, drags him away by force. \n \n A. You're a great artist. \n \n B. Do not you then know \n To whom you speak? I do declare to you \n I have known many of the guests, who have, \n For my sake, eaten up their whole estates. \n Now, I beg you, tell me, in the name of all the gods at once, in what\n respect this man appears to you to differ from the Celedones in Pindar, who, in\n the same manner as the Sirens of old, caused those who listened to them to forget\n their food through delight, and so to waste away? \n ","36":"\n But Nicomachus, in his Ilithyia, himself also introduces a cook, who in arrogance\n and conceit goes far beyond the artists on the stage. This cook then speaks to the\n man who has hired him in this way,\u2014 \n \n A. You do display a gentlemanlike taste \n And kind; but one thing still you have omitted. \n \n B. How so? \n \n A. You never have inquired it seems \n How great a man I am. Or had you heard it \n From some one else who was acquainted with me, \n And so was that the reason you engaged me? \n \n B. By Jove I never heard or thought about it. \n \n A. Perhaps you do not know how great the\n difference \n Is that exists between one cook and another? \n \n B. Not I, but I shall know now, if you tell me. \n \n A. To take some meat that some one else has\n bought, \n And then to dress it tolerably, is \n What any cook can do. \n \n B. O Hercules! \n \n \n A. A perfect cook is quite another thing. \n For there are many admirable arts, \n All of which he must master thoroughly \n Who would excel in this. He first must have \n A smattering of painting; and indeed \n Many the sciences are which he must learn \n Before he's fit to begin learning cookery,\u2014 \n And you should know them ere you talk to me,\u2014 \n Astrology, and Medicine, and Geometry. \n For by these arts you'll know the qualities \n And excellences of the various fish. \n You'll learn to guide your dishes by the seasons; \n And when this fish is in, and this is out, \n For there is great variety in the pleasures \n That from the table spring. Sometimes, for instance, \n A boax will be better than a tunny. \n \n B. Perhaps; but what on earth has that to do \n With your geometry \n \n A. Why this. We say \n The kitchen is a sphere; this we divide, \n And take one portion, as may suit our art, \n Borrowing the principles of mensuration. \n \n B. I understand; that's quite enough of that. \n Where does your medical skill display itself? \n \n A. Know there are meats hard, indigestible, \n Pregnant with flatulence, causing only torture \n To the unhappy eater, and no nourishment. \n Yet those who sup at other folks' expense \n Are always greedy and not temperate. \n For these and similar viands, remedies \n Must come from the resources of our art; \n And how to marshal everything in order \n With wisdom and propriety, we learn \n By borrowing from the science of the General. \n To count the guests requires arithmetic. \n And no one else has all these parts of knowledge \n Except myself. \n \n B. Now in your turn, awhile \n Listen to me. \n \n A. Say on. \n \n B. Give no more trouble \n To me nor to yourself: but just keep quiet, \n And rest yourself all day for all I care. \n \n \n ","37":"\n And the cook in the Younger Philemon wishes to be a sort of tutor, and speaks in\n this fashion\u2014 \n There, let things be as they are.

Nor too fierce. \n (For that again does burn whate'er it catches, \n \n And yet is far from cooking the meat through.) \n It is not every one who has a spoon \n And knife about him that we call a cook, \n Nor every one who puts his fish in a pan; \n There is more wit and reason in the business. \n \n \n ","38":"\n And the cook in Diphilus's Painter tells us also to whom he thinks it worth his\n while to hire himself, saying\u2014 \n \n A.

Meantime the fragrant herbs \n And pleasant sharpness of the seasonings \n Delight my master. Quickly I serve up \n Some fish exactly boiled; retaining all \n His juice, and all his unextracted flavour; \n A dish which any free-born man must know \n How to appreciate rightly. In this manner \n At the expense of one small pot of oil \n I gain employment at full fifty banquets. \n And Philostephanus, in his Delian, gives a catalogue of the names of some\n celebrated cooks in these lines, and those which follow them\u2014 \n In my opinion you, O D\u00e6dalus, \n Surpass all cooks in skill and genius, \n Save the Athenian Thimbron, call'd the Top. \n So here I've come to beg your services, \n Bringing the wages which I know you ask. \n \n \n ","40":"\n And Sotades, not the Maronite poet, who composed Ionian songs, but the poet of the\n middle comedy, in the play entitled The Shut-up Women, (for that was the name\n which he gave to it,) introduces a cook making the following speech,\u2014 \n First I did take some squills, and fried them all; \n Then a large shark I cut in slices large, \n Roasting the middle parts, and the remainder \n I boil'd and stuff'd with half-ripe mulberries. \n Then I take two large heads of dainty grayling, \n And in a large dish place them, adding simply \n Herbs, cummin, salt, some water, and some oil. \n Then after this I bought a splendid pike, \n To boil in pickle with all sorts of herbs. \n Avoiding all such roasts as want a spit, \n \n I bought too some fine mullet, and young thrushes, \n And put them on the coals just as they were, \n Adding a little brine and marjoram. \n To these I added cuttle-fish and squills. \n A fine dish is the squill when carefully cook'd. \n But the rich cuttle-fish is eaten plain, \n Though I did stuff them all with a rich forced meat \n Of almost every kind of herb and flower. \n Then there were several dishes of boil'd meats, \n And sauce-boats full of oil and vinegar. \n Besides all this a conger fine and fat \n I bought, and buried in a fragrant pickle; \n Likewise some tench, and clinging to the rocks \n Some limpets. All their heads I tore away, \n And cover'd them with flour and bread crumbs over, \n And then prepared them as I dress'd the squills. \n There was a widow'd amia too, a noble \n And dainty fish. That did I wrap in fig-leaves, \n And soak'd it through with oil, and over all \n With swaddling clothes of marjoram did I fold it, \n And hid it like a torch beneath the ashes. \n With it I took anchovies from Phalerum, \n And pour'd on them one cruet full of water. \n Then shredding herbs quite fine, I add more oil, \n More than two cotylee in quantity. \n What next? That's all. This sir is what I do, \n Not learning from recipes or books of cookery. \n \n \n ","41":"\n However, this is enough about cooks. But we must say something about the conger.\n For Archestratus, in his Gastronomy, tells us how every part of it should be\n treated, saying\u2014 \n In Sicyon my friend you best can get \n A mighty head of conger, fat, and strong, \n And large; and also take his entrails whole, \n Then boil him a long time, well-soak'd in brine. \n And after this he goes through the whole country of Italy, saying where\n the congers are best, describing them like a regular writer of an Itinerary, and\n he says\u2014 \n There too fine congers may be caught, and they \n Are to all other fish as far superior \n As a fat tunny is to coracini. \n And Alexis, in his Seven against Thebes, says\u2014 \n And all the parts of a fine conger eel \n Well hash'd together, overlaid with fat. \n \n \n And Archedicus, in his Treasure, introduces a cook speaking of some fish which he\n has been buying in the following terms\u2014 \n \n Then for three drachmas I agrayling bought. \n Five more I gave for a large conger's head \n And shoulders. (Oh, how hard a thing is life!) \n Another drachma for the neck.

They will devour me. \n What I now say is what concerns myself. \n And then, such wine they spit out on the ground! \n Alas! Alas! \n \n \n ","42":"\n There is a kind of shark called \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2, which is\n eaten. And Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that the best and tenderest\n kind of galei are those called asteri\u00e6. But Aristotle says that there are many\n kinds of them\u2014the thorny, the smooth, the spotted, the young galeus, the fox\n shark, and the file shark. But Dorion, in his Book on Fishes, says that the fox\n shark has only one fin towards his tail, but has none along the ridge of his back.\n But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that the centrines\n is also a kind of shark, and also the notidanus. But Ep\u00e6netus, in his Cookery\n Book, calls the latter the enotideus, and says that the centrines is very\n inferior to him, and that it has a bad smell; and that the one may be\n distinguished from the other by the fact of the centrines having a sort of spur\n on his first fin, while the rest of the kinds have not got such a\n thing. \n And he says that these fishes have no fat or suet in them, because they are\n cartilaginous. \n \n And the acanthias, or thorny shark, has this peculiarity, that his heart is\n five-cornered. And the galeus has three young at most; and it receives its young\n into his mouth, and immediately ejects them again; and the variegated galeus is\n especially fond of doing this, and so is the fox shark. But the other kinds do not\n do so, because of the roughness of the skins of the young ones. \n ","43":"\n But Archestratus, the man who lived the life of Sardanapalus, speaking of the\n galeus as he is found at Rhodes, says that it is the same fish as that which,\n among the Romans, is brought on the table to the music of flutes, and accompanied\n with crowns, the slaves also who carry it being crowned, and\n that it is called by the Romans accipesius. But the accipesius, the same as the\n acipenser, or sturgeon, is but a small fish in comparison, and has a longer nose,\n and is more triangular than the galeus in his shape. And the very smallest and\n cheapest galeus is not sold at a lower price than a thousand Attic drachm\u00e6. But Appian, the grammarian, in his essay on the Luxury of Apicius, says\n that the accipesius is the fish called the ellops by the Greeks. But Archestratus,\n speaking of the Rhodian galeus, counselling his companions in a fatherly sort of\n way, says\u2014 \n Are you at Rhodese'en if about to die, \n Still, if a man would sell you a fox shark, \n The fish the Syracusans call the dog, \n Seize on it eagerly; at least, if fat: \n And then compose yourself to meet your fate \n With brow serene and mind well satisfied. \n Lynceus, the Samian, also quotes these verses in his letter to Diagoras,\n and says that the poet is quite right in advising the man who cannot afford the\n price for one, to gratify his appetite by robbery rather than go without it. For\n he says that Theseus; who I take to have been some very good-looking man, offered\n to indulge Thepolemus in anything if he would only give him one of these fish. And\n Timocles, in his play called The Ring, says\u2014 \n Galei and rays, and all the fish besides \n Which cooks do dress with sauce and vinegar. \n \n \n ","44":"\n There is also the sea-grayling. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n There is the variegated scorpion, \n The lizard, and the fat sea-grayling too. \n And Numenius, in his Treatise on Fishing, says\u2014 \n The hycca, the callicthys, and the chromis, \n The orphus, the sea-grayling too, who haunts \n The places where seaweed and moss abound. \n And Archestratus, praising the head of the glaucus, says\u2014 \n If you're at Megara or at Olynthus, \n Dress me a grayling's head. For in the shallows \n Around those towns he's taken in perfection. \n And Antiphanes, in his Shepherd, says\u2014 \n B\u0153otian eels, and mussels too from Pontus, \n Graylings from Megara, from Carystus shrimps, \n Eretrian phagri, and the Scyrian crabs. \n \n And the same writer, in his Philotis, speaks thus\u2014 \n \n A.

And they say that one foretells \n To mortals all the evils which hang o'er them. \n \n B. You mean the grayling. \n \n A. You are right, I do. \n And Theolytus, the Methymn\u00e6an, in his Bacchic Odes, says that Glaucus the\n deity of the sea became enamoured of Ariadne, when she was carried off by Bacchus\n in the island of Dia; and that he, attempting to offer violence to her, was bound\n by Bacchus in fetters made of vine-twigs; but that when he begged for mercy he was\n released, saying\u2014 \n There is a place, Anthedon is its name, \n On the seaside, against th' Eub\u0153an isle, \n Near to the stream of the still vext Euripus\u2014 \n Thence is my race; and Copeus was my sire. \n And Promathides of Heraclea, in his Half Iambics, traces the pedigree of\n Glaucus as being the son of Polybus, the son of Mercury, and of Eub\u0153a, the\n daughter of Larymnus. But Mnaseas, in the third book of his history of the Affairs\n of Europe, calls him the son of Anthedon and Alcyone; and says that he was a\n sailor and an excellent diver, and that he was surnamed Pontius; and that having\n ravished Syme, the daughter of Ialemus and Dotis, he sailed away to Asia, and\n colonised a desert island near Caria, and called that Syme, from the name of his\n wife. But Euanthes, the epic poet, in his Hymn to Glaucus, says that he was the\n son of Neptune and the nymph Nais; and that he was in love with Ariadne, in the\n island of Dia, and was favoured by her after she had been left there by Theseus.\n But Aristotle, in his Constitution of the Delians, says that he settled in Delos\n with the Nereids, and gave oracles to all who wished for them. But Possis, the\n Magnesian, in the third book of his Amazonis, says that Glaucus was the builder of\n the Argo, and that he was her pilot when Jason fought the\n Etrurians, and was the only person unwounded in that naval battle; and that by he\n will of Jupiter he appeared in the depths of the sea, and so became a sea deity,\n but was seen by Jason alone. But Nicanor the Cyren\u00e6an, in his Changes of Names,\n says that Melicerta changed his name and assumed the name of Glaucus. \n ","47":"\n Alexander the Aetolian also mentions him in his poem entitled the Fisherman,\n saying that he \n First tasted grass, \n (and then was immersed in the sea and drowned,) \n The herb which in the islands of the blest, \n When first the spring doth beam upon the earth, \n The untill'd land shows to the genial sun. \n And the sun gives it to his weary steeds, \n A most refreshing food, raised in the shade. \n So that they come in vigour back renew'd \n Unto their daily task, and no fatigue \n Or pain can stop their course. \n But Aeschrion the Samian, in some one of his Iambic poems, says that\n Glaucus the sea-deity was in love with Hydna, the daughter of Scyllus, the diver\n of Scione. And he makes particular mention of this herb, namely, that any one who\n eats of it becomes immortal, saying\u2014 \n And you found too th' agrostis of the gods, \n The sacred plant which ancient Saturn sow'd. \n And Nicander, in the third book of his Europe, says that Glaucus was\n beloved by Nereus. And the same Nicander, in the first book of his history of the\n Affairs of Aetolia, says that Apollo learnt the art of divination from Glaucus;\n and that Glaucus when he was hunting near Orea, (and that is a lofty mountain in\n Aetolia,) hunted a hare, which was knocked up by the length of the chance, and got\n under a certain fountain, and when just on the point of dying, rolled itself on\n the herbage that was growing around; and, as it recovered its strength by means of\n the herbage, Glaucus too perceived the virtues of this herb, and ate some himself.\n And becoming a god in consequence, when a storm came, he, in accordance with the\n will of Jupiter, threw himself into the sea. But Hedylus, whether he was a Samian\n or an Athenian I know not, says that Glaucus was enamoured of Melicert, and threw\n himself into the sea after him. But Hedyl, the mother of this poet, and daughter\n of Moschine of Atica, a poetess who composed Iambics, in her\n poem which is entitled Scylla, relates that Glaucus being in love with Scylla came\n to her cave\u2014 \n Bearing a gift of love, a mazy shell, \n Fresh from the Erythrean rock, and with it too \n The offspring, yet unfledged, of Alcyon, \n To win th' obdurate maid. He gave in vain. \n Even the lone Siren on the neighbouring isle \n Pitied the lover's tears. For as it chanced, \n He swam towards the shore which she did haunt, \n Nigh to th' unquiet caves of Aetna. \n \n \n ","48":"\n There is also a fish called the fuller. Dorion, in his treatise on Fish, says that\n the juice which proceeds from the boiling of a fuller will take out every kind of\n stain; and Ep\u00e6netus also mentions it in his Cookery Book. \n ","49":"\n The eel is well known: and Epicharmus mentions sea-eels in his Muses; but Dorion,\n in his treatise on Fishes, mentioning those which come from the lake Copais,\n extols the Copaic eels highly; and they grow to a great size. At all events,\n Agatharchides, in the sixth book of his history of the Affairs of Europe, says\n that the largest eels from lake Copais are sacrificed to the gods by the B\u0153otians,\n who crown them like victims, and offer prayers over them, sprinkling them with\n meal; and that once, when a foreigner was astonished at the singular kind of\n victim and sacrifice, and asked a B\u0153otian whence it originated, the B\u0153otian\n answered, That he only knew one thing; that it was right to maintain the customs\n of one's ancestors, and that it was not right to make any excuses for them to\n foreigners. But we need not wonder if eels are sacrificed as victims, since\n Antigonus the Carystian, in his treatise on Language, says that the fishermen\n celebrate a festival in honour of Neptune when the tunnies come in season, and\n they are successful in their pursuit of them; and that they sacrifice to the god\n the first tunny that is caught; and that this sacrificial festival is called the\n Thunn\u00e6um. \n ","50":"\n But among the people of Phaselis, even salt-fish are offered in sacrifice. At all\n events, Heropythus, in his Annals of the Colophonians, speaking of the original\n settlement of Phaselis, says that Lacius, having conducted the colony, gave\n as the price of the ground to Cylabras, a shepherd who fed sheep there, some\n salt-fish, as that was what he asked for. For when Lacius had proposed to him\n to take as a price for the soil either barley-cakes, or\n wheat-cakes, or salt-fish, Cyla- bras chose the salt-fish. And, on this\n account, the people of Phaselis every year, even to this day, sacrifice\n salt-fish to Cylabras. But Philostephanus, in the first book of his\n treatise on the Cities of Asia, writes thus:\u2014 That Lacius the Argive, being\n one of the men who had come with Mopsus, whom some say was a Lindian, and the\n brother of Antiphemus who colonized Gela, was sent to Phaselis by Mopsus with\n some men, in accordance with some directions given by Manto the mother of\n Mopsus, when the sterns of their ships came in collision off the Chelidoni\u00e6,\n and were much broken, as Lacius and the vessels with him ran into them in the\n night, in consequence of their arriving later. And it is said that he purchased\n the land where the city now stands, in obedience to the prophetic directions of\n Manto, from a man of the name of Cylabras, giving him some salt-fish for it;\n for that was what he had selected from all the ships contained. On which\n account, the people of Phaselis sacrifice salt-fish to Cylabras every year,\n honouring him as their hero. \n \n ","51":"\n But concerning eels, Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that eels have a\n better juice in them than any other fish; and in the quality of being good for the\n stomach, they are superior to most, for they are very satisfying and very\n nutritious: though he classes the Macedonian eels among the salt-fish. But\n Aristotle says that eels are fond of the very purest water; on which account, the\n people who feed eels pour clean water over them; for they get choked in muddy\n water. For which reason, those who hunt for them make the water muddy, in order\n that the eels may be choked; for, having very small gills, their pores are almost\n immediately stopped up by any mud or disturbance in the water: on which account,\n also, they are often choked during storms, when the water is disturbed by heavy\n gales. But they propagate their species being entwined together, and then they\n discharge a sort of viscous fluid from their bodies, which lies in the mud and\n generates living creatures. And the people who feed eels say that they feed by\n night, but that during the day they remain motionless in the mud; and they live\n about eight years at most. But in other places, Aristotle ells us again, that they\n are produced without either their progenitors laying eggs or bringing forth living\n offspring, and also that they are not generated by any\n copulation, but that they are propagated by the putrefaction which takes place in\n the mud and slime\u2014as it is said of those things which are called the entrails of\n the earth. From which circumstance, he says that Homer distinguishes between their\n nature and that of other fish; and says\u2014 \n The eels and fish within the briny deep, \n Were startled at the blaze. \n \n \n ","52":"\n But a certain Epicurean, who was one of our party, when an eel was served up, said,\u2014Here is the\n Helen of the feast; I therefore will be the Paris! And, before any one else could\n stretch out a hand towards it, he seized hold of it and split it up, tearing off\n one side down to the backbone. And the same man, when presently a hot cheese-cake\n was set before him, and when all refused it, cried out, \n I will attack it were it hot as fire; \n and then, rushing upon it eagerly, and swallowing it, he was carried out\n severely scalded. And Cynulcus said,\u2014The cormorant is carried out from his battle\n of the throat! \n Moreover, Archestratus thus speaks of the eel:\u2014 \n I praise all kinds of eels; but far the best \n Is that which fishermen do take in the sea \n Opposite to the strait of Rhegium. \n Where you, Messenius, who daily put \n This food within your mouth, surpass all mortals \n In real pleasure. Though none can deny \n That great the virtue and the glory is \n Of the Strymonian and Copaic eels. \n For they are large, and wonderfully fat; \n And I do think in short that of all fish \n The best in flavour is the noble eel, \n Although he cannot propagate his species. \n \n \n ","53":"\n But, as Homer has said, \n The eels and fish were startled, \n Archilochus has also said, in a manner not inconsistent with that\u2014 \n And you received full many sightless eels. \n But the Athenians, as Tryphon says, form all the cases in the singular\n number with the \u03c5, but do not make the cases in\n the plural in a similar manner. Accordingly, Aristophanes, in\n his Acharnensians, says\u2014 \n Behold, O boys, the noble eel ( \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd ); \n and, in his Lemnian Women, he says\u2014 \n \n \u1fce\u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd \u03b2\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03bd : \n but he uses the nominative case in his Daitaleis\u2014 \n And smooth too \u1f65\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2. \n \n And Cratinus, in his Pluti, says\u2014 \n The tunny, orphus, grayling, eel, and sea-dog. \n But the Attic writers do not form the cases in the plural number as Homer\n does. Aristophanes says, in his Knights- For you have fared like men who're\n hunting eels ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ); and, in his second\n edition of the Clouds, he says\u2014 \n Imitating my images of the eels ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd ); \n and in his Wasps we find the dative case\u2014 \n I don't delight in rays nor in \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \n \n And Strattis, in his Potamii, said\u2014 \n A cousin of the eels ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd ). \n Simonides, too, in his Iambics, writes\u2014 \n Like an eel ( \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 ) complaining of being\n slippery. \n He also uses it in the accusative\u2014 \n A kite was eating a M\u00e6andrian eel ( \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd ), \n But a heron saw him and deprived him of it. \n But Aristotle, in his treatise on Animals, writes the word with an\n \u03b9, \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2. But when Aristophanes, in his\n Knights, says\u2014 \n Your fate resembles that of those who hunt \n For mud-fed eels. For when the lake is still \n Their labour is in vain. But if they stir \n The mud all up and down, they catch much fish. \n And so you gain by stirring up the city; \n he shows plainly enough that the eel is caught in the mud, ( \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f34\u03bb\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2, ) and it is from this word \u1f34\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 that the name \u1f14\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 ends in \u03c5\u03c2. The Poet,\n therefore, wishing to show that the violent effect of the fire reached even to the\n bottom of the river, spoke thus-The eels and fish were troubled; speaking of the\n eels separately and specially, in order to show the very great depth to which the\n water was influenced by the fire. \n ","54":"\n But Antiphanes, in his Lycon, jesting on the Egyptians after the manner of the\n comic poets, says\u2014 \n \n They say in other things the Egyptian race \n Is clever also, since they think the eel \n On a level with the gods; or I may say \n By far more valuable. For, as to the gods,\u2014 \n Those we gain over by our prayers alone; \n But as for eels, without you spend at least \n Twelve drachmas you can scarce get leave to smell them. \n So it is altogether a holy beast. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Cities, directing what he says to the Egyptians,\n speaks as follows\u2014 \n I never could myself your comrade be, \n For neither do'our manners nor our laws \n Agree with yours, but they are wholly different. \n You do adore an ox; I sacrifice him \n To the great Gods of heaven. You do think \n An eel the mightiest of deities; \n But we do eat him as the best of fish. \n You eat no pork; I like it above all things. \n You do adore a dog; but I do beat him \n If e'er I catch him stealing any meat. \n Then our laws enjoin the priests to be \n Most perfect men; but yours are mutilated. \n If you do see a cat in any grief \n You weep; but I first kill him and then skin him. \n You have a great opinion of the shrew-mouse; \n But I have none at all. \n And Timocles, in his Egyptians, says\u2014 \n How can an ibis or a dog be able \n To save a man? For where with impious hearts \n Men sin against the all-acknowledged Gods, \n And yet escape unpunish'd, who can think \n The altar of a cat will be more holy, \n Or prompter to avenge itself, than they? \n \n \n ","55":"\n But that men used to wrap eels up in beet, and then eat them, is a fact constantly\n alluded to in the poets of the old comedy; and Eubulus says in his Echo\u2014 \n The nymph who never knew the joys of marriage, \n Clothed with rosy beet will now appear, \n The white-flesh'd eel. Hail, brilliant luminary, \n Great in my taste, and in your own good qualities. \n And in his Ionian he says\u2014 \n And after this were served up the rich \n Entrails of roasted tunnies; then there came \n Those natives of the lake, the holy eels, \n B\u0153otian goddesses; all clothed in beet. \n And in his Medea he says\u2014 \n \n The sweet B\u0153otian Copaic virgin; \n For I do fear to name the Goddess. \n And that the eels of the river Strymon were also celebrated, Antiphanes\n tells us in his Thamyras, saying\u2014 \n And then your namesake river, far renown'd \n In all the mouths of men, the mighty Strymon, \n Who waters the rich warlike plains of Thrace, \n Breeds mighty eels. \n And Demetrius the Scepsian, in the sixteenth book of his Trojan Array,\n says that there were eels of surpassing excellence produced in the neighbourhood\n of the river Euleus (and this river is mentioned by Antimachus in his work\n entitled The Tablets, where he says\u2014 \n Arriving at the springs \n Where Euleus with his rapid eddies rises). \n \n \n ","56":"\n With respect to the ellops, some mention has already been made of him. But\n Archestratus also speaks in this way of him\u2014 \n The best of ellopes which you can eat \n Come from the bay of famous Syracuse. \n Those eat whene'er you can. For that's the place \n Whence this great fish originally came. \n But those which are around the islands caught, \n Or any other land, or nigh to Crete, \n Too long have battled with the eddying currents, \n And so are thin and harder to the taste. \n \n \n ","57":"\n The erythrinus, or red mullet, has been mentioned too. Aristotle, in his book on\n Animals, and Speusippus both say that the fishes called erythrinus, phagrus, and\n hepatus are all very nearly alike. And Dorion has said much the same in his\n treatise on Fish. But the Cyren\u00e6ans give the name of erythrinus to the hyca; as\n Clitarchus tells us in his Dialects. \n ","58":"\n The encrasicholi are also mentioned by Aristotle as fish of small size, in his\n treatise on What relates to Animals. But Dorion, in his book on Fishes, speaks of\n the encrasicholi among those which are best boiled, speaking in the following\n terms\u2014 One ought to boil the encrasicholi, and the iopes, and the\n atherin\u00e6, and the tench, and the smaller mullet, and the cuttle-fish, and the\n squid, and the different kinds of crab or craw-fish. \n \n ","59":"\n The hepsetus, or boiled fish, is a name given to several small fish. Aristophanes,\n in his Anagyrus, says\u2014 \n There is not one dish of hepseti. \n \n And Archippus says in his Fishes\u2014 \n An hepsetus fell in with an anchovy \n And quick devour'd him. \n And Eupolis, in his Goats, says\u2014 \n Ye graces who do love the hepseti. \n And Eubulus, in his Prosusia or Cycnus, says\u2014 \n Contented if just once in each twelve days \n He sees an hepsetus well boil'd in beet. \n And Alexis, in his Apeglaucomenos, says\u2014 \n There were some hepseti besides served up \n In a d\u00e6dalean manner. For they call \n All clever works by the name of D\u00e6dalus; \n and presently afterwards he continues\u2014 \n Will you not now then try the coracini? \n Nor trichides, nor any hepseti? \n But this word is always used in the plural, \u1f11\u03c8\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76, because they are only served up in numbers. Aristophanes, in\n his Dramata or Niobus, says\u2014 \n I will say nothing of a dish of hepseti. \n And Menander, in his Perinthian Woman, says\u2014 \n The boy came in bringing some hepseti. \n But Nicostratus uses the word in the singular number, in his Hesiod\u2014\n \n A bembras, an anchovy, and a hepsetus. \n And Posidippus, in his Woman shut up, says\u2014 \n She's gone to buy a hepsetus. \n But in my country Naucratis, what they call hepseti are little fish left\n in the drains or ditches, when the Nile ceases its overflowing. \n ","60":"\n The hepatus or lebias is the next fish to be noticed. Diodes affirms that this is\n one of those fish which stick to the rocks; but Speusippus says that the hepatus\n is the same as the phagrus. But it is a solitary fish, as Aristotle declares,\n carnivorous, and with serrated teeth; black as to its flesh, and having eyes\n large, out of all proportion to the rest of its size; and its heart is triangular\n and white. But Archestratus, the marshal of banquets, says\u2014 \n Remember that the lebias is best, \n As also is the hepatus, in the waves \n Which wash the Delian and the Tenian shores. \n \n \n \n ","61":"\n Then come the elacatenes, or spindle fish. Mnesima- chus, in his Horsebreeder,\n classes together in one line\u2014 \n The turbot, tunny, tench, elacatene. \n But they are a cetaceous fish, very good for curing in his Colons, says\u2014\n \n The tench, th' elacatene, and the tail-fin of \n The sea-dog are the best for pickling. \n And Mnaseas of Patra says, \"Of Ichthys and Hesychia, his sister, were\n born the galene, the lamprey, and the elacatene. \n ","62":"\n The tunny must also not be forgotten. Aristotle says this fish swims into the\n Black Sea, always keeping the land on the right; but that he sails out again,\n keeping the land on the left. For that he can see much best with his right eye,\n but that he is rather blind with his left eye. And under his fins he has a sort of\n gadfly; he delights in heat, on which account he comes wherever there is sand; and\n he is most eatable at the season when he gets rid of that fly. But he propagates\n his species after his time of torpor is over, as we are told by Theophrastus; and\n as long as his offspring are little, he is very difficult to catch, but when they\n get larger, then he is easily caught, because of the gadfly. But the tunny lies in\n holes, although he is a fish with a great deal of blood. And Archestratus says\u2014\n \n Around the sacred and the spacious isle \n Of Samos you may see large tunnies caught. \n The Samians call them horcyes, and others \n Do name them cetus. These 'tis well to buy, \n Fit offering for the Gods; and do it quickly, \n Nor stop to haggle or bargain for the price. \n Good too are those which fair Byzantium, \n Or the Carystian marble rocks do breed. \n And in the famous isle of Sicily, \n The Cephalcedian and Tyndarian shores \n Send forth fish richer still. And if you come \n To sacred Italy, where Hipponium's cape \n Frowns on the waves which lave the Bruttian coast \n Those are the best of all. The tunnies there \n Have gain'd the height of fame and palm of victory. \n Still those which there you find have wander'd far, \n Cross'd many seas, and many a roaring strait, \n So that we often catch them out of season. \n \n \n ","63":"\n But this fish was called the tunny ( \u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) from\n rushing ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ), and moving rapidly. For\n it s an impetuous fish, from, at a particular season, having a gadfly in its head; by which Aristotle says that it is driven about, writing\n thus\u2014 But the tunny fish and the sword fish are driven to frenzy about\n the time of the rising of the dogstar; for both of them at that season have\n under their fins something like a small worm, which is called oestrus,\n resembling a scorpion, and in size something similar to a spider, and this\n makes them leap about in leaps as. large as those of the dolphin. And\n Theodoridas says,\u2014 \n The tunnies bend their furious course to Gades. \n But Polybius of Megalopolis, in the thirty-fourth book of his History,\n speaking of the Lusitanian district in Iberia, says, That in the sea, in\n these parts, acorn-bearing oaks grow, on the fruit of which the tunnies feed,\n and grow fat; so that a person who called the tunny the pig of the sea would\n not err, for the tunnies, like the pigs, grow to a great size on these\n acorns. \n \n ","64":"\n And the intestines of this fish are highly extolled, as Eubulus also tells us, in\n his Ionian,\u2014 \n And after this the luscious intestines \n Of roasted tunnies sail'd upon the table. \n And Aristophanes, in his Lemnian Woman, says\u2014 \n Despise not thou the fat B\u0153otian eel, \n Nor grayling, nor the entrails of the tunny. \n And Strattis, in his Atalanta, says\u2014 \n Next buy the entrails of a tunny, and \n Some pettitoes of pigs, to cost a drachma. \n And the same poet says in his Macedonians\u2014 \n And the sweet entrails of the tunny fish. \n And Eriphus says in his Melib\u0153a\u2014 \n These things poor men cannot afford to buy, \n The entrails of the tunny or the head \n Of greedy pike, or conger, or cuttle-fish, \n Which I don't think the gods above despise. \n But when Theopompus, in his Call\u00e6schrus, says, \n The \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd of fish, O Ceres, \n we must take notice that the writers of his time apply the term \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd to fish, but very seldom to pigs or other\n animals; but it is uncertain what animals Antiphanes is speaking of, when he makes\n use of the term \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd in his Ponticus, where\n he says\u2014 \n \n Whoever has by chance bought dainty food \n For these accursed and abandon'd women, \n Such as \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, which may Neptune \n Confound for ever; and who seeks to place \n Beside them now a dainty loin of meat . . . \n And Alexis, in his Ulysses weaving, praises the head of the tunny; and\n says\u2014 \n \n A. And I will throw the fishers headlong down \n Into the pit. They only catch for me \n Food fit for freed men; trichides and squids, \n And partly fried fish. \n \n B. But not long ago, \n This man, if he could get a tunny's head, \n Thought he was eating tunnies whole, and eels. \n They praised also that part of the tunny which they called the\n key, as Aristophon does, in his Peirithus:\u2014 \n \n A. But now the dinner is all spoilt entirely. \n \n B. Here are two roasted keys quite fit to eat. \n \n A. What, keys to open doors? \n \n B. No, tunny keys; \n A dainty dish. \n \n A. There is the Spartan key too. \n \n \n ","65":"\n But Antigonus the Carystian, in his treatise on Language, says that the tunny is\n sacrificed to Neptune, as we have already mentioned. But Heracleon the Ephesian\n says that the Attic writers call the tunny the orcynus. And Sostratus, in the\n second book of his treatise on Animals, says that the pelamys is called the\n thunnis, or female tunny-fish; but that when it becomes larger, it is called\n thunnus; and when it gets to a larger size still, it is called the orcynus; and\n that when it has grown to a size which is quite enormous, then it is called cetus.\n And Aeschylus likewise mentions the tunny, saying\u2014 \n I bid you take up hammers now, and beat \n The fiery mass of iron, which will utter \n No groan, but bear in silence like the tunny. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Turning his eye aside, just like the tunny; \n because the tunny cannot see well out of his left eye, as Aristotle has\n said. Menander, in his Fishermen, says\u2014 \n And the disturbed and muddy sea which breeds \n The largest tunnies. \n And in Sophron we find the word \u03b8\u03c5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (a hunter of tunnies); but the same\n fish which is usually called \u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, the Attic\n writers call \u03b8\u03c5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c2. \n \n ","66":"\n But as to the thunnis, Aristotle says that this is the female, differing from the\n male thunnus in having a fin under the belly, the name of which fin is the\n ather. But in his treatise on the Parts of Animals, he again\n distinguishes the thunnis from the thunnus; saying, that in the summer,\n about the month Hecatomb\u00e6on, it drops something like a bag, in which there are\n a great number of small eggs. And Speusippus, in the second book of his\n Similitudes, distin- guishes the thunnis from the thunnus; and so does Epichar-\n mus, in his Muses. But Cratinus, in his Pluti, says\u2014 \n For I'm a thunnis, a mel\u00e6nas, or \n A thunnus, orphos, grayling, eel, or sea-dog. \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on Fishes, says that the thunnis is a\n gregarious fish, and also a migratory one. But Archestratus, who is so fond of\n petty details, says\u2014 \n And then the thunna's tail, which I call thunnis, \n That mighty fish, whose home's Byzantium. \n Cut it in slices, and then roast it all \n With accurate care, strewing on nought but salt, \n Most thinly spread; then sprinkle a little oil; \n Then eat it hot, first dipping it in brine. \n Or if you like to eat them dry they're good; \n Like the immortal gods in character, \n And figure too; but if you once forget, \n And vinegar add to them, then you spoil them. \n And Antiphanes, in his P\u00e6derastes, says\u2014 \n And the middle slices take \n Of the choice Byzantian tunny, \n And let them be neatly hidden \n Under leaves from beet-root torn. \n Antiphanes also praises the tail of the thunnis, in his Couris, where he\n says\u2014 \n \n A. The man who's country bred likes not to eat \n Food from the sea extracted; unless indeed \n It comes quite close in shore. Such as some conger, \n Some ray, or tunny's . . . \n \n B. Which part of the tunny? \n \n A. The lower part. \n \n B. Well, you may eat that safely. \n \n A. All other fish I reckon cannibals. \n \n B. Do not you eat those fish with the ugly\n backs? \n \n A. Which? \n \n B. The fat eels which haunt Copais' lake. \n \n \n A. Aye, like a ploughman. For indeed I have \n A farm not far from that most dainty lake. \n But I impeach the eels now of desertion, \n For none at all were there the other day. \n And some of these iambics may be found in the Acestria, and also in the\n Countryman, or Butalion. And Hiponax, as Lysanias quotes him in his treatise on\n the Iambic Poets, says\u2014 \n For one of them with rapid extravagance \n Feasting each day on tunnies and on cheese-cakes,, \n Like any eunuch of rich Lampsacus, \n Ate up his whole estate. So that he now \n Is forced to work and dig among the rocks,' \n Eating poor figs, and small stale loaves of barley, \n Food fit for slaves. \n And Strattis also mentions the thunnis, in his Callipides. \n ","67":"\n There is also a fish called the hippurus, or horsetail. Aristotle, in the fifth\n book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that the hippuri lay eggs, and\n that these are small at first, but come to a great size, like those of the lam-\n prey; and that they bring forth their young in the spring. But Dorion, in his book\n upon Fish, says that the hippurus is also called the coryph\u00e6na. But Icesius calls\n it the hippuris; and Epicharmas also mentions them in his Hebe's Wedding, saying\u2014\n \n The sharp-nosed needle-fish, \n And the hippurus, and bright chrysophrys. \n But Numenius, in his treatise on the Art of Fishing, speaking of the\n nature of the fish, says that it keeps continually leaping out of the water; on\n which account it is also called the Tumbler. And he uses the following expressions\n about it:\u2014 \n Or the great synodons, or tumbler hippurus. \n And Archestratus says\u2014 \n Th' hippurus of Carystus is the best, \n And indeed all Carystian fish are good. \n And Ep\u00e6netus, in his Cookery Book, says that it is called also the\n coryphoena. \n ","68":"\n There is another fish called the horse; and perhaps it is the same which\n Epicharmus calls the hippidion, or little horse, when he says\u2014 \n The coracinus colour'd like a crow, \n Fat, well-fed fish; the smooth hippidion, \n The phyc\u00e6 and the tender squill . . . \n \n And Numenius, in his Art, of Fishing, says\u2014 \n The char, the mighty tench of size enormous, \n The channus, and the eel; and he who roves \n By night, the wary pitynus; the mussel, \n The horse-fish, or the sea-green corydulis. \n And Antimachus the Colophonian mentions it in his Thebais, where he says\u2014\n \n The hyca, or the horse-fish, or the one \n Which they do call the thrush. \n \n \n ","69":"\n There is a fish, too, called the ioulis, concerning which Dorion says, in his\n treatise on Fishes, Recollect that if you boil the ioulis, you must do it\n in brine; and if you roast them, you must roast them with marjoram. And\n Numenius says\u2014 \n And ne'er neglect the medicine which keeps off \n To a great degree the greedy fish ioulis, \n And scolopendrus that doth poison dart. \n But the same writer calls them ioulus, and the entrails of the earth, in\n the following lines:\u2014 \n Moreover do not then the bait forget, \n Which on the highest hills that fringe the shore \n Shall soon be found. And they are called iouli, \n Black, eating earth-the entrails of the earth; \n Or the long-footed grasshopper, what time \n The sandy rocks are sprinkled with the foam \n Of the high-rising tide. Then dig them up, \n And stow them carefully within your bag. \n \n \n ","70":"\n There are also fish called \u03ba\u03af\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7, the sea-thrush,\n and \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c3\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, the sea-blackbird. The Attic writers\n call the first \u03ba\u03af\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7, with an \u03b7; and the reason is as follows:\u2014All the feminine nouns\n which end in \u03bb\u03b1 have another \u03bb before the \u03bb\u03b1; as \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1, \u03c3\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1, \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1, \u1f05\u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1, \u1f05\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 : but those\n which end in \u03bb\u03b7 do not require a \u03bb to precede the \u03bb\u03b7; as\n \u1f41\u03bc\u03af\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7, \u03c6\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b7, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7, \u03b1\u1f34\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7, \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7, and, in\n like manner, \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7. Cratinus says\u2014 \n Suppose a man had eaten a red mullet ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd ), \n Would that alone prove him an epicure? \n And Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesomes, says,\n Those fish which are called rocky fish have tender flesh; such as the\n sea-blackbird, the sea-thrush, the perch, the tench, the phyca, the\n alphesticus. But Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing\u2014 \n \n The sea-born race of grayling or of orphus, \n The black-flesh'd blackbird, or the dainty sea-thrush \n Sporting beneath the waves. \n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n Bambradones, sea-thrushes, and sea-hares; \n And the bold dragon fish. \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on What concerns Animals, says, And\n the fishes with black spots, like the sea-blackbird; and the fishes with\n variegated spots, like the sea-thrush. But Pancrates the Arcadian, in\n his Works of the Sea, says that the sea-thrush is called by many names:\u2014 \n Add now to these the sea-thrush red, which they \n Who seek to snare the wary fish with bait \n Do call the saurus, and th' \u00e6olias, \n Add too th' orphiscus with his large fat head. \n And Nicander, in the fourth book of his Transformed People, says\u2014 \n The scarus or the thrush with many names. \n \n \n ","71":"\n There is also the sea-boar and the cremys. Aristotle, in his treatise on Animals,\n says, But some fish have no teeth and smooth skins, like the needle-fish;\n and some have stony heads, like the cremys; and some are harsher, with rough\n skins, like the sea-boar; and some are marked down the back with two lines,\n like the seserinus; and some are marked with many lines and with red spots,\n like the salpe. And both Dorion and Ep\u00e6natus mention the sea-boar; and\n Archestratus says\u2014 \n But when you go to Acta's favour'd land, \n If you by chance should see a rich sea-boar, \n Buy it at once, and let it not escape you, \n Not if you buy it at its weight in gold; \n Else will the indignation of the gods \n O'erpower you; for 'tis the flower of nectar. \n But 'tis not all men who can be allow'd \n To eat this dainty, no, nor e'en to see it; \n Unless they take a strongly-woven mesh \n Of marsh-bred rush, and hold it in their hands, \n Well used to ply the floats with rapid mind. \n And with these dainties you must offer up, \n Thrown on the ground, some gifts of lamb and mutton. \n \n \n ","72":"\n There is also the harp-fish. Aristotle, in his treatise on Animals, or on Fish,\n says, The harp-fish has serrated teeth, is a fish of solitary habits, he\n lives on seaweed; he has a very loose tongue, and a white\n and broad heart. Pherecrates, in his Slave-Tutor, says\u2014 \n The harp-fish is a good fish; be you sure \n To buy him when you can. He really is good; \n But, I by Ph\u0153bus swear, this does perplex me \n Exceedingly which men do say, my friend, \n That there is secret harm within this harp-fish. \n Epicharmus says, in his Marriage of Hebe\u2014 \n There were hy\u00e6nides, \n And fine buglossi, and the harp-fish too \n And Apollodorus has said that, on account of his name, he was considered\n to be sacred to Apollo. And Callias, or Diodes, whichever was the author of the\n play, says in the Cyclops\u2014 \n A roasted harp-fish, and a ray, \n And the head of a well-fed tunny. \n And Archestratus, in his Luxurious Way of Living, says\u2014 \n I counsel you always to boil a harp-fish \n If he is white and full of firmish meat; \n But if he's red and also no great size, \n Then it were best, when you have prick'd him o'er \n With a new sharpen'd knife, to roast him gently. \n Sprinkle him then with oil and plenteous cheese, \n For he does like to see men liberal, \n And is himself intemperate. \n \n \n ","73":"\n There is also the cordylus. Aristotle calls this fish an amphibious animal, and\n says that it dies if it is dried by the sun. But Numenius, in his book on the Art\n of Fishing, calls it the courylus:\u2014 \n All things are ready. First I strip the thighs \n Of courylus, or pirene, and treat too \n In the same way the marine grasshopper. \n He also speaks of the fish called the cordylis, in these lines\u2014 \n Mussels, sea-horses, or the sea-green cordylis. \n \n \n ","74":"\n There is also a fish called cammorus. Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe, says\u2014\n \n Then after this there are boaces and \n Smarides, anchovies, also cammori. \n And Sophron, in his Female Farces, mentions them. But they are a species\n of squill, and this name was given them by the Romans. \n ","75":"\n There is also a fish called the carcharias. Numenius of Heraclea, in his Art of\n Fishing, says\u2014 \n \n At times you may too a carcharias catch, \n At times a psamathis who loves the surf. \n And Sophron, in his Tunny-hunter, says, But if your stomach\n happens to have swallowed a carcharias. But Nicander the Colophonian,\n in his essay on Dialects, says that the carcharias is also called the lamias and\n the squill. \n ","76":"\n There is also the cestreus. Icesius says, if the fish which are called by\n one general name of leucisci there are many sorts; for some are called cephali,\n and some cestres, and some chellones, and some myxini. But the cephali are the\n best both in flavour and juiciness; the next to them are those called the\n cestres; the myxini are inferior to either. But the worst of all are the\n chellones, which are called bacchi; and they are all full of wholesome juice,\n not very nutritious, but very digestible. And Dorion, in his essay on\n Fish, mentions the sea cestreus, but does not approve of the river one. And the\n sea cestreus he subdivides into two species\u2014the cephalus and the nestis. But the\n cestreus, which is like the sea-urchin about the head, he calls sphondylus. And he\n says that the cephalinus differs from the cephalus, and that this last is\n also called the blepsias. But Aristotle says, in the fifth book of his\n treatise on the Parts of Animals, But of the different kinds of cestreus,\n the chellones begin to be pregnant in the month Poseideon; so does the sargus\n and the fish called the myxus; and so does the cephalus: and they go thirty\n days with young. But some of the cestres are not generated by copulation, but\n are produced by the slime and the sand. \n \n And in other places Aristotle says, The cestreus is a fish with serrated\n teeth, but he does not eat other fishes; and, indeed, he is in no respect\n carnivorous. But of these fish there are several kinds\u2014the cephalus, the\n chellon, and the pher\u00e6us. And the chellon feeds close to land, but the pher\u00e6us\n does not; and they use the following food\u2014the pher\u00e6us uses the mucus which\n proceeds from itself, and the chellon eats slime and sand. It is said, also,\n that the spawn of the cestreus is not eaten by any other fish, just as the\n cestreus also eats no other fish. But Euthydemus the Athenian, in his\n treatise on Cured Fish, says that the spheneus and the dactyleus are both\n different species of cestres; and also that there is a species which are called\n cephali, because they have very large heads. And those which are called\n spheneus, are called so because \n they are thin and four-cornered; and the dactyleis are not so thick as two\n fingers. But the most excellent of the cestres are those which are caught near\n Abdera, as Archestratus has told us; and the second-best are those which come from\n Sinope. \n ","77":"\n But the cestres are called by some writers plotes, as Polemo says, in his treatise\n on the Rivers in Sicily. And Epicharmus, in his Muses, gives them this name\u2014\n \n Aeolians, and plotes, and cynoglossi. \n There also were sciathides. \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on the Dispositions and Way of Living of\n Animals, says that the cestres live even if they are deprived of their\n tails. But the cestreus is eaten by the pike, and the conger is eaten by the\n turbot. And there is an often-quoted proverb, The cestreus is\n fasting, which is applied to men who live with strict regard to\n justice, because the cestreus is never carnivorous. Anaxilas, in his Morose Man,\n attacking Maton the Sophist for his gluttony, says\u2014 \n Maton seized hold of a large cestreus' head, \n And ate it all. But I am quite undone. \n And that beautiful writer, Archestratus, says\u2014 \n Buy if you can a cestreus which has come \n From the sea-girt Aegina; then you shall \n For well-bred men be fitting company. \n Diocles, in his Sea, says\u2014 \n The cestreus leaps for joy. \n \n \n ","78":"\n But that the nestes are a kind of cestreus, Archippus tells us, in his Hercules\n Marrying:\u2014 \n Nestes cestres, cephali. \n And Antiphanes, in his Lampon, says\u2014 \n But all the other soldiers which you have \n Are hungry ( \u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ) cestres. \n And Alexis, in his Phrygian, says\u2014 \n So I a nestis cestreus now run home. \n Ameipsias says, in his Men playing at the Cottabus\u2014 \n \n A. And I will seek the forum, there to find \n Some one to take my work. \n \n B. I wish you would, \n You would all have less time to follow me, \n Like any hungry ( \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 ) cestreus. \n And Euphron says, in his Ugly Woman\u2014 \n Midas then is a cestreus-see, he walks \n Along the city fasting ( \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 ). \n \n And Philemon says, in his Men dying together\u2014 \n I bought me now a nestis cestreus roasted \n Of no great size. \n Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, says\u2014 \n Is there within a colony of man cestres? \n For that they all are \u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 you know. \n Anaxandrides says, in his Ulysses\u2014 \n He usually goes supperless about, \n Like a cestrinus nestis. \n And Eubulus, in his Nausicaa, says\u2014 \n Who has been drown'd 'tis now four days ago, \n Leading the life of a sad nestis cestreus. \n \n \n ","79":"\n When all this had been said about this nice dish of fish, one of the cynics coming\n late in the evening said, \"My friends, are we, too, keeping a fast, as if this\n were the middle day of the Thesmophoria, since we are now fasting like cestres\n For, as Diphilus says, in his Lemnian Women\u2014 \n These men have supp'd, but I, wretch that I am, \n Shall be a cestreus through th' extreme of fasting. \n And Myrtilus answering, said\u2014 \n But stand in order\u2014 \n as the Hedychares of Theopompus says\u2014 \n hungry band of cestres, \n You who are fed, like geese, on vegetables. \n For you shall not take a share of any of these things before either you,\n or your fellow-pupil Ulpian, tell me why the cestreus is the only fish which is\n called the faster. And Ulpian said,\u2014It is because he never takes any living bait;\n and when he is caught, it is neither effected by any meat nor by any living\n animal; as Aristotle tells us, when he says perhaps his being hungry makes\n him lazy; and also that when he is frightened he hides his head,\n as if by so doing he concealed his whole body. But Plato, in his\n Holidays, says\u2014 \n As I was going out I met a fisherman, \n And he was bringing me some cestres, and \n He brought me all those worthless starving fish. \n But do you tell me, O you Thessalian wrestler, Myrtilus! why it is that\n fish are called by the poets \u1f14\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3? And he\n said,\u2014It is because they are voiceless; but some insist upon it that, by strict\n analogy, the word ought to be \u1f34\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2, because\n they are deprived of voice: for the verb \u1f34\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \n means to be deprived, and \u1f44\u03c8 \n means voice. And are you ignorant of this, when you are an \u1f14\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c8 yourself? But I, as the wise Epicharmus says, when this dog\n makes me no answer,\u2014 \n Am by myself enough well to reply \n To what two men have lately said before me. \n And I say that they are called \u1f14\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 \n from being covered with scales, [the word coming from the same root, and being\n equivalent to \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2]. But I will tell you\n (though that is not a question which has been asked) why the Pythagoreans, who do\n touch other living creatures, though sparingly, and who allow themselves even to\n sacrifice some, absolutely abstain altogether from fish alone. Is it because of\n their silence for they think silence a very divine quality. Since, then, you, O\n you Molossian dogs, are always silent, but are still not Pythagoreans, we will now\n go on to the rest of the discussion about fish. \n ","80":"\n There is a fish called the coracinus. The coracini, which are caught at sea, says\n Icesius, contain but little nourishment; but they are easily secreted, and have a\n moderate supply of good juice. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of\n Animals, says that it happens to nearly all fish to have a rapid growth,\n and this is the case, in no small degree, with the coracinus; and he lays his\n eggs close to the land, in places full of weeds and moss. But\n Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Similitudes, says that the\n blacktail and the coracinus are much alike. But Numenius, in his Treatise on the\n Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n It easily would attract the spotted coracinus. \n And perhaps the \u00e6oli\u00e6 mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Muses, may be the\n same as coracini. For Epicharmus says\u2014 \n Aeoli\u00e6, plotes, cynoglossi too. \n But, in his Hebe's Marriage, he speaks of the \u00e6oli\u00e6 as a different fish;\n for he says\u2014 \n There there were mussels, and the alphastic fish, \n And coracini like to coriander seed, \n Aeoli\u00e6, plotes too, and the cynoglossi. \n But Euthydemus, in his essay on Cured Fish, says that the coracinus is by\n many people called the saperda. And Hera- cleon the Ephesian\n has said much the same thing; and so has Philotimus, in his Cookery Book. But that\n the saperdas and the coracinus are both called the platistacus is affirmed by\n Parmeno the Rhodian, in the first book of his Culinary Doctrine. But Aristophanes,\n in his Telmessians, uses the expression black-finned coracini. \n \n Pherecrates also uses the word in its diminutive form, in his Forgetful Man, where\n he says\u2014 \n Being with your \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 and \u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n And Amphis says, in his Ialemus\u2014 \n Whoever eats a sea-born coracinus \n When he may have a grayling, is a fool. \n But the coracini of the Nile are very sweet and delicious in their flesh,\n as those who have tried them know; and they have got their name from continually\n moving their eyes ( \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd ), and\n never ceasing. But the Alexandrians call them plataces, which is, more correctly\n speaking, the name of the whole genus. \n ","81":"\n There is also a fish called the cyprinus, or carp. He also, as Aristotle tells us,\n is a carnivorous and gregarious fish; and he has his tongue, not in the lower part\n of the mouth, but in the upper part. But Dorion, mentioning him in his list among\n the lake and river fish, writes thus: A scaly fish, whom some people call\n the cyprinus. \n \n ","82":"\n There is also the tench. The tench is very juicy, as Icesius says,\n exceedingly attractive to the palate, very easily secreted, not very\n nutritious, nor is the juice which they give very wholesome. But, in delicacy\n of flavour, the white kind is superior to the black. But the flesh of the green\n tench is more dry, and devoid of fat; and they give a much smaller quantity of\n juice, and what they do give is thinner. Still they are more nutritious, on\n account of their size. Diodes says that those which are found in rocky\n situations are very tender. But Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, calls them,\n not \u03ba\u03ce\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, but \u03ba\u1ff6\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n A char or tench ( \u03ba\u1ff6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) of mighty size and\n bold. \n \n \n And Sophron, in his Countryman, speaks of The cothons, who bathe in\n mud; and perhaps it was from the name of this fish that he called the\n son of his Tunny-catcher, in the play, Cothonias. But it is the Sicilians who call\n the tench \u03ba\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd, as Nicander the Colophonian tells\n us, in his book on Dialects; and Apollodorus confirms the\n statement, in his treatise on the Modest and Temperate Man. But Epicharmus, in his\n Hebe's Marriage, names the tench, calling it \u03ba\u03ce\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 :\u2014 \n The turtle with their sting behind, and then the tender tench. \n And Antiphanes, in his Timon, praising the tench, tells us in what places\n they are to be found in the greatest perfection, in these lines:\u2014 \n I come, but I have been to great expense \n In buying viands for this marriage feast. \n I've bought a pennyworth of frankincense \n To offer to the gods and all the goddesses, \n And to the heroes I will offer cakes. \n But when I bid that rascally house-breaking \n Seller of fish to add a dainty dish, \n \n I'll throw you in, says he, \"the borough itself, \n For they are all Phalericans.\" The rest \n I do believe were selling our Otrynicans. \n \n Menander, in his Ephesians, says\u2014 \n \n A. There was a fishmonger not long ago, \n Who asked four whole drachmas for his tench. \n \n B. A mighty price indeed. \n And Dorion mentions river tench also, in his book on Fishes. \n ","83":"\n There is also a fish called the cuckoo-fish. Epicharmus says\u2014 \n And the beauteous cuckoos \n Which we split in twain, \n Then we roast and season them, \n And then with pleasure eat them. \n And Dorion says that one ought to roast them, first having split them\n down the back; and, having seasoned them with herbs, and cheese, and spice, and\n assaf\u0153tida, and oil, then one ought to turn them round, and oil them on the other\n side, and then to sprinkle them with a little salt; and, when one has taken them\n from the fire, to moisten them with vinegar. But Numenius gives it the epithet of\n red, from the facts of the case, saying\u2014 \n Eating sometimes the cuckoo red, sometimes \n A few pempherides, or else a lizard. \n \n \n ","84":"\n There is also a fish called the carcharias (or sharp- toothed\n dog). And Archestratus, whom we may call the Hesiod or Theognis of Epicures,\n speaks of this fish; for Theognis himself was not indifferent to luxury, as he\n admits, speaking of himself in these words:\u2014 \n But when the sun, driving his coursers fleet \n With solid hoofs along the heavenly road, \n Guides them at mid-day in the centre path, \n Then let us eat whate'er our heart may prompt, \n And gratify our appetite with dainties. \n Then let a Spartan maid with rosy hands, \n Bring water, and fresh garlands for our brows. \n Nor indeed was that wise man indifferent to the charms of boys; at all\n events, he speaks thus on the subject:\u2014 \n O Academus, would you now but sing \n A tuneful hymn, while in the midst should stand \n A beauteous boy, in flower of his youth, \n A prize for you and me to combat for, \n Then you should know how far the mule excels the ass. \n And Archestratus, in these beautiful suggestions of his, exhorts his\n friends in this way\u2014 \n In fair Torone's town 'tis best to cook \n The hollow entrails of the sharp-tooth'd dog. \n Then strew the fish with cummin, sparing be \n Of salt, then roast him, and add nothing else \n Saving some sea-green oil. Then when 'tis done, \n Serve him up with some little seasoning. \n And if you boil a part of it within \n The hollow of some flat dish, then add \n No water, add no wine-made vinegar, \n But pour on oil alone, and cummin dry, \n And add what fragrant herbs the garden gives. \n Then put the saucepan on the ashes hot, \n And boil it; let no flame too quickly burn, \n And stir it often lest the meat should catch, \n And spoil your dinner so, before you know it. \n 'Tis but few mortals know this wondrous food; \n And those who have thick stupid heavy souls,, \n Refuse to taste it, but are all alarm'd, \n Because they say this dog's a cannibal, \n And feeds on human flesh. But there is not \n A fish that swims which does not like man's flesh \n If he can only chance to come across it. \n There is a part of this fish which the Romans cal thursio, and which is\n very delicious, and much sought for as an article of luxury. \n ","85":"\n There is also the pike. These, as Aristotle reports, are a solitary and\n carnivorous fish; and they have a bony tongue, adhering to\n the mouth, and a triangular heart. But, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals,\n he says that they bring forth their young, like the cestres and chrysophryes do,\n chiefly in those places where rivers fall into the sea; and they bring forth in\n winter, and they also bring forth twice in the season. But Icesius says that the\n pike is very juicy, and not very nutritious; and that it is also not very easily\n secreted; but for delicacy of flavour it is accounted the very first of fish. And\n this fish has his name, \u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03be, from his voracity\n ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ). It is said, also, that in\n shrewdness he is superior to other fish, being very ingenious at devising means to\n save himself; on which account, Aristophanes the comic poet says\u2014 \n The pike, the wisest of all fish that swim. \n And Alc\u00e6us the lyric poet says that he swims very high in the water. But\n the wise Archestratus says\u2014 \n Take the large cestris cephalus from G\u00e6son, \n When you do come to fair Miletus' city. \n Take too the pike, the offspring of the gods. \n For in those waters both these fish are best. \n Such is the natural character of the place. \n But there are many places where they grow \n More fat and large; in famous Calydon, \n And in the opulent Ambracia, \n And at the Bolbe lake; but there they want \n The fragrant fat which here surrounds their belly; \n Nor have they such a pungent taste, my friend. \n Those which I speak of are most admirable. \n Take them and roast them without scaling them, \n Soften with salt, and serve them up with brine. \n And let no Syracusan, no Italian \n Break in upon you while you dress this dish: \n For they have no idea of dressing fish, \n But spoil them all by seasoning them with cheese, \n By sprinkling them with too much vinegar, \n And strongly scented assaf\u0153tida. \n They are good cooks enough to dress the vile \n Fish which they take while clinging to the rocks; \n And there are many kinds of season'd dishes \n Which they can dress quite well enough; but they \n Have no idea of dressing good fish plain. \n \n \n ","86":"\n And Aristophanes, in his Knights, speaks of the pike taken in the neighbourhood of\n Miletus as surpassingly good, when he speaks thus:\u2014 \n But you shall not disturb me thus \n Feasting on Milesian pike. \n \n And in his Lemnian Women he says\u2014 \n He would not buy a pike's head, nor a locust: \n speaking because the brain of the pike is a great delicacy, as is also\n that of the sea-grayling. And Eubulus, in his Muses, says\u2014 \n Do not be too expensive, still not mean, \n Whate'er you do; not for decency's sake. \n Get some small cuttle-fish, or squids, some nestis, \n Some small fry of the polypus, some tripe, \n And beestings and black-puddings; get besides \n A noble head of the Milesian pike. \n But the G\u00e6son, which is mentioned by Archestratus, means the lake\n G\u00e6sonis, which is between Priene and Miletus, con- nected with the sea, as\n Neanthes of Cyzicus tells us in the sixth book of his Hellenics. But Ephorus, in\n his fifth book, says that the G\u00e6son is a river near Priene, which flows into the\n lake G\u00e6sonis, And Archippus, in his Fishes, mentioning the pike, says\u2014 \n Hermes th' Egyptian is the greatest rogue \n Of all the fishmongers; he skins by force \n The sharks and rhinos, and takes out the entrails \n Of the Milesian pikes, before he sells them. \n \n \n ","87":"\n There is also a fish called the latus; and Archestratus says that the best fish of\n this kind is that which is taken off the coast of Italy, and he speaks thus\n concerning them:\u2014 \n Near the well-treed Italia's verdant shores, \n Fierce Scylla's strait the famous latus breeds, \n Most marvellous of dainties. \n But the lati which are found in the river Nile grow to such a size that\n they weigh more than two hundred pounds; and this fish is exceedingly white, and\n very delicious, dress it whatever way you choose. And it is like the fish called\n the glanis, which is found in the Danube. The Nile produces also many other kinds\n of fish, and they are all very delicious; but especially does it produce all the\n different coracini (for the are many different kinds of this fish). It also\n produces the fish called the m\u00e6otes, which are mentioned by Archippus, in his\n Fishes, in these words:\u2014 \n M\u00e6ot\u00e6, and saperd\u00e6, likewise glanides. \n And this fish is found in great numbers in Pontus; and they derive their\n name from the Palus M\u00e6otis. But the following, as far as I can recollect, from\n having been a long time absent from the country, are the\n names of the chief fish found in the Nile. The sweetest of all is the ray; then\n there is the sea-pig, the snub-nose, the phagrus, the oxyrhynchus, the allabes,\n the silurus, the synodontis, the elecoris, the eel, the thrissa, the abramis, the\n blind-fish, the scaly-fish, the bellows-fish, and the cestreus. And there are also\n a great number of others. \n ","88":"\n There is also a kind of shark, called the leiobatus, whose other name is the\n rhine; and he is a white-fleshed fish, as Ep\u00e6netus tells us in his Cookery Book.\n Plato says, in his Sophists\u2014 \n The galeus, the leiobatus, the eel. \n \n \n ","89":"\n There is also the lamprey. Theophrastus, in the fifth book of his treatise on\n those Animals which can live on dry Land, says that the eel and the lamprey can\n exist for a long time out of the water, because they have very small gills, and so\n receive but very little moisture into their system. But Icesius affirms that they\n are not less nutritious than the eel, nor even, perhaps, than the conger. And\n Aristotle, in his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that from the time that\n they are little they grow very rapidly, and that they have sharp serrated teeth;\n and that they keep on laying small-sized eggs every season of the year. But\n Epicharmus, in his Muses, calls them not \u03c3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, \n but \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, without the \u03c2; speaking in this way of them:\u2014 \n No congers fat were wanting, and no lampreys ( \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And Sophron, too, spells the word in the same manner. But Plato or\n Cantharus, in his Alliance, spells the word with the \u03c2, saying\u2014 \n The ray, the lamprey ( \u03c3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 ) too, is\n here. \n Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, says that the river lampreys have only\n one spine, like the kind of cod which is called gallarias. But Andreas, in his\n treatise on Poisonous Animals, says that those lampreys which are produced by a\n cross with the viper have a poisonous bite, and that that kind is less round than\n the other, and is variegated. But Nicander, in his Theriacus, says\u2014 \n That is a terrible deed the lamprey does, \n When oft its teeth it gnashes and pursues \n Th' unhappy fishermen, and drives them headlong \n Out of their boats in haste, when issuing forth \n From the deep hole in which it long has lain: \n \n If that the tale is true that it admits \n The poisonous viper's love, when it deserts \n Its pastures 'neath the sea, for food on land. \n But Andreas, in his treatise on Things which are believed erroneously,\n says that it is quite a mistake to suppose that the lamprey ever breeds with the\n viper when it comes on marshy ground; for that vipers do not themselves feed in\n marshes, as they are fond rather of sandy and desert places. But Sostratus, in his\n books on Animals (and there are two books of his on this subject, and with this\n title), agrees with those who assert that the lamprey and the viper do breed\n together. \n ","90":"\n There is another kind of eel also, called the myrus. But the myrus, as Aristotle\n says, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, differs from the\n lamprey; this latter being a variegated fish, and less powerful than the other;\n while the myrus is a fish of one uniform colour, and strong, and its whole colour\n is like that of the wryneck, and it has teeth both within and without. And Dorion\n says, that the myrus has no small bones running through its flesh, but that it is\n in every part eatable, and exceedingly soft; and that there are two kinds of it,\n for some are black, and some are of rather a fiery colour, but those which are\n dark are best. And Archestratus, the voluptuary philosopher, say\u2014 \n Between th' Italian and Sicilian shore, \n Where the strait parts them with its narrow waves, \n Whenever that most dainty fish is caught \n Which men the lamprey call, be sure to buy it; \n For in those waters'tis the best of food. \n \n \n ","91":"\n There is a fish, too, called the m\u00e6nis, or sprat; and Icesius says that they are\n more juicy than the tench, but that they are inferior in delicacy of flavour, and\n also in the extent to which they facilitate the secretions of the stomach. But\n Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things similar to one another,\n says that both the boax and the smaris resemble the sprat; and these two fishes,\n are mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Earth and Sea, in the following manner:\u2014\n \n When you see many boaces and smarides. \n And Ep\u00e6netus, in his Cookery Book, says, The smaris, which some\n people call cynoseuna. But Antiphanes, in his Coun- tryman, or\n Butalion, calls the sprats the food of Hecate, on account of\n their diminutive size; and the following is the passage:\u2014 \n \n A. Why, I did think that all these monstrous\n fish \n Were cannibals. \n \n B. What can you mean, my friend? \n \n A. Why, cannibals: so how would any man eat\n them? \n \n B. That's true. But these are food of Hecate, \n Which he is speaking of, just sprats and mullets. \n There is also one kind which is called the leucom\u00e6nis, or white sprat,\n which some people call the boax. Poliochus, in his Corinthiastes, says\u2014 \n Let no man, in God's name I beg, persuade you, \n Come when he will or whence, so to mistake \n As to call leucom\u00e6nides boaces. \n \n \n ","92":"\n There is also the melanurus, or black-tail; and concerning this fish Numenius\n says, in his Art of Fishing:\u2014 \n The scorpion or melanurus black, \n The guide and leader of the perch, \n But Icesius says that he is very like the sargus, but that he is inferior\n to the latter in the quantity and quality of his juice, and also in delicacy of\n flavour; but that he is rather exciting food, and very nutritious. And Epicharmus\n mentions him in his Hebe's Marriage:\u2014 \n There were sargini, there were melanuri. \n Aristotle too, in his treatise on Animals, writes thus: \"There are some\n fish which have barred or spotted tails, among which are the melanuri, and the\n sargi or sardine; and they have many lines on their skin, dark lines. But\n Speusippus affirms, in the second book of his treatise on Things similar to one\n another, that the fish called psyrus resembles the melanurus; but Numenius calls\n the psyrus, psorus, with an o, saying\u2014 \n The psorus, or the salpe, or the dragon-fish \n Which haunts the shore. \n \n \n ","93":"\n There is also a fish called the mormyrus, a most nutritious fish, as Icesius says.\n But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, calls it the myrmes, unless, at least, he\n means a different fish by this name. But his expression is\u2014 \n The sea-swallow, the myrmes too, \n And they are larger than the colias tunny. \n But Dorion, in his book upon Fishes, calls them mormylus, with a \u03bb. But Lynceus of Samos, in his treatise on the Art of\n buying Fish, which he addressed to some friend of his, who \n was very difficult to please when making his purchases, says, \"But it is not a\n useless plan, with reference to men who are obstinate, and who will not abate\n their price, when you are standing by to disparage their fish, quoting Archstratus\n (who wrote the book called The voluptuous Life), or some other poet, and repeating\n this verse:\u2014 \n The mormyrus that haunts the pebbly shore, \n Is a bad, good-for-nothing, worthless fish. \n And again you may quote\u2014 \n Buy an amia in the autumn . . . . \n 'But now 'tis spring.' And again you may proceed, if it should be the\n proper season\u2014 \n How good the cestreus is when winter comes. \n 'But now,' you will say, ' it is summer.' And you will go on in this way\n for some time; and in this way you will drive away a good many of those who are\n standing about, and who might become purchasers. So when you have done this, you\n will by this means compel the man to take whatever price you choose to give.\" \n ","94":"\n There is also the torpedo. Plato, or Cantharus, says, in the Alliance\u2014 \n A boil'd torpedo is delicious food. \n But Plato the Philosopher says, in the Meno, You seem very much to\n resemble the sea-torpedo; for that fish causes any one who comes near it to\n become torpid. And an allusion to the name occurs also in Homer, where\n he says\u2014 \n His hand was torpid ( \u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 ) at the\n wrist. \n But Menander, in his Phanus, uses the termination a, and says\u2014 \n A certain torpor ( \u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1 ) creeps o'er all my\n skin; \n though no one of the ancient writers ever used this form of the word. But\n Icesius says that it is a fish without much nutriment or much juice in it, but\n that it has some cartilaginous sort of substance diffused all over it, very good\n for the stomach. And Theophrastus, in his book on Animals which live in Holes,\n says that the torpedo works its way underground because of the cold. But in his\n treatise on Poisonous Animals, and on Animals which sting, he says that the\n torpedo can send the power which proceeds from it through wood, and through\n harpoons, so as to produce torpor in those who have them in\n their hands. But Clearchus the Solensian has explained the cause of this in his\n treatise on Torpor; but, since his explanation is rather a long one, I do not\n recollect his exact words, but will refer you to the treatise itself. \n But the torpedo, says Aristotle, is one of the cartilaginous and viviparous fish;\n and, to provide itself with food, it hunts after little fish, touching them, and\n causing them all to become torpid and motionless. And Diphilus of Laodicea, in his\n essay on the Theriaca of Nicander, says that it is not every part of the animal\n which produces this torpor, but only some particular parts of it; and he says that\n he has arrived at this fact by a long series of experiments. But Archestratus\n speaks of\u2013 \n A bold torpedo done in oil and wine, \n And fragrant herbs, and some thin grated cheese. \n Alexis, in his Galatea, says\u2014 \n I counsel you to season well and stuff \n Torpedos whole, and then to roast them thoroughly. \n And in his Demetrius he says\u2014 \n Then I took a torpedo, calculating \n If my wife touch'd it with her tender fingers \n That they would get no hurt from its backbone. \n \n \n ","95":"\n There is also the sword-fish. Aristotle says that this fish has its lower jaw\n short, but its upper one bony, long, and in fact as large as all the rest of the\n body of the fish; and this upper jaw is what is called the sword; but that this\n fish has no teeth. And Archestratus says\u2014 \n But take a slice of sword-fish when you go \n To fair Byzantium, and take the vertebrae \n Which bend his tail. He's a delicious fish, \n Both there and where the sharp Pelorian cape \n Juts out towards the sea. \n Now, who is then so great a general, or so great a critic in dishes and\n banquets, as this poet from Gela (or, I should rather say, from Catagela), who, for the sake of his\n epicurism, sailed through those straits; and who also, for the sake of the same\n epicurism, investigated the different qualities and juices of each separate part\n of every fish, as if he had been laying the foundation of some science which was\n useful to human life? \n \n ","96":"\n There is also a fish called the orphos ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 );\n but the word is also spelt with an \u03bf ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 ), as Pamphilus tells us. But Aristotle, in the\n fifth book of his Parts of Animals, where he says that the growth of most fish is\n very rapid, says, \u201cThe orphos also grows to a large fish from a little one with\n great rapidity; but he is a carnivorous fish, with serrated teeth, and of a\n solitary disposition. And there is this peculirity in him, that it cannot be\n ascertained what means he has of propagating his species, and that he can live a\n long time after he has been cut in pieces. He is also one of those fish which bury\n themselves in holes during the winter season, and he is fond of keeping close to\n the land, rather than of going into the deep sea; but he does not live more than\n two years. And Numenius, speaking of this fish, says\u2014 \n Now with such baits as these it is not hard \n To draw the lengthy scorpion from his bed, \n Or the rough orphus: for they're easily caught. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n The grayling, or the sea-born race of orphi, \n Or the dark flesh'd sea-blackbird. \n But Dorion says that the young orphus is called by some the orphacines.\n And Archippus says, in his Fishes,\u2014 \n The orphus came to them, the priest o' the god. \n And Cratinus says, in his Ulysses,\u2014 \n A hot slice of the newly taken orphus. \n And Plato, in his Cleophon, says\u2014 \n For he has brought you here, old dame, to dwell, \n A rotten food for orphi and for phagri, \n And other gristly boneless fish around. \n \n \n And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, says\u2014 \n If a man be inclined to purchase orphi, \n And likes to leave alone the membrades. \n Now this word \u1f40\u03c1\u03c6\u1f7c\u03c2, in the nominative\n case singular, is accented with an acute on the ultima by the Attic writers; so\n Archippus writes the word, in his Fishes, in the lines which I have already\n quoted; and Cratinus also, in his Uysses, as I have above quoted it, writes\u2014\n \n \n \u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c1\u03c6\u1f7c \u03c7\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd. \n \n \n \n ","97":"\n There is also a fish called orcynus. Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, says that\n the orcyni come from the sea near the Pillars of Hercules to the: waters on our\n costs; on which account, a great number are taken in the\n Iberian and Tyrrhenian seas; and that from thence they are dispersed over the rest\n of the sea. But Icesius says that those which are caught near Cadiz are the\n fattest, and next to them those which are taken near Sicily. But that those which\n are taken at any great distance from the Pillars of Hercules have very little fat\n on them, because they have swum a very great distance. Accordingly, at Cadiz, it\n is only the shoulders by themselves which are dried and cured; as also it is only\n the jaws and palate of the sturgeon, and that part which is called the melandryas,\n which is cured. But Icesius says that the entrails are very rich, and very\n different in flavour from the other parts; and that the parts about the shoulders\n are superior even to these. \n ","98":"\n There is also the cod and the hake. The cod, says Aristotle, in his work on Living\n Animals, has a large wide mouth like the shark, and he is not a gregarious fish;\n and he is the only fish which has his heart in his stomach, and in his brain he\n has stones like millstones. And he is the only fish who buries himself in a hole\n in the hot weather, when the Dog-star rages; for all others take to their holes in\n the winter season. And these fish are mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Hebe's\n Wedding:\u2014 \n And there are channel with their large wide mouths, \n And cod with their huge bellies. \n But the cod is different from the hake, as Dorion tells us, in his work\n upon Fish, where he writes thus: The \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \n (cod), which some call \u03b3\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2. \n There is also the gallerides, which some call a hake, and some a maxinus.\n But Euthydemus, in his work on Cured Fish, says, Some call this fish the\n bacchus, and some call it the gelaria, and some call it the hake. But\n Archestratus says\u2014 \n Anthedon's famous for its cod, which some \n Do call gallerias; there its size is great, \n But the flesh spongy, and in many respects \n I do not think it good, though others praise it. \n But this man likes one thing, and that another. \n \n \n ","99":"\n There is the polypus, declined \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2,\n \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2; at least this is the way the Attic writers use the word,\n and so does Homer:\u2014 \n As when a polypus ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 in the\n genitive) is dragged from out his lair: \n \n keeping the analogy to the noun \u03c0\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, from which it is de- rived. But in the accusative case we find\n the form \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, just as we \u02bc\u1f00\u03bb\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd and \u03bf\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd. \n Aeschylus, too, has the form \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, as an\n epithet of a caldron, in his Athamas, from \u03c0\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, \n as if it were a simple noun like \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2. But the\n form \u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 is Aeolic. For the Attics always say\n \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. Aristophanes, in his D\u00e6dalus, says\u2014\n \n When then I had this polypus ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ) and\n cuttle-fish. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n He put before me a polypus ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd ). \n And in another place he has\u2014 \n They are the blows of a polypus press'd tight. \n And Alc\u00e6us says, in his Adulterous Sisters,\u2014 \n The man's a fool and has the mind of a polypus ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n But Ameipsias, in his Glutton, says\u2014 \n I want, it seems, a heap of polypi ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd ). \n And Plato, in his Boy, writes\u2014 \n First of all you like the polypodes ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2\n \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n Alc\u00e6us in another passage says\u2014 \n I myself eat like any polypus ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ). \n But others use the accusative case \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1, in strict analogy with \u03c0\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2,\n \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u1f76, \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b1. Eupolis, in his Demi, has\u2014 \n The man's a fellow-citizen of mine, \n A very polypus in disposition. \n \n \n ","100":"\n Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesome Things, says\u2014 The\n molluscous fish are calculated to give pleasure, and to excite the amorous\n propensities; especially the polypi ( \u03bf\u1f31\n \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ). And Aristotle relates that the polypus has\n eight feet, of which the two highest and the two lowest are the smallest, and\n those in the middle are the largest; and they have also two feelers, with which\n they bring their food to their mouth. And they have their eyes placed above their\n two upper feet; and their mouth and teeth are between their feet. And when the\n polypus is dissected, he has a brain divided into two parts; and what is called\n his ink is not black, like the cuttle-fish, but of a reddish colour, in that part\n of him which is called the poppy; but the poppy lies above the stomach, like a\n bladder: and it has no intestines, like other fish. But for food it uses at times\n the flesh of small shell-fish, and casts the shells outside its body; by which the\n hunters know where to find it. And it propagates its\n species by becoming intertwined with the female, and is a long time about it,\n because it is destitute of blood: and it ejects its young through the orifice\n which is called the spiracle, which is the only passage for its body; and it lays\n eggs in clusters, like bunches of grapes. \n ","101":"\n They say, also, that the polypus, when it is in want of food, will eat even\n itself. And among those who relate this fact is Pherecrates the comic poet; for\n he, in the play entitled The Countryman, says\u2014 \n They live on green anthrysca, and on bracana, \n And snails and slugs. And when they're very hungry, \n Then, like the polypus, they e'en at night \n Nibble their fingers. \n And Diphilus, in his Merchant, says\u2014 \n A polypus with all his feelers \n And limbs unhurt; whose wicked tooth \n Has not devour'd himself, my friend, \n Is ready for our supper. \n But all this is a mistake; for the fact is, that he is pursued by the\n congers, and has his feet hurt in that manner. And it is said that if any one\n strews salt over his hole, he immediately comes out. It is also affirmed, that\n when he flies in alarm, he changes his colour, and becomes like the places in\n which he conceals himself. As also Theognis of Megara says, in his Elegies\u2014 \n Remark the tricks of that most wary polypus, \n Who always seems of the same colour and hue \n As is the rock near which he lies. \n And Clearchus makes a similar statement in the second book of his\n treatise on Proverbs, where he quotes the following lines, without saying from\n whose writings they come\u2014 \n My son, my excellent Amphilochus, \n Copy the shrewd device o' the polypus, \n And make yourself as like as possible \n To those whose land you chance to visit. \n \n \n ","102":"\n And the same Clearchus says that, in olden time, about Tr\u0153zen, it was considered\n impious to try to catch either the polypus, which was called sacred, or that one\n which was called the rower. And it was contrary to law to eat either that or the\n sea-tortoise. But the polypus is a fish very apt to decay, and also very stupid;\n for it goes towards the hand of the people who are pursuing it: and sometimes even\n when it is pursued, it does not attempt to get out of the\n way. Their females waste away after laying their eggs, and get powerless; by\n reason of which they are easily taken. And sometimes they have been seen leaving\n the sea, and going on dry land, especially towards any rough or rugged ground; for\n they shun smooth places: and of all plants they especially delight in the olive,\n and they are often found embracing the trunk of an olive with their feelers. They\n have also been discovered clinging to such fig-trees as grow near the seashore,\n and eating the figs, as Clearchus tells us, in his treatise on those Animals which\n live in the Water. And this also is a proof that they are fond of the olive,\u2014that\n if any one drops a branch of this tree down into the sea, in a place where there\n are polypi, and holds it there a little time, he without any trouble draws up as\n many polypi as he pleases, clinging to the branch. And all their other parts are\n exceedingly strong, but their neck is weak. \n ","103":"\n It is also said that the male has something corresponding to the parts of\n generation of one of his arms, in which there are his two large feelers; and that\n it is a limb full of nerves, sticking to the arm all along as far as the middle.\n But, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle\n says\u2014 The polypus propagates his species in the winter, and brings forth\n in the spring; and it lies in its hole for about two months: and it is a very\n prolific animal. But the male differs from the female, both in having a longer\n head, and also in having what the fishermen call its parts of generation in one\n of its feelers. And when it brings forth, it sits on its eggs, on which account\n it is worse to eat at that season; and the polypus lays its eggs either in its\n bed, or in any potsherd, or hollow place or vessel of that sort. And after\n fifty days, the little polypi come forth out of the egg in immense numbers,\n like young spiders. But the female polypus sometimes sits upon the eggs, and\n sometimes clings to the mouth of the bed, holding on with one of its\n feelers. Theophrastus, in his treatise on those Animals which change\n their Colour, says that the polypus generally becomes like only to those places\n which are rocky, doing this both out of fear and for the sake of protecting\n itself. But, in his book on those Animals which live on dry Land, he says that the\n polypi are not fond of sea-water. But, in his treatise on those Things which are\n different according to the Differences of their Situation,\n Theophrastus says that there are no polypi about the Hellespont; for that that sea\n is cold, and not very salt, and that both these circumstances are unfavourable to\n the polypus. \n ","104":"\n \n But the fish called the nautilus, says Aristotle, is not a\n polypus, though it resembles a polypus in its feelers. And the back of the\n nautilus is covered with a shell; and it rises up out of the bottom of the sea,\n having its shell upon its back, in order that it may not catch the water. But\n when it has turned round, then it sails on, putting up two of its feelers,\n which have a thin membrane growing between them, just as the feet of some birds\n are which have a membrane of skin between their toes. And their other two\n feelers they let down into the sea, instead of rudders; but when they see\n anything coming towards them, then out of fear they draw in those feet, and\n fill themselves with salt water, and so descend to the bottom as rapidly as\n possible. But, in his treatise on Animals and Fishes, he says\u2014 Of\n the polypi there are two sorts; one, that which changes its colour, the other\n the nautilus. \n \n ","105":"\n Now, on this nautilus there is an epigram quoted of Callimachus of Cyrene, which\n runs thus:\u2014 \n I was a shell, O Venus Zephyritis, \n \n Now I'm the pious offering of Selena, \n The gentle nautilus. When balmy winds \n Breathe soft along the sea, I hold my course, \n Stretching my sails on their congenial yards. \n Should calm, the placid goddess, still the waves, \n I row myself along with nimble feet, \n So that my name suits rightly with my acts. \n Now have I fallen on the Iulian shore, \n To be a pleasant sport to Arsinoe. \n No more shall Halcyons' dew-besprinkled eggs, \n My dainty meal, lie thick within my bed \n As formerly they did, since here I lie. \n But give to Cleinias's daughter worthy thanks; \n For she does shape her conduct honestly, \n And from Aeolian Smyrna doth she come. \n Posidippus also wrote this epigram on the same Venus which is worshipped\n in Zephyrium:\u2014 \n Oh, all ye men who traffic on the streams, \n Or on the land who hold a safer way, \n \n Worship this shrine of Philadelphus' wife, \n Venus Arsinoe, whom Callicrates, \n The naval leader, first did firmly place \n On this most beautiful Zephyrian shore. \n And she will on your pious voyage smile, \n And amid storms will for her votaries \n Smooth the vex'd surface of the wide-spread sea. \n Ion the tragedian also mentions the polypus, in his Ph\u0153nix, saying,\u2014\n \n I hate the colour-changing polypus, \n Clinging with bloodless feelers to the rocks. \n \n \n ","106":"\n Now the different species of polypus are these: the eledone, the polypodine, the\n bolbotine, the osmylus; as both Aristotle and Speusippus teach us. But, in his\n book on Animals and their Properties, Aristotle says that the polypus, the\n osmylus, the eledone, the cuttle-fish, and the squid, are all molluscous.\n Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n A polypus, a cuttle-fish, and quickly-moving squid, \n A foul-smelling bolbitine, and chattering old woman. \n And Archestratus says\u2014 \n The Carian and the Thasian polypi \n Are far the best; Corcyra too can breed \n Fish of large size and very numerous. \n But the Dorians spell the word with an \u03c9,\n \u03c0\u03c9\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2; as, for instance, Epicharmus. Simonides too has the\n expression, \u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b6\u03ae\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. But the Attics\n spell the word \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, with an o: and it is a\n cartilaginous fish; for \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 and \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 have the same meaning;\u2014 \n The polypodes and the dog-shark. \n Moreover, all the fish belonging to the species of the cuttlefish are\n called molluscous. But the whole tribe of . . . is cartilaginous. \n ","107":"\n There is also a fish called the pagurus; and it is mentioned by Timocles or\n Xenarchus, in his Purple, thus\u2014 \n But I, as being a skilful fisherman, \n Have carefully devised all sorts of arts \n To catch those vile paguri, enemies \n To all the gods and all the little fishes. \n And shall I not without delay beguile \n An old buglossus? That would be well done. \n \n \n ","108":"\n There is also the pelamys. Phrynichus mentions it in his Muses; and Aristotle, in\n the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says the pelamydes and the\n tunnies breed in the Black Sea, but not anywhere else.\n Sophocles also mentions them, in his Shepherds:\u2014 \n There, too, the foreign pelamys does winter, \n The stranger from the Hellespont. For she \n Doth come with many of her kind in summer \n To these cool waters of the Bosphorus. \n \n \n ","109":"\n Then there is the perch. He also is mentioned by Diodes; and Speusippus, in the\n second book of his treatise on Things Resembling one another, says that the perch,\n the canna, and the phycis are all nearly alike. And Epicharmus says\u2014 \n The comaris, the sea-dog, and the cestra \n And variegated perch. \n And Numenius, in his treatise on the Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n At one time perch, and at another strophades, \n Which keep around the rocks. The phycis too, \n Th' alphestes, and the red-flesh'd scorpion. \n There is also the phycis. This also is mentioned by Epichar- mus, in his\n Hebe's Wedding; and by Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things\n Resembling one another; and by Numenius: all whose testimonies are at hand.\n Aristotle, in his book upon Animals and their Properties, says that the phycis is\n surrounded with prickles and spotted. But the perch is marked with lines, and with\n bars running in an oblique direction. And there is a proverb also, The\n perch follows the black-tail. \n \n ","110":"\n We have also the needle-fish. This also is mentioned by Epicharmus, who says\u2014\n \n The oxyrhynchi, and the needle-fish, \n And the hippuri. \n But Dorion, in his work on Fish, says\u2014 The belone, which they also\n call the needle-fish. Aristotle too, in the fifth book of his Parts of\n Animals, calls this fish the belone. But, in his book on Animals and their\n Properties, or else in his work on Fishes, he calls it the needle-fish; and says\n that it has no teeth. And Speusippus calls it the belone. \n ","111":"\n There is also the rhine. Dorion, in his book on Fishes, says that the rhinos are\n best at Smyrna; and that all the cartilaginous fish are especially good in the\n gulf of Smyrna. And Archestratus says\u2014 \n And the far-famed Miletus does produce \n All cartilauginous fish in high perfection, \n \n But first of all one ought to take account \n Both of the rhina and leiobatus, \n Known for his spacious back. Still before all \n Give me a roasted crocodile to eat, \n Fresh from the oven, a most dainty dish \n For all the children of Ionia. \n \n \n ","112":"\n There is next the scarus, or char. Aristotle says that this fish has serrated\n teeth, and is a solitary fish, and carnivorous; and that it has a small mouth, and\n a tongue which does not adhere closely to the mouth, and a triangular heart of a\n whitish colour and with three lobes; and that its gall and spleen are black, and\n that of its gills one is double and one single; and that it alone of all fish\n chews the cud. And that it delights in seaweed for food, on which account the\n fishermen use seaweed as a bait to catch it with. And it is in season in the\n summer. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n We fish for spari, and for scari too, \n Whose very dung may not be thrown away. \n But Seleucus of Tarsus, in his treatise on Fishing, says that the scarus\n is the only fish which never sleeps; by reason of which it is not easily caught,\n even by night. But this may be the case on account of its timid nature. And\n Archestratus says, in his Gastronomy,\u2014 \n Seek now a scarus, fresh from Ephesus, \n And in the winter season eat a mullet \n Caught in the waves of sandy Teichioussa, \n A village of Miletus, near the Carians, \n The crooked-footed Carians. \n And in another part he says\u2014 \n Wash and then roast the mighty scarus which \n Comes from the sea that laves Chalcedon's walls: \n That too is good which near Byzantium swims, \n With back as broad as a large oval shield. \n Take him and cook him whole as I shall tell you. \n Sprinkle him o'er with oil and grated cheese, \n Then place him in the oven hanging up, \n So as to escape the bottom, and then roast him, \n And sprinkle him with salt and cummin seed \n Well mix'd together; and again with oil, \n Pouring out of your hand the holy stream. \n Nicander of Thyatira says that there are two kids of scari; and that one\n is called the onias, and the other the \u00e6lous. \n \n ","113":"\n Then there is the sparus. Icesius says that this is a more juicy fish than the\n sprat, and more nutritious than most other fish. And Epicharmus says, in his\n Hebe's Wedding,\u2014 \n Neptune then arives himself \n Laden with most beauteous nets \n In the boats of fair Ph\u0153nicia, \n Then we all do spari catch, \n And scari too, that sacred fish, \n Whose very dung may not be thrown away. \n And Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing,\u2014 \n The sparus or the hycas fond of company. \n And Dorion mentions this fish, in his treatise on Fishes. \n ","114":"\n There is also the scorpion. Diodes, in the first book of his treatise on Wholesome\n Things, addressed to Plistarchus, says\u2014 Of fresh fish, the following have\n drier meat: the scorpions, the sea-cuckoo, the sea-sparrow, the sargi, and the\n rough-tail. But the mullet is not so dry as these are; for all fish which keep\n near the rocks have softer flesh. And Icesius says\u2014 There are two\n kinds of scorpion; one of which lives in the sea, and the other in marshes. And\n the one which lives in the sea is red, but the other is rather black. But the\n sea-mullet is superior to the other, both in taste and in nutritious qualities.\n But the scorpions have purging qualities, are easy of secretion, very juicy,\n and very nutritious; for they are a cartilaginous fish. The scorpion\n brings forth its young twice a-year, as Aristotle tells us, in the fifth book of\n his Parts of Animals. But Numenius says, in his treatise on Fishing,\u2014 \n The phycides, the alphestes, and besides \n The red-flesh'd scorpion, and the black-tail quick, \n Which guides the perch all through the stormy sea. \n But that he is a fish which has the power of stinging, Aristotle tells\n us, in his book about Fishes or Animals. And Epicharmus, in his Muses, says that\n the scorpion is a variegated fish:\u2014 \n The variegated scorpion, the grayling, \n The fat and well-fed lizards. \n The scorpion is a solitary fish, and feeds on seaweed. But, in the fifth\n book of his Parts of Animals, Aristotle speaks of scorpions and scorpides in\n different places; but it is uncertain whether he means the same fish; because we\n ourselves have often eaten the scorp\u00e6na and the scorpion, and there is no one who does not know that both their juice and their meat are\n quite different. But Archestratus, that skilful cook, in his Golden Words, tells\n us\u2014 \n When you're at Thasos buy a scorpion, \n But let him not be longer than one cubit; \n Avoid the larger sizes. \n \n \n ","115":"\n Then there is the scombrus, or tunny, which is mentioned by this name by\n Aristophanes, in his Gerytades. Icesius says that that species of tunny called\n scombrus is smaller in size, but more nutritious, than the species called colias;\n and also more juicy, though not more easily digested. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's\n Wedding, mentions them thus:\u2014 \n Sea-swallows, and mormyri, both of which \n Are larger than the coli\u00e6 and the scombri, \n But less than those whose name is thynnides. \n \n \n ","116":"\n The sargus is another fish. He (as Icesius tells us) is a fish of very exciting\n and astringent properties, and more nutritious than the melanurus, or blacktail.\n But Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, says that the sargus is a very cunning\n fish as respects the catching him:\u2014 \n The rich sea-blackbird, or the thrush who sports \n Beneath the waves; the sargus too who rushes \n Now here with sudden movement, and now there, \n The greatest enemy to the fisher's nets. \n And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals,\n says that the sargus brings forth its young twice in the year; once in the spring\n and once in the autumn. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n The sargus, and the chalcis, and the . . . \n But he speaks of the sarginus, or sargus, as an excellent fish, in the\n following lines\u2014 \n There the sarginus was, the melanurus, \n And the dear t\u00e6nia, thin but delicious. \n And in a similar manner Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, speaks,\n calling them sargini and chalcides, on this very account. But the wise\n Archestratus says\u2014 \n Now when the bright Orion's star doth set, \n And the fair mother of the vinous grape \n Doth shed her hair, then take a roasted sargus, \n Well sprinkled o'er with cheese, of mighty size, \n Smoking, and soften'd with sharp vinegar. \n For he is hard by nature. And remember \n This is the way all hard fish should be cook'd. \n \n But those whose meat is good and soft by nature, \n It is enough to sprinkle well with salt, \n And lightly to anoint with oil. For they \n Have virtue and delights within themselves. \n \n \n ","117":"\n There is the salpe, too. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n The aon, and the phagrus, and the pike, \n And the dung-eating, bloated, dirty salpe, \n Which still have a sweet flavour in the summer. \n And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that the\n salpe has young once a-year only, in the autumn; and that his skin is covered with\n numerous red lines. Moreover, he has serrated teeth, and is a solitary fish. And\n he says that it is stated by the fishermen that he may be caught with a cucumber,\n being very fond of that kind of food. And Archestratus says\u2014 \n I always do account the fish call'd salpe \n A worthless fish. But it is least tasteless \n When the wheat ripens. And the choicest kinds \n Are caught at Mitylene. \n And Pancrates, in his Works of the Sea, says\u2014 \n There is the salpe too, of the same size, \n Which the seafaring fishermen do call \n The ox, because he grinds within his teeth \n The stout seaweed with which he fills his belly. \n He also is a spotted or variegated fish; on which account his friends\n used to nickname Mnaseas the Locrian (or, as some call him, the Colophonian),\u2014the\n man who wrote the poem called The Sports,\u2014Salpe, on account of the variety of\n things in his collection. But Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his Voyage round Asia,\n says that it was a Lesbian woman, named Salpe, who wrote the book called The\n Sports. But Alcimus, in his Affairs of Sicily, says that in Messene, in Sicily,\n there was a man named Botrys, who was the author of some Sports \n very like those which are attributed to Salpe. But Archippus uses the word in the\n masculine form, Salpes, saying\u2014 \n The ceryx shouted out, \n The salpes trumpeted and fetch'd seven obols. \n And there is a similar fish produced in the Red Sea, which is called the\n stromateus; and it has gold-coloured lines running along the whole of his body, as\n Philo tells us, in his book on Mines. \n \n ","118":"\n There is also the synodon and the synagris. They also are mentioned by Epicharmus,\n when he says\u2014 \n Synagrides, and mazi, and the synodons, \n With red spots variegated. \n And Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, writes the word with an\n \u03c5, \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2; and says\u2014 \n Then the white synodon, and boax, and triccus. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Fish with these baits then, if you wish to eat \n The mighty synodon, or diving horsetail. \n But Dorion writes the word \u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, with\n an \u03b9; and so does Archestratus, in the following\n lines:\u2014 \n But try to catch a well-fed sinodon, \n And you will find the best in narrow straits. \n All this advice to Cyrus I have given, \n And now to you, Cle\u00e6nus, I impart it. \n And Antiphanes says, in his Archistrata,\u2014 \n But who would eat an eel, or sinodon's head. \n \n \n ","119":"\n There is also the saurus, or lizard. Alexis mentions this fish, in his Leuce. It\n is a cook who is speaking:\u2014 \n \n A. Do you know how you ought to dress a lizard? \n \n B. I shall, when you have taught me. \n \n A. First of all \n Take off the gills, then wash him, then cut off \n The spines all round, and split him open neatly; \n Then when you've laid him flat, anoint him well \n And thoroughly with assaf\u0153etida; \n Sprinkle him then with cheese, and salt, and marjoram. \n And Ephippus, in his Cydon, gives a list of many other fishes, and among\n them he mentions the lizard, in the following lines:\u2014 \n Slices of tunny, and of glanis, \n Of shark, and rhine, and of conger, \n Cephalus, perch, and lizard too, \n And phycis, brinchus, also mullet, \n Sea-cuckoo, phagrus, myllus, sparus, \n Lebias, \u00e6olias, and sea-swallow, \n Thritta, and squid, and cuttle-fish, \n Sea-sparrow, and drac\u00e6nides. \n The polypus, the squid, and orphus, \n The tench, th' anchovy, and the cestres, \n And last of all the needle-fish. \n And Innesimachus, in his Horse-breeder, says\u2014 \n Of fish with teeth serrated, you may eat \n The grim torpedo, the sea-frog, the perch, \n The lizard, and the trichias, and the phycis, \n The brinchus, and the mullet, and sea-cuckoo. \n \n There is also the scepinus; and this fish is mentioned by\n Dorion, in his treatise on Fish; and he says that it is also called the\n attageinus, or sea-woodcock. \n ","120":"\n There is also the sci\u00e6na. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n Aeoli\u00e6 were there, and plotes too, \n And cynoglossi and sciathides. \n But Numenius calls this fish the Sciadeus, saying\u2014 \n Use then this bait, and you perhaps may catch, \n If such your wish, a mighty synodon, \n Or the quick leaping hippurus, or the phagrus \n Proud with his high-raised crest, or in a shoal \n Of trusty comrades, the fresh sciadeus. \n There is also the syagris; and this fish is mentioned by Epicharmus, in\n his Hebe's Wedding, and also in his Earth and Sea. \n ","121":"\n Then there is the sphur\u00e6na, or hammer-fish; and these fish, Icesius says, are more\n nutritious than the congers, but very unpleasant and unpalatable to the taste;\n and, as to their juicy qualities, they are tolerable. But Dorion says\u2014 The\n sphur\u00e6na, which they call the cestra. And Epicharmus, in his Muses,\n having named the cestra, does not after that mention the sphur\u00e6na, thinking them\n the same fish\u2014 \n The chalcides, the sea-dog, and the cestra, \n And perch with variegated back. \n And Sophron, in his Male Farces, says\u2014 The cestr\u00e6, which cat the\n botis. But Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things\n which resemble one another, puts down the cestra, the needle-fish, and the\n sea-lizard as very nearly like one another. And the Attic writers in general call\n the sphur\u00e6na the cestra, and do not so often use the name of sphur\u00e6na.\n Accordingly, Strattis, in his Macedonians, when some Athenian asks the question,\n as being ignorant of the name, and saying, \n But what is the sphur\u00e6na? \n The other replies, \n You, O Athenians, do call it the cestra. \n And Antiphanes, in his Euthydicus, says\u2014 \n \n A. The sphur\u00e6na is a common fish. \n \n B. You should say cestra, in strict Attic Greek. \n And Nicophon, in his Pandora, says\u2014 \n The cestra and the pike. \n \n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n The cestra and the variegated perch. \n \n \n ","122":"\n The cuttle-fish is often mentioned. Aristophanes says, in his Danaides,\u2014 \n And when I have the cuttle-fish and polypus. \n And the penultima of this word has the acute accent like that in the word\n \u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, as Philemon tells us; like these words,\n \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03af\u03b1. But Aristotle says that\n the cuttle-fish has eight feet, of which the two lowest are the largest; and that\n it has two proboscises, and between them it has its eyes and mouth placed. And it\n has two teeth, one above and one below; and what is called a shell on its back.\n And the ink is contained in what is called the mutis, which answers to the liver;\n and it lies near its mouth, being something like a bladder. Its belly is wide and\n smooth, like the paunch of an ox. And the little cuttle-fish feed on small fish,\n extending their proboscises like fishermen's lines, and catching their prey with\n them. It is said, too, that when a storm comes, they seize hold of the rocks with\n their proboscises, as if they were anchors, and so fix themselves firm. And when\n the cuttle-fish is pursued, it discharges its ink, and is hidden in it, making it\n appear as if it were flying forwards. And it is also said, that when the female is\n struck by a harpoon, the male fish come to its assistance, dragging it on; but if\n the male fish be taken, the female fish flees away. But the cuttlefish does not\n live more than a year, as neither does the polypus. But, in the fifth book of his\n Parts of Animals, Aristotle says\u2014 The cuttle-fish and the squids swim\n together, being united together at the mouths, and also touching one another\n with their feelers, so as to join in that manner; and they also join proboscis\n to proboscis. But of all the molluscous fish, the cuttle-fish is the earliest\n in the spring to bring forth its young; and they do not bring forth at every\n season. But they go with young fifteen days; and when they lay their eggs, the\n male follows the female, and breathes upon the eggs and makes them firm. And\n they move in pairs; and the male is more variegated than the female, and\n blacker on the back. \n \n ","123":"\n And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n The polypus, likewise the cuttle-fish, \n And the swift-moving squid. \n \n \n And we must also take notice of this, with reference to Speu- \n sippus, who says that the cuttle-fish and the squid are the same fish. But when\n Hipponax, in his Iambics, uses the words \u03c3\u03b7\u03c0\u03af\u03b7\u03c2\n \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, the interpreters have explained the expression as meaning\n the ink of the cuttle-fish. But the word \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 is, properly speaking, equivalent to \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1, a dish compounded of various ingredients, as Erasistratus\n tells us, in his Cookery Book. And he writes as follows\u2014 But \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 is made with roast meat and blood stirred\n up and compounded with cheese, and salt, and cummin, and assaf\u0153tida; but the\n meat may also be boiled. And Glaucus the Locrian, in his Cookery Book,\n writes as follows\u2014 \n \u02bd\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 is blood boiled, and assaf\u0153tida, and\n boiled lees of wine; or sometimes honey and vinegar, and milk and cheese, and\n sweet-smelling herbs are shred and mixed together in it. And\n Archestratus, that man of the most varied learning, says\u2014 \n The cuttle-fish of Abdera and the middle of Maronea. \n And Aristophanes, in his Thesmophoriazuss, says\u2014 \n Has any fish or cuttle-fish been bought? \n And in the Danaides he says\u2014 \n Osmulia, m\u0153nidea, and cuttle-fish. \n Theopompus, in his Aphrodite, says\u2014 \n . . . But eat, my friend, \n This cuttle-fish, and this small polypus. \n But concerning the boiling of the small polypus, Alexis, in his Wicked\n Woman, introduces a cook speaking as follows\u2014 \n Now these three cuttle-fish I have just bought \n For one small drachma. And when I 've cut off \n Their feelers and their fins, I then shall boil them. \n And cutting up the main part of their meat \n Into small dice, and rubbing in some salt, \n After the guests already are sat down, \n I then shall put them in the frying-pan, \n And serve up hot towards the end of supper. \n \n \n ","124":"\n The next fish is the mullet; and \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7 is like\n \u03ba\u03af\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7, ending in \u03b7. For the feminine nouns which end in \u03bb\u03b1 require another \u03bb before the\n \u03bb\u03b1; ; as \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1,\n \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1. But all the words which have \u03b3 united to \u03bb end in \u03b7; as \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7, \u03b1\u1f34\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7, \n \u03b6\u03b5\u03cd\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his\n Parts of Animals, says that the mullet brings forth three times in the year; and\n states that the fishermen have adopted this opinion from the spawn being seen\n three times a-year in certain localities. And perhaps it is from the word \u03c4\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 (three times) that it has its name; just as the\n fish called \u1f00\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 has its name \n from its being a fish which does not go about by itself, but in shoals ( \u1f05\u03bc\u03b1 ). And the \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is\n so called from \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03c9 (to leap); as also is the\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c2. And the \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03b7 is so named as being \u1f00\u03c6\u03c5\u1f74\u03c2, \n which is equivalent to \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u1f74\u03c2, that is to say,\n slowly propagated. Then \u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 has its name from\n \u03b8\u03cd\u03c9 (to rush), because it is an impetuous fish,\n from being driven about by its fly in the head at the time of the rising of the\n Dog-star. But it is a fish with serrated teeth, gregarious, and spotted all over,\n and also carnivorous: and when it has had young three times it becomes barren; for\n some little worms are engendered in its womb, which devour the young as soon as\n they are conceived. And from the actual facts, Epicharmus calls them hump-backed,\n in his Hebe's Wedding, where he says\u2014 \n He brought the hump-back'd mullet too, \n And the ungrateful b\u00e6ones. \n But Sophron, in his Male Farces, speaks of a fish which he calls \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7, saying, \n The trigola which cuts the navel string. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n The trigola which loves calm weather. \n And in his play called P\u00e6dica he says\u2014 \n . . . trigola . . . . \n But, in his Affairs of Women, he says\u2014 \n The bearded mullet ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7 ). \n But Diocles, in his books addressed to Plistarchus, says that the mullet\n is a fish of hard flesh; and Speusippus says that the sea-cuckoo, the sea-swallow,\n and the mullet are all alike; on which account Tryphon says, in his treatise on\n Animals, that some people think that the trigola is the sea-cuckoo, from its\n likeness to it, and from the dryness of its hindquarters; which Sophron indicates,\n when he says\u2014 \n The fat mullets and the hinder parts of the trigola. \n \n \n ","125":"\n But Plato, in his Phaon, says\u2014 \n The mullet is not wholesome for the nerves, \n For it is sacred to the chaste Diana, \n And all excitement hates. \n But the mullet is attributed to Hecate as her fish, on account of the\n common derivation of their names; for Hecate is called \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b4\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, as presiding over places where three roads met, and\n \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, as having three eyes; and also they\n provide her a banquet on the thirtieth day of each month ( \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9 ). And, on similar principles,\n they assign to Apollo the fish \u03ba\u03af\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, from\n \u03ba\u03b9\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 (the harp); and the \u03b2\u03cc\u03b1\u03be to Mercury, from \u03b2\u03bf\u03ac\u03c9 (to speak); and the \u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 to\n Bacchus, from \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u1f78\u03c2 (ivy); and the \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 to Venus, as Aristophanes in his Birds says,\n from the similarity of its name to the word \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2. And so the bird called the \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (or duck), they call Neptune's bird; and the sea production\n which we call \u1f00\u03c6\u03c5\u1f70, and others \u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b1, and which is more generally called \u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 (foam), they also give to him; though they say\n that this also is very dear to Venus, because she herself was born of foam. But\n Apollodorus, in his books concerning the Gods, says that the mullet is sacrificed\n to Hecate on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is\n \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, of a triple form. But Melanthus, in\n his treatise on the Eleusinian Mysteries, says that both the \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b7 and the \u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 (or sprat),\n are sacred to Hecate, because Hecate is also a goddess of the sea. But Hegesander\n the Delphian says that the mullet is accustomed to be carried about in the\n Artemisia, because it is accustomed diligently to hunt out and destroy the\n sea-hares, which are poisonous animals; on which account, as it does this to the\n great benefit of mankind, the mullet as a huntress is considered sacred to the\n goddess who is also a huntress. And Sophron has called the mullet\n bearded, because those which have beards are better flavoured\n than those which have not. And there is a place at Athens called \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1, and there there is a shrine to \u02bd\u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03af\u03bd\u03b7; on which account Chariclides, in his\n Chain, says\u2014 \n O mistress Hecate, Trioditis, \n With three forms ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b5 ) and three faces\n ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5 ), \n Propitiated with mullets ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 ). \n \n \n ","126":"\n And if the mullet, while alive, be choked with wine, and then a man drinks the\n wine, he will no longer be able to indulge in the pleasures of Venus, as\n Terpsicles tells us in his book on Amatory Pleasures. And if a woman drinks this\n same wine, she never becomes pregnant. Birds, too, are affected in the same\n manner. But Archestratus, that very learned man, after he has praised the Milesian\n mullet which are found at Teichius, proceeds to say\u2014 \n If you at Thasos are, then buy a mullet; \n You ne'er will get a worse, unless indeed \n You go to Tius; but even those are fair: \n But at Erythr\u00e6 they are caught in shore \n And are most excellent. \n \n And Cratinus, in his Trophonius, says\u2014 \n And do not eat a red-flesh'd mullet hard, \n Brought from Aexona; nor of any turtle, \n Or mighty melanurus from those seas. \n But Nausicrates, the comic poet, praises the mullets from Aexona, in his\n Captains of Ships, saying\u2014 \n Those yellow fleshed fish, which the high wave \n That beats Aexona brings towards the shore, \n The best of fish; with which we venerate \n The light-bestowing daughter of great Jove; \n When sailors offer gifts of feasts to heaven. \n \n B. You mean the mullet. \n \n \n ","127":"\n There is, too, the t\u00e6nia; and this is mentioned by Epicharmus:\u2014 \n The most belov\u00e8d t\u00e6nia, which are thin, \n But highly flavour'd, and need little fire. \n And Mith\u00e6cus, in his Cookery Book, says\u2014 Having taken out the\n entrails of the t\u00e6nia, and cut off its head, and washed it, and having cut it\n into slices, sprinkle over it cheese and oil. But this fish is found in\n the greatest number and in the finest condition off Canopus, which is near\n Alexandria; and also off Seleucia, which is close to Antioch. But when Eupolis, in\n his Prospaltii, says\u2014 \n His mother was a Thracian woman, \n A seller of t\u00e6nie; \n he then means by the word \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, not the\n fish, but those pieces of woven work and girdles with which women bind their\n waists. \n ","128":"\n Another fish is the trachurus, or rough-tail. Diodes mentions this as a dry fish.\n And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n The aconia and the wagtail too, \n And the . . . trachurus. \n \n \n There is also the taulopias. Concerning this fish, A chestratus says\u2014 \n When it is summer buy a good-sized head \n Of fresh taulopias, just when Phaethon \n Is driving his last course. Dress it with speed. \n Serve it up hot, and some good seasoning with it, \n Then take its entrails, spit and roast them too. \n \n \n ","129":"\n There is also the \u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u1f76\u03c2, [which is a kind of\n cuttle-fish, different from the \u03c3\u03b7\u03c0\u03af\u03bf.] Aristotle\n says that this also is a gregarious fish, and that it has a\n great many things in com- mon with the sepia; such as the same number of feet, and\n the two proboscises: but of this kind the lower feet are the smaller, and the\n upper feet the larger; and of the proboscises, that on the right side is the\n thickest: and the whole body is delicate, and of a more oblong shape than the\n sepia. And the teuthis also has ink in its mutis, which, however, is not black,\n but of a pale colour. And its shell is very small, and cartilaginous. \n There is also the teuthus; and the only difference between the teuthus and the\n teuthis is in size: and the teuthus is of the size of three spans; and it is of a\n reddish colour. And of its two teeth, the lower one is the smallest, and the upper\n one is the largest; and both of them are black, and like a hawk's beak. And when\n it is slit open, it has a paunch like a pig's paunch. Aristotle, in the fifth book\n of his Parts of Animals, says that both the teuthus and the sepia are short-lived\n fish. And Archestratus, who travelled and sailed over the whole earth, for the\n sake of gratifying his greedy appetite, says,\u2014 \n The best of all the teuthides are those \n Caught near Pierian Dium, near the stream \n Of Baphyras. And in Ambracia's port \n You will see mighty shoals of this same fish. \n And Alexis, in his Eretrian, introduces a cook speaking in this way\u2014\n \n Teuthides, thornbacks, rays, and fat \n Anchovies, lumps of meat, and paunches too. \n I took the teuthides, cut off their fins, \n Adding a little fat; I then did sprinkle \n Some thin shred herbs o'er all for seasoning. \n There is also a sort of cake or confectionary called \u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u1f76\u03c2, which is mentioned by Iatrocles, in his book on\n the Art of making Bread, as Pamphilus quotes. \n ","130":"\n Then there is the sea-pig. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n There were hy\u00e6nides, buglossi, \n There was the harp-fish too in numbers. \n And he also calls them not only \u1f51\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n but also \u1f55\u03b5\u03c2 in the following lines\u2014 \n There were too chalcides and sea-pigs ( \u1f55\u03b5\u03c2 ), \n And sea-hawks, and the fat sea-dog. \n \n Unless, indeed, when he uses the word \u1f57\u03c2 here, he means the same animal which is also called \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, the sea-boa. But Numenius, in his Art of\n Fishing, enumerates plainly enough some sort of \u1f55\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 or plaice, when he says\u2014 \n The cantharis, hy\u00e6na, and the mullet. \n And Dionysius, in his Cookery Book, also speaks of the hy\u00e6na or plaice.\n And Archestratus, that prince of cooks and epicures says,\u2014 \n At Aenus or at Potus buy the sea-pig, \n Which some men call the digger of the sand, \n Then boil his head, adding no seasoning, \n But only water, stirring it full often, \n And add some pounded hyssop; if you want \n Anything more, pour on some pungent vinegar; \n Steep it in that, then eat it with such haste \n As if your object were to choke yourself. \n But roast its neck, and all its other parts. \n And perhaps it is the sea-pig which Numenius, in his Art of Fishing,\n calls the psamathis, or sand-fish, when he says\u2014 \n Sometimes the fierce carcharias, and sometimes \n The psamathis, delighting in the surf. \n \n \n ","131":"\n Then there is the hyces. Callimachus, in his epigrams, calls the hyces the sacred\n fish, in these lines\u2014 \n And he does deem the sacred hyces god. \n And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n The spar, or the gregarious hyces; \n Or phagrus, ever wand'ring near the rocks. \n And Tim\u00e6us, in the thirteenth book of his Histories, speaking of the town\n in Sicily, (I mean the town of Hyccara,) says that this town derived its name from\n the circumstance of the first man who arrived at the place finding abundance of\n the fish called hyces, and those too in a breeding condition; and they, taking\n this for an omen, called the place Hyccarus. But Zenodotus says that the Cyren\u00e6ans\n call the hyces the erythrinus. But Hermippus of Smyrna, in his essay on Hipponax,\n when he speaks of the hyces, means the iulis; and says that it is very hard to\n catch; on which account Philetas says\u2014 \n Nor was the hyces the last fish who fled. \n \n \n ","132":"\n There is also the phagrus. Speusippus, in the second book of his Things resembling\n one another, says that the phagrus, the erythrinus, and the hepatus, are very much\n alike. And Numenius also has mentioned it in the lines\n which have been quoted not long ago. But Aristotle says that he is a carnivorous\n and solitary fish; and that he has a heart of a triangular shape, and that he is\n in season in the spring. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, speaks of the\n \n Aones, and the phagri, and the pikes. \n And Metagenes also mentions them in his Thurio-Pers\u00e6. And Ameipsias says\n in his Connus\u2014 \n A food for orphi and selachia, \n And for the greedy phagri. \n And Icesius says\u2014 The phagrus, and the chromis, and the anthias,\n and the acharnanes, and the orphi, and the synodons, and the synagrides, are\n all very nearly akin to one another; for they are sweet and astringent, and\n nutritious, but in the same proportion they are hard of digestion. And those of\n them which are fleshy, and which are caught nearer land, are the most\n nutritious, and those also which have the least fat. But Archestratus\n says\u2014 \n 'Tis when the dogstar rises in the sky \n That you should eat the phagrus; specially \n If you in Delos or Eretria are, \n Or other favouring harbours of the sea; \n But, if you can, purchase his head alone, \n And tail; and bring no more within your doors. \n Strattis also mentions the phagrus in his Lemnomeda\u2014 \n Eating a number of large phagri. \n And in his Philoctetes he says\u2014 \n Then, going to the market, they will buy \n A great abundance of large phagri, and \n Slices of tender round Copaic eel. \n There is also a kind of stone called the phagrus. For the whetstone is\n called so among the Cretans, as Simmias testifies. \n ","133":"\n There is also the channa. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014 \n The channa, with large mouth, and then the cod, \n With deep and spacious belly. \n Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n The channas and the eel, and pitinus, \n Who only roams by night. \n Dorion also mentions him in his treatise on Fishes. But Aristotle, in his\n book on Animals, calls the channa a fish variegated with red\n and black; and he calls it also \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \n because it is marked with black lines. \n ","134":"\n There is the chromis; this also is spoken of by Epicharmus, who says\u2014 \n There is the sword-fish and the chromias, \n Who, in the spring, as Ananius says, \n Is of all fish the daintiest. \n And Numenius, in his Art of Fishing, says\u2014 \n The hyces, or the beautiful callicthys, \n Or else the chromis, and sometimes the orphus. \n And Archestratus says\u2014 \n You may catch noble chromises in Pella, \n And they are fat when it is midsummer; \n And in Ambracia likewise they abound. \n \n \n ","135":"\n There is also the chrysophrys. Archippus says in his Fishes\u2014 \n The chrysophrys, sacred to Cytherean Venus. \n And Icesius says that these fish are the best of all fish in sweetness,\n and also in delicacy of flavour in other respects. They are also most nutritious.\n They produce their young, as Aristotle says, in a manner similar to the cestres,\n wherever there are flowing rivers. Epicharmus mentions them in his Muses; and\n Dorion also, in his book on Fishes. And Eupolis, in his Flatterers, says\u2014 \n I spent a hundred drachmas upon fish, \n And only got eight pike, and twelve chrysophryes. \n But the wise Archestratus, in his Suggestions, says\u2014 \n Pass not the chrysophrys from Ephesus \n Unheeded by; which the Ephesians call \n The ioniscus. Take him eagerly, \n The produce of the venerable Selinus; \n Wash him, and roast him whole, and serve him up, \n Though he be ten full cubits long. \n \n \n ","136":"\n There is a fish, too, called the chalcis; and others which resemble it, namely,\n the thrissa, the trichis, and the eritimus. Icesius says, the fish called the\n chalcis, ad the sea-goat, and the needle-fish, and the thrissa, are like chaff\n destitute alike of fat and of juice. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says\u2014\n \n The chalcides, the sea-pig too, \n The sea-hawk, and the fat sea-dog. \n But Dorion calls it the chalcidice. And Numenius says,\u2014 \n But you would thus harpoon, in the same way, \n That chalcis and the little tiny sprat. \n \n But the \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 is different\n from the \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u1f76\u03c2; and the \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 is mentioned by Heraclides, in his Cookery Book; and by\n Euthydemus, in his book on Cured Fish, who says that they are bred in the country\n of the Cyzicenes, being a round and circular fish. \n But the thrissa is mentioned by Aristotle in his book on Animals and Fishes, in\n these words\u2014 The following are stationary fish: the thrissa, the\n encrasicholus, the membras anchovy, the coracinus, the erythrinus, and the\n trichis. And Eupolis mentions the trichis in his Flatterers;\u2014 \n He was a stingy man, who once in his life \n Before the war did buy some trichides; \n But in the Samian war, a ha'p'orth of meat. \n And Aristophanes, in his Knights, says\u2014 \n If trichides were to be a penny a hundred. \n But Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, speaks also of the river Thrissa;\n and calls the trichis trichias. Nicochares, in his Lemnian Women, says\u2014 \n The trichias, and the premas tunny too, \n Placed in enormous quantities for supper. \n (But there was a kind of tunny which they used to call premnas. Plato, in\n his Europa, has these lines\u2014 \n He once, when fishing, saw one of such size \n A man could scarcely carry it, in a shoal \n Of premnades, and then he let it go, \n Because it was a boax.) \n And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, calls it a\n trichias also, but in the book which is entitled \u03b6\u03c9\u03ca\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd, he calls it trichis. And it is said that this fish is\n delighted with dancing and singing, and that when it hears music it leaps up out\n of the sea. \n Dorion also mentions the eritimi, saying, that they are much the same as the\n chalcides, and that they are very nice in forced meat. And Ep\u00e6netus, in his book\n upon Fishes, says\u2014 The sea-weasel; the smaris, which some call the dog'sbed;\n the chalcides, which they also call sardini; the eritimi, the sea-hawk, and the\n sea-swallow. And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals,\n calls them sardines. And Callimachus, in his Names used by different Nations,\n writes thus\u2014 The encrasicholus, the eritimus, are names used by the\n Chalcedonians; the trichidia, the chalcis, the ictar, the \n atherina. And in another part, giving a list of the names of fishes, he\n says\u2014 The oz\u00e6na, the osmylnion, are names used by the Thurians; the\n iopes, the eritimi, are names used by the Athenians. And Nicander\n mentions the iopes in his B\u0153otian,\u2014 \n But as when round a shoal of newly born \n lopes, phagri, or fierce scopes roam, \n Or the large orphus. \n And Aristophanes, in his Ships of Burden, says\u2014 \n O wretched fish, the first of trichides \n To be immersed in pickle. \n For they used to steep in pickle all the fish which were proper to be\n dressed on the coals. And they called pickle, Thasian brine; as also the same poet\n says in his Wasps,\u2014 \n For before that it twice drank in the brine. \n \n \n ","137":"\n There is also a fish called the thratta. And since we have brought the discussion\n to this point, and have also discussed the thrissa; let us now examine what the\n thratta are, which are mentioned by Archippus, in his play called the Fishes. For\n in that play, in the treaty between the Fishes and the Athenians, he introduces\n the following sentences\u2014 \n And it is agreed on further \n That both the high contracting parties \n Shall restore all they now do hold \n Of each other's property. \n We shall give up thus the Thratt\u00e6, \n And the flute-playing Atherina, \n And Thyrsus's daughter Sepia, \n And the mullet, and Euclides, \n Who was archon t'other day, \n And the coraciontes too, \n Who from Anagyrus come; \n And the offspring of the tench, \n Who swims round sacred Salamis; \n And the frog who's seated near, \n From the marshes of Oreum. \n Now in these lines, perhaps a man may ask what sort of thratt\u00e6 among the\n fishes are meant here, which the fish agree to give up to the men. And since I\n have got some private things written out on this subject, I will now recite to you\n that portion of them which bears most on the subject. \n The thratta, then, is really a genuine sea-fish; and Mnesimachus, in his\n Horse-breeder, mentions it; and Mnesimachus is a poet of the middle comedy. And he\n speaks thus\u2014 \n \n The mullet, and the lebias, and the sparus, \n The bright \u00e6olias, and the thratta too, \n The sea-swallow, the cars, and the cuttlefish. \n But Dorotheus of Ascalon, in the hundred and eighth book of his\n collection of Words, writes this name \u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1, \n either because he fell in with a copy of the drama with an incorrect text, or\n because, as he himself was unused to the word, he altered it so before he\n published it. But the name thetta does absolutely never occur in any Attic writer\n whatever. But that they were used to call a sea-fish by the name of thratta, that\n Anaxandrides establishes, speaking in this manner in his play called Lycurgus,\u2014\n \n And sporting with the little coracini, \n With little perches, and the little thratt\u00e6. \n And Antiphanes says in his Etrurian\u2014 \n \n A. He is of the Hal\u00e6a borough. This is all \n That now is left me, to be abused unjustly. \n \n B. Why so? \n \n A. He will (you'll see) bestow on me \n Some thratta. or sea-sparrow, or some lamprey, \n Or some enormous other marine evil. \n \n \n ","138":"\n We come now to the sea-sparrow. Diodes enumerates this fish among the drier kinds.\n But Speusippus, in the second book of his Things resembling one another, says that\n the sea-sparrow and the buglossus and the t\u00e6nia are very much alike. But\n Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, writes\u2014 And in the\n same manner the greater number of the small fish have young once a year; such\n as those which are called chyti, which are surrounded by a net, namely, the\n chromis, the sea-sparrow, the tunny, the pelamys, the cestreus, the chalcis,\n and others of the same sort. And in his treatise on Animals he\n says\u2014 These fish are cartilaginous, the sea-cow, the turtle, the torpedo,\n the ray, the sea-frog, the buglossa, the sea-sparrow, the mussel. But\n Dorion, in his book on Fishes, says\u2014 But of flat fish there is the\n buglossus, the sea-sparrow, the escharus, which they also call the\n coris. The buglossi are mentioned also by Epicharmus in his Hebe's\n Wedding\u2014 \n Hy\u00e6nides, buglossi, and a citharus. \n And Lynceus the Samian, in his Letters, says that the finest sea-sparrows\n are procured near Eleusis, in Attica. And Archestratus says\u2014 \n \n Remember then to get a fine sea-sparrow, \n And a rough-skinn'd buglossus, near the port \n Of sacred Chalcis \n But the Romans call the sea-sparrow rhombus; which, how- ever, is a Greek\n name. And Nausicrates, in his Sea Captains, having first mentioned the\n sea-grayling, proceeds in this manner\u2014 \n \n A. Those yellow-fleshed fish, which the high\n wave \n That beats Aexona brings towards the shore, \n The best of fish; with which we venerate \n The light-bestowing daughter of great Jove; \n When sailors offer gifts of feasts to heaven. \n \n B. You mean the muller, with its milky colour, \n Which the Sicilian multitude calls rhombus. \n \n \n ","139":"\n So now, having given you, O Timocrates, the whole of the conversation which took\n place among the Deipnosophists on the subject of fish, we may conclude our book\n here; and unless you want some other kind of food, we will end by setting before\n you what Eubulus has said in his Laced\u00e6monians, or Leda;\u2014 \n Besides all this you now shall have \n A slice of tunny, a slice of pork, \n Some paunch of kid, some liver of goat, \n Some ram, the entrails of an ox, \n A lamb's head, and a kid's intestines; \n The belly of a hare, a pudding, \n Some tripe, black-puddings, and a sausage. \n Being sated, therefore, with all this, let us now take due care of our\n bodies, in order to be able to feed comfortably on what is coming next. \n "},"7":{"0":"\n POLYBIUS the Megalopolitan, speaking of the great happiness which exists in\n Lusitania (and that is a district of Iberia, which the Romans now call Spania), O\n most excellent. Timocrates, in the thirty-fourth book of his Histories, says that\n in that country, on account of the excellent temperature of the air, both animals\n and men are exceedingly prolific; and the fruits, too, in that country never\n degenerate. For there are roses there, and white violets, and asparagus,\n and other flowers and fruits like them, which last nine months in the year; and\n as for sea-fish, both in abundance, and in excellence, and in beauty, it is\n very superior to that produced in our seas. And a siclus (this is equal to a\n medimnus) of barley costs only a drachma; and one of wheat costs nine\n Alexandrian obols; and a measure of wine costs a drachma; and a moderate-sized\n kid costs an obol, and so does a hare. And of lambs, the price is three or four\n obols; and a fat pig, weighing a hundred min\u00e6, costs five drachm\u00e6; and a sheep\n costs two. And a talent weight of figs costs three obols; and a calf costs five\n drachm\u00e6, and a draught-ox ten. And the meat of wild animals is scarcely ever\n valued at any price at all but people throw that in to purchasers into the\n bargain, or as a present. But to us, whenever we sup with our excellent\n friend Laurentius, he makes Rome another Lusitania,\u2014filling us with every sort of\n good thing every day, receiving us in a most princely manner with the greatest\n liberality, while we bring nothing from home as our contribution, except our\n arguments. \n \n ","1":"\n Now, as a long discussion had taken place about fish, it was plain that Cynulcus\n was annoyed at it; and so the excel- lent Democritus, anticipating him, said\u2014But,\n O you men fish, as Archippus says, you have omitted (for I too must throw in a\n little contribution of my own) those which are called fossil fishes, which are\n produced at Heraclea, and near Tium, in Pontus, which is a colony of the\n Milesians, though Theophrastus gives us an account of them. And this very same\n philosopher has also told us about those that are congealed in ice the whole\n winter, so that they have no feeling whatever, and make not the slightest motion,\n until they are put into the saucepans and boiled. And these fish have this\n especial peculiarity, which also belongs in some degree to the fish which are\n called fossil fish in Paphlagonia. For it is said that ditches are dug in those\n places to an exceeding depth, where no overflow of rivers ever reaches, nor of any\n other waters whatever; and yet in those ditches there are found living fishes. \n ","2":"\n But Mnaseas of Patra, in his Periplus, says that the fish in the river Clitor are\n not dumb; though Aristotle has stated in writing that the only fishes which have\n any voice are the scarus and the river-hog. And Philostephanus, who was a Cyren\u00e6an\n by birth, and a friend of Callimachus, in his treatise on Extraordinary Rivers,\n says that in the river Aroanius, which flows through Pheneum, there are fish which\n sing like thrushes, and that they are called the poicili\u00e6. And Nympho- dorus the\n Syracusan, in his Voyages, says that there are pike in the river Helorus, and\n large eels, so tame that they take bread out of the hands of any who bring it to\n them. And I myself, and very likely many of you too, have seen cestres tamed to\n the hand in the fountain of Arethusa, near Chalcis; and eels, having silver and\n golden earrings, taking food from any one who offered it to them, and entrails\n from the victims, and fresh cheese. And Semus says, in the sixth book of his\n Delias\u2014 They say that a boy once dipped a ewer into the well, and brought\n water to some Athenians who were sacri- ficing at Delos, to wash their hands\n with; and he brought up, as it happened, some fish in the ewer along with the\n water: and that on this the soothsayers of the Delians told them that they\n should become the lords of the sea. \n \n ","3":"\n And Polybius, in the thirty-fourth book of his Histories, \n says that behind Pyrene, as far as the river Narbo, the whole country is a plain,\n through which the rivers Illiberis and Rhoscynus proceed, flowing through cities\n of the same name as themselves, which are inhabited by some of the Celt\u00e6; and in\n this plain he says that the above-mentioned fossil fish are also found. And he\n says that the soil of that lain is light, and that a great quantity of the herb\n agrostis grows in it; and that beneath it, as the soil is sandy for a depth of two\n or three cubits, the water flows, which wanders away from these rivers; and so the\n fish, too, leaving the rivers, and proceeding underground, in the course of these\n erratic underflowings, in quest of food (for they are exceedingly fond of the root\n of the agrostis), have caused the whole plain to be full of subterranean fish,\n which people catch when they dig up the plain. And among the\n Indians, says Theophrastus, there are fish which go forth out of\n the rivers over the land, and then, leaping back, return again to the water,\n just like frogs; being in appearance very like the fish which are called\n maxini. \n \n ","4":"\n But I am not ignorant of what Clearchus, the Peripatetic philosopher, has said\n about what he calls the exoccetus fish, or fish which comes out of the water to\n sleep, which he mentions in his work entitled A Treatise on Aquatic Animals. For\n he has said, (and I think that I recollect his exact words, which are as follows,)\n The exoccetus fish, which some people call Adonis, has derived its name\n from constantly taking his rest out of the water. He is rather of a red colour,\n and from his gills down to his tail he has on each side of his body one white\n stripe reaching the whole length of his body. And he is round, but not being\n broad, he is equal in size to the cestrinisci which are found near the shore;\n and they are as near as may be about eight fingers in length. Altogether he is\n very like the fish called the sea-goat, except that the latter has a black\n place under his stomach, which they call the beard of the goat. And the\n exoc\u0153tus is one of the fish which keeps near to the rocks, and spends his life\n in rocky places. When it is calm weather he springs up with the waves and lies\n on the rocks for a considerable time, sleeping on the dry land, and turning\n himself so as to bask in the sun: and then, when he has had sufficient rest, he\n rolls towards the water again, until the wave, taking him \n again, bears him with the reflux back into the sea. And when he is awake on the\n dry land then he is on his guard against those birds which are called\n pareudist\u00e6, such as the halcyon, the sandpiper, and the helorius, which is a\n bird like the rail. For these birds in calm weather feed on the dry land, and\n often attack the exoc\u0153tus; but when he sees them at a distance he flies,\n leaping and panting, until he dives beneath the water. \n \n ","5":"\n Moreover, Clearchus says this also more plainly than Philostephanus the Cyren\u00e6an,\n whom I have previously mentioned. There are some fish which, though they\n have no throats, can utter a sound. Such are those which are found near\n Cleitor, in Arcadia, in the river called Ladon. For they have a voice, and\n utter a very audible sound. And Nicolaus, of Damascus, in the hundred\n and fourth book of his History, says\u2014 In the country around Apamea, in\n Phrygia, at the time of the Mithridatic wars, there were some earthquakes,\n after which there appeared in that district some lakes which previously had no\n existence, and rivers, and other springs which had been opened by the\n earthquake. Many also which had previously existed disappeared. And such a\n quantity of additional water, which was brackish and of a seagreen colour,\n burst up in that district, though it is at a very great distance from the sea,\n that all the neighbouring country was filled with oysters and fish, and all\n other productions of the sea. I know also that it has very often rained\n fishes. At all events, Ph\u00e6nias, in the second book of his Eresian Magistrates,\n says that in the Chersonesus it once rained fish uninterruptedly for three days;\n and Phylarchus, in his fourth book, says that people had often seen it raining\n fish, and often also raining wheat, and that the same thing has happened with\n respect to frogs. At all events, Heraclides Lembus, in the twenty-first book of\n his History, says\u2014 In P\u00e6onia and Dardania it has, they say, before now\n rained frogs; and so great has been the number of these frogs that the houses\n and the roads have been full of them; and at first, for some days, the\n inhabitants, endeavouring to kill them, and shutting up their houses, endured\n the pest; but when they did no good, but found that all their vessels were\n filled with them, and the frogs were found to be boiled up and roasted with\n everything they ate, and when besides all this, they could not make use of any\n water, nor put their feet on the ground for the heaps of\n frogs that were everywhere, and were annoyed also by the smell of those that\n died, they fled the country. \n \n ","6":"\n I am aware, too, that Posidonius the Stoic males this statement about the\n abundance of the fish:\u2014 When Tryphon of Apamea, who seized upon the kingdom\n of Syria, was attacked by Sarpedon, the general of Demetrius, near the city of\n Ptolemais, and when Sarpedon, being defeated, retired into the inland parts of\n the country with his own troops, but the army of Tryphon, having been\n victorious in the battle, were marching along the shore, on a sudden, a wave of\n the sea, rising to a great height, came over the land, and overwhelmed them\n all, and destroyed them beneath the waters, and the retreating wave also left\n an immense heap of fish with the corpses. And Sarpedon and his army heating of\n what had happened, came up, and were delighted at the sight of the corpses of\n their enemies, and carried away an enormous quantity of fish, and made a\n sacrifice to Neptune who puts armies to flight, near the suburbs of the\n city. \n \n ","7":"\n Nor will I pass over in silence the men who prophesy from fish in Lycia,\n concerning whom Polycharmus speaks, in the second book of his Affairs of Lycia;\n writing in this manner:\u2014 For when they have come to the sea, at a place\n where there is on the shore a grove sacred to Apollo, and where there is an\n eddy on the sand, the persons who are consulting the oracle come, bringing with\n them two wooden spits, having each of them ten pieces of roast meat on them.\n And the priest sits down by the side of the grove in silence; but he who is\n consulting the oracle throws the spits into the eddy, and looks on to see what\n happens. And after he has put the spits in, then the eddy becomes full of salt\n water, and there comes up such an enormous quantity of fish of such a\n description that he is amazed at the sight, and is even, as it were, alarmed at\n the magnitude of it. And when the prophet enumerates the different species of\n fish, the person who is consulting the oracle in this manner receives the\n prophecy from the priest respecting the matters about which he has prayed for\n information. And there appear in the eddy orphi, and sea-grayling, and\n sometimes some sorts of whales, such as the phalkena, or pristis, and a great\n many other fish which are rarely seen, and strange to the sight. \n \n And Artemidorus, in the tenth book of his Geography, says\n that\u2014 It is said by the natives that a fountain springs up in that place\n of sweet water, to which it is owing that these eddies exist there; and that\n very large fish are produced in that eddying place. And those who are\n sacrificing throw to these fish the firstfruits of what they offer, piercing\n them through with wooden spits, being pieces of meat, roasted and boiled, and\n cakes of barley and loaves. And both the harbour and the place is called\n Dinus. \n \n \n ","8":"\n I know, too, that Phylarchus has spoken, somewhere or other, about large fish, and\n about fresh figs which were sent with them; saying that Patroclus, the general of\n Ptolemy, sent such a present to Antigonus the king, by way of a riddle, as the\n Scythians sent an enigmatical present to Darius, when he was invading their\n country. For they sent (as Herodotus relates) a bird, and an arrow, and a frog.\n But Patroclus (as Phylarchus tells us, in the third book of his Histories) sent\n the before-mentioned fishes and figs; and the king, at the time that they arrived,\n happened to be drinking with his friends, and when all the party were perplexed at\n the meaning of the gifts, Antigonus laughed, and said to his friends that he knew\n what was the meaning of the present; for, says he, Patroclus\n means that we must either be masters of the sea, or else be content to eat\n figs. \n \n ","9":"\n Nor am I unaware that all fishes are called by one generic name, camasenes, by\n Empedocles the natural philosopher, when he says\u2014 \n How could the mighty trees and sea-born camasenes . . . \n And the poet, too, who wrote the Cyprian poems (whether he was a Cyprian\n or a man of the name of Stasinus, or whatever else his name may have been,\n represents Nemesis as pursued by Jupiter, and metamorphosed into a fish, in the\n following lines:\u2014 \n And after them she brought forth Helen third, \n A marvel to all mortal men to see; \n Her then the fair-hair'd Nemesis did bear, \n Compell'd by Jove, the sovereign of the gods. \n She indeed fled, nor sought to share the love \n Of that great father, son of Saturn, Jove; \n For too great awe did overpower her mind: \n So Nemesis did flee o'er distant lands, \n And o'er the black and barren waves o' the sea; \n \n But Jove pursued her (and with eagerness \n His soul desired her). In vain she took \n The form of some large fish who bounds along, \n Borne on the vast high-crested roaring wave; \n Sometimes she fled along the ocean, where \n The earth's most distant boundaries extend; \n Sometimes she fled along the fertile land; \n And took all shapes of every animal \n Which the land bears, to flee from amorous Jove. \n \n \n ","10":"\n I know, also, what is related about the fish called apopyris, which is found in\n the lake Bolbe; concerning which Hegesander, in his Commentaries, speaks\n thus:\u2014 Around Apollonia of Chalcis two rivers flow, the Ammites and the\n Olynthiacus, and they both fall into the lake Bolbe. And on the river\n Olynthiacus there is a monument of Olynthus, the son of Hercules and Bolbe. And\n in the months Anthesterion and Elaphebolion, the natives say that Bolbe sends\n Apopyris to Olynthus; and that about this time a most enormous number of fish\n ascend out of the lake into the river Olynthiacus: and this is a shallow river,\n scarcely deep enough to wet a man's ankles; but for all that there does not the\n less come a great number of fish, so that all the people of the district get\n enough cured fish for their use for the year. And it is a wonderful fact that\n they never pass above the monument of Olynthus. They say, in explanation of\n this, that the people of Apollonia did formerly, in the month Elaphebolion,\n celebrate sacrifices to the dead, but that they do so now in the month\n Anthesterion; and that on this account this ascent is made by the fish in those\n months alone in which the natives are accustomed to pay honour to their\n national heroes. \n \n ","11":"\n And this is the state of the case, O men fish; for you, having collected together\n every kind of thing, have thrown us out to be food for fishes, instead of giving\n them as food for us,\u2014making such long speeches as not even Ichthys, the phi-\n losopher of Megara, nor Ichthyon (and this also is a proper name), who is\n mentioned by Teleclides in his Amphicytons would make to us. And, on your account,\n I will give this advice to the servant, as it is said in the Ant Men of Phere-\n crates:\u2014 \n Mind that you never, O Deucalion, \n (Even if I bid you,) set a fish before me. \n For in Delos, as we are told by Semus the Delian, in the second book of\n the Delias, when they sacrifice to Brizo,\u2014and she is a deity\n who prophesies to people asleep (for the ancients used \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 as synonymous with \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03b4\u03c9, to\n sleep, saying\u2014 \n Then sleeping ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ) there we waited\n for the dawn)\u2014 \n so, when the Delian women sacrifice to this deity, they bring her, as\n their offering, boats full of all kinds of good things, except fish; because they\n address prayers to her on every subject, and especially for the safety of their\n vessels. \n ","12":"\n But, my friends, though I admire Chrysippus, the leader of the sect of the Stoics,\n on many accounts, I also praise him especially for having always classed\n Archestratus, that man who is so famous for his treatise on Cookery, with\n Philenis, to whom that indelicate composition about Amatory Pleasures is\n attributed; which, however, Aeschrion, the iambic poet of Samos, says was written\n by Polycrates the sophist, and attributed to Phil\u00e6nis for the sake of calumniating\n her, when she was a most respectable woman. And the iambics, in which this is\n stated, run as follows:\u2014 \n I am Phil\u00e6nis, famous among men; \n And here I lie, o'erwhelm'd by long old age. \n Do not, O foolish sailor, pass this cape \n Laughing and scorning and reproaching me. \n For. now I swear by Jove, and by the gods \n Who reign below, I never lustful was, \n I never made myself a sport to man. \n But one Polycrates, of Attic race, \n A trashy chatterer, and a false accuser, \n Wrote what he wrote; I know not what it was. \n Therefore that admirable Chrysippus, in the fifth book of his treatise on\n Honour and Pleasure, says\u2014 The books, too, of Phil\u00e6nis, and the Gastronomy\n of Archestratus, and all the drugs calculated to provoke appetite or sensual\n desires, and also all the servants who are skilled in such motions and such\n figures, and whose occupation it is to attend to these things. And\n again he says \u2014 That they learn such things, and get hold of the books\n written on such subjects by Phil\u00e6nis and Archestratus, and by those who have\n written similar works. And in his seventh book he says\u2014 Just as\n it would not be advisable to study the writings of Phil\u00e6nis or the Gastronomy\n of Archestratus, as tending to make a person live better. \n \n ","13":"\n But you, who are constantly making mention of this Archestratus, have made this\n entertainment full of intem- perance; for what of all the things which could\n unduly excite men has this fine epic poet omitted?\u2014he, the\n only imitator of the life of Sardanapalus the son of Anacyndaraxes, who, Aristotle\n says, is made more obscure still by adding the name of his father; on whose tomb,\n Chrysippus says, the following inscription was engraved:\u2014 \n Knowing that you are mortal, feed your soul \n On banquets and delights; for in the grave \n There's no enjoyment left. I now am dust \n Who once was king of mighty Nineveh; \n The things which I did eat, the joys of love, \n The insolent thoughts with which my wealth did fill me, \n Are all I now have left; for all my power \n And all my happiness is gone for ever. \n This is the only prudent rule of life, \n I never shall forget it, let who will \n Hoard boundless treasures of uncounted gold. \n And the great poet has said of the Ph\u00e6acians\u2014 \n To dress, to dance, to sing, our sole delight, \n The feast or bath by day, and love by night. \n And another person, not unlike Sardanapalus in disposition, gives this\n advice and these rules to those who are deficient in wisdom:\u2014 \n I to all mortals now give this advice: \n Live for the day with pleasure; he who dies \n Is nought; an empty shade beneath the earth: \n Man lives but a short space, and therefore should, \n While life remains, enjoy himself. \n And Amphis the comic poet, in his Ialemus, says\u2014 \n The man who knows that he is but a mortal, \n And yet seeks not enjoyment while alive, \n Leaving all other cares, is but a fool \n In mine and all wise men's opinion, \n And most unhappy in his destiny. \n And, in his play entitled the Gyn\u00e6cocracy, he say nearly the same\u2014 \n Drink and play, our mortal life \n On earth can but a brief space last; \n Death alone will last for ever, \n When once our too brief term is past. \n And a man of the name of Bacchides, who lived on the same principles as\n Sardanapalus, after he was dead had the following inscription placed on his tomb:\u2014\n \n Eat, drink, indulge thy soul with all delights, \n This stone is all that now remains for Bacchides. \n \n \n \n ","14":"\n Alexis, in his Tutor of Intemperate Men\u2014(as Sotion the Alexandrian says, in his\n Commentary on the Silli of Timon; for I myself have never met with the play,\n though I have read more than eight hundred plays of what is called the Middle\n Comedy, and have made extracts from them, but still I have never fallen in with\n the Tutor of Intemperate Men, nor do I recollect having seen any mention of it in\n any regular list of such plays; for Callimachus has not inserted it in his\n catalogue, nor has Aristophanes, nor even those scholars at Pergamus, who have\n handed down to us lists of plays,)how\u2014 ever, Sotion says that in that play a\n slave, named Xanthias, was represented as exhorting all his fellow-slaves to a\n life of luxury, and saying\u2014 \n Why do you talk such stuff, why run about \n To the Lyceum and the Academy, \n To the Odeum's gates, hunting in vain \n For all the sophists' nonsense? there's no good in it; \n Let us drink, drink, I say.

Accordingly Machon, the comic poet, speaks of him as a musician,\n saying\u2014 \n Dorion the musician once did come \n To Mylon, all in vain; for he could find \n No resting-place which he could hire at all; \n So on some sacred ground he sat him down, \n Which was by chance before the city gates, \n And there he saw the keeper of the temple \n Prepare a sacrifice.\u2014\"I pray thee, tell me, \n In chaste Minerva's name, and all the gods', \n What deity is it that owns this temple?\" \n The keeper thus replied: \"This is, O stranger, \n Of Jupiter-Neptune the sacred shrine.\" \n \n How then, said Dorion, \"could any man \n Expect to find a lodging in a place \n Which in one temple crowds a pair of gods?\" \n And Lynceus the Samian, the pupil of Theophrastus, and the brother of\n Duris, who wrote the Histories, and made himself tyrant of his country, writes\n thus in his Apophthegms\u2014 When a man once said to Dorion the flute-player,\n that the ray was a good fish, he said\u2014' Yes, about as good as if a man were to\n eat a boiled cloak.' And once, when some one else praised the entrails of\n tunny-fish, he said\u2014' You are quite right, but then a man must eat them as I\n eat them;' and when the man asked him how that was, he said\u2014' How? why\n willingly.' And he said that crawfish had three good qualities,\u2014exercise, good\n food, and contemplation. And once, at Cyprus, when he was supping with\n Nicocreon, he praised a goblet that there was there; and Nicocreon\n said\u2014'Whatever there is here that you fancy, the artist will make you another\n like it.' 'Let him make that,' he replied, 'for you; but do you give me this\n one. ' And this was a clever speech of the flute-player; for there is\n an old saying that\u2014 \n 'Tis not that God denies a flutist sense, \n But when he comes to blow it flies away. \n \n \n \n ","18":"\n And Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says this of him\u2014 Dorion, the great\n fish-eater, once, when his slave had neglected to buy fish, scourged him, and\n ordered him to tell him the names of the best fish; and when the boy had\n counted up the orphus, and the sea-grayling, and the conger, and others of this\n sort, he said\u2014'I desired you to tell me the names of fishes, and not of\n gods.' The same Dorion, ridiculing the description of a tempest in the\n Nautilus of Timotheus, said that he had seen a more formidable storm in a boiling\n saucepan. And Aristodemus, in the second book of his Memorials of Laughable\n Circumstances and Sayings, says \u2014 Dorion the musician was club-footed; and\n once, in some entertainment, he lost the slipper of his lame foot; on which he\n said, 'I will not wish anything more to the thief than that the slipper may fit\n him.' But that this Dorion was notorious for his epicurism in fish, is\n plain from what Mnesimachus the comic poet says in his drama called Philip\u2014 \n No, but all night Dorion the dish-piper \n Does stay in-doors with us. \n \n \n ","19":"\n I know, too, the sportive sayings which Lasus of Hermione has uttered about\n fishes; which Cham\u00e6leon of Heraclea has recorded in writing, in his book on this\n very Lasus, where he says\u2014' They say that Lasus called raw fish \u1f40\u03c0\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 (which means roasted or visible); and when many\n people wondered why he did so, he thus began to prove what he had said; arguing\n thus: 'As whatever a person can hear ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ) is\n properly called \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, and as whatever a person\n can understand by his intellect ( \u03bd\u03bf\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ) is\n properly called \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, so whatever any one can\n see ( \u1f44\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) is clearly \u1f40\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd; ; as therefore it was possible to see the fish, he evidently\n was \u1f40\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2.\u02bc .' And once, in a joke, he stole a fish\n from a fisherman, and having taken it, he gave it to one of the bystanders; and\n when the fisherman put him to his oath, he swore that he had not got it himself,\n and that he had not seen any one else take it; because, in fact, he himself had\n taken it, but some one else had got it. And then he prompted the other man, on the\n other hand, to swear that he had not taken it himself, and that he was not\n acquainted with any one else who had it; for, in fact, Lasus had taken it, and he\n himself had it.\u201d And Epicharmus jests in the same way; as, in his Logus and\n Logina,\u2014 \n \n \n A.

'Father,' says he,\n ' what do you think of your crawfish ' 'It is cold,' says he; 'take it away, \u2014I\n don't want to eat any orators.' \n And when Philemon says, in his Canvasser,\u2014 \n \n Agyrrius, when a crawfish was before him, \n On seeing him exclaim'd, Hail, dear papa! \n Still what did he do? He ate his dear papa! \n And Herodicus the Cratetian, commenting on this in his Miscellaneous\n Commentaries, says that Agyrrius was the name of the son of Callimedon. \n ","24":"\n The following people, too, have all been great epicures about fish. Antagoras the\n poet would not allow his slave to touch his fish with oil, but made him wash it;\n as Hegesander tells us. And when in the army, he was once boiling a dish of\n congers, and had his clothes girt round him, Antigonus the king, who was standing\n by, said, Tell me, Antagoras, do you think that Homer, who celebrated the\n exploits of Agamemnon, ever boiled congers And it is said that he\n answered, not without wit, And do you think that Agamemnon, who performed\n those exploits, ever busied himself about inquiring who was cooking congers in\n his army? And once, when Antagoras was cooking a bird of some kind, he\n said that he would not go to the bath, because he was afraid that the slaves might\n come and suck up the gravy. And when Philocydes said that his mother would take\n care of that, Shall I, said he, entrust the gravy of game to\n my mother? And Androcydes of Cyzicus, the painter, being very fond of\n fish, as Polemo relates, carried his luxury to such a pitch that he even painted\n with great care the fish which are around Scylla. \n ","25":"\n But concerning Philoxenus of Cythera, the dithyrambic poet, Machon the comic poet\n writes thus:\u2014 \n They say Philoxenus, the ancient poet \n Of dithyrambics, was so wonderfully \n Attach'd to fish, that once at Syracuse \n He bought a polypus two cubits long, \n Then dress'd it, and then ate it up himself, \n All but the head-and afterwards fell sick, \n Seized with a sharp attack of indigestion. \n Then when some doctor came to him to see him, \n Who saw that he was greatly out of order; \n \n If, said the doctor, \"you have any business \n Not well arranged, do not delay to settle it, \n For you will die before six hours are over.\" \n Philoxenus replied, \"All my affairs, \n O doctor, are well ended and arranged, \n Long, long ago By favour of the gods, \n I leave my dithyrambics all full-grown, \n And crown'd with many a prize of victory; \n \n And I commit them to the guardianship \n Of my dear foster-sisters, the Nine Muses, \n And join to them both Bacchus and fair Venus. \n This is my will. But now, since Charon gives \n No time, but, as in the Niobe of Timotheus, \n Keeps crying out, 'Now cross;' and deadly fate \n Calls me away, who can't be disobey'd, \n That I may go below with all my goods, \n Bring me the relics of that polypus.\" \n And in another part he says\u2014 \n Philoxenus of Cythera, as men say, \n Wished that he had a throat three cubits long; \n \n That I might drink, said he, \"as long as possible, \n And that my food may all at once delight me.\" \n And Diogenes the Cynic, having eaten a polypus raw, died of a swelling in\n the belly. But concerning Philoxenus, Sopater the parodist also speaks, saying\u2014\n \n For, between two rich courses of fine fish, \n He pleased himself by looking down the centre \n Of Aetna's crater. \n \n \n ","26":"\n And Hyperides the orator was an epicure in fish; as Timocles the comic writer\n tells us, in his Delos, where he enumerates all the people who had taken bribes\n from Harpalus: and he writes thus\u2014 \n \n A. Demosthenes has half-a-hundred talents. \n \n B. A lucky man, if no one shares with him. \n \n A. And Moerocles has got a mighty sum. \n \n B. He was a fool who gave them; lucky he \n Who got them. \n \n A. Demon and Callisthenes \n Have also got large sums. \n \n B. Well, they were poor, \n So that we well may pardon them for taking them. \n \n A. And that great orator Hyperides. \n \n B. Why, he will all our fishmongers enrich; \n An epicure! Gulls are mere Syrians, \n Compared to him. \n And in the Icarians, the same poet says\u2014 \n Then cross Hyperides, that fishy river, \n Which with a gentle sound, bubbling with boasts \n Of prudent speeches, with mild repetitions \n * * * * * \n And hired, bedews the plain of him who gave it. \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Aesculapius, says that Hyperides, besides being a\n glutton, was also a gambler. As also Axionicus, in his Lover of Euripides, says\n that Callias the orator was; and his words are\u2014 A man\n of the name of Glaucus came to this place, bringing from Pontus a kind of\n shark, a fish of extraordinary magnitude,\u2014a great dainty for epicures in fish,\n and, in fact, for all men who are devoted to the pleasures of the table. And he\n brought it on his shoulders, and said, ' Whom shall I instruct how to dress it,\n and how shall it be dressed? Will you have it soaked in a sauce of green herbs,\n or shall I baste its body with basting of warm brine, and then dress it on a\n fierce fire?' And a man named Moschio, a great flute-player, cried out that he\n should like to eat it boiled in warm pickle-juice. And this was meant as a\n reproof for you, O Calaides! for you are very fond of figs and cured fish; and\n yet you will not taste a most exquisite fish which you have served up to you in\n pickle. Reproaching him with the figs as if he were a sycophant; and\n perhaps concealing under the mention of the cured fish, some intimation of his\n having been implicated in discreditable conduct. And Hermippus says, in the third\n book of his treatise on the Pupils of Isocrates, that Hyperides was in the habit\n of taking a walk, the first thing in the morning, in the fish-market. \n ","27":"\n And Tim\u00e6us of Tauromenium says that Aristotle the philosopher was a great epicure\n in respect of fish. Matron the sophist, also, was a great fish-eater: and\n Antiphanes, in his Harp-player, intimates this; for that play begins thus\u2014 \n He tells no lie . . . . \n A man dug out his eye, as Matron does \n The eyes of fish when he comes near to them. \n And Anaxilas says, in his Morose Man,\u2014 \n Matron has carried off and eaten up \n A cestris' head; and I am quite undone. \n It being the very extravagance of gluttony to carry a thing off while\n eating it, and such a thing too as the head of a cestris; unless, perhaps, you may\n suppose, that those who are skilful in such things are aware of there being some\n particular good qualities in the head of a cestris; and if so, it belonged to\n Archestratus's gluttony to explain that to us. \n ","28":"\n But Antiphanes, in his Rich Man, gives us a catalogue of epicures, in the\n following lines:\u2014 \n Euthymus too was there, with sandals on, \n A ring upon his finger, well perfumed, \n Silently pondering on I know not what. \n \n Ph\u0153nicides too, and my friend Taureas, \n Such great inveterate epicures that they \n Would swallow all the remnants in the market; \n They at this sight seem'd almost like to die, \n And bore the scarcity with small good humour; \n But gather'd crowds and made this speech to them:\u2014 \n \"What an intolerable thing it is \n That any of you men should claim the sea, \n And spend much money in marine pursuits, \n While not one fin of fish comes to this market! \n What is the use of all our governors \n Who sway the islands? We must make a law \n That there should be copious importation \n Of every kind of fish. But Matron now \n Has carried off the fishermen; and then \n There's Diogeiton, who, by Jove, has brought \n The hucksters over to keep back for him \n All the best fish; and he's not popular \n For doing this, for there is mighty waste \n In marriage feasts and youthful luxury.\" \n But Euphron, in his Muses, says,\u2014 \n But when at some fine banquet of young men \n Ph\u0153nicides perceived a smoking dish \n Full of the sons of Nereus, he held bach \n His hands, with rage excited. Thus he spoke:\u2014 \n \"Who boasts himself a clever parasite \n At eating at the public cost? who thinks \n To filch the dainty dishes from the middle? \n Where's Corydus, or Phyromachus, or Nillus? \n Let them come here, they shall get nought of this.\" \n \n \n ","29":"\n But Melanthus the tragic poet was a person of the same sort; and he also wrote\n elegies. But Leucon, in his Men of the same Tribe, cuts his jokes upon him in the\n fashion of the comic writers, on account of his gluttony; and so does Aristophanes\n in the Peace, and Pherecrates in his Petale. But Archippus, in his play called The\n Fishes, having put him in chains as an epicure, gives him up to the fishes, to be\n eaten by them in retaliation. And, indeed, even Aristippus, the pupil of Socrates,\n was a great epicure,\u2014a man who was once reproached by Plato for his gluttony, as\n Sotion ad Hegesander relate. And the Delphian writes thus:\u2014 Aristippus, when\n Plato reproached him for having bought a number of fish, said that he had\n bought them for two obols; and when Plato said, 'I myself would have bought\n them at th t price,' 'You see, then,' said he, '0 Plato! that it is not I who\n am an epicure, but you who are a miser.' And Antiphanes, in his Female Flute-player, or the Female Twins, laughing at a\n man named Phoinicides for his gluttony, says\u2014 \n Menelaus warr'd for ten whole years against \n The Trojan nation for one lovely woman. \n Phoinicides, too, attacks Taureas \n For one fine eel. \n \n \n ","30":"\n But Demosthenes the orator reproaches Pherecrates, because, with the gold which he\n received for his treason, he bought himself courtesans and fish, and charges him\n with debauchery and gluttony. But Diodes the epicure, as Hegesander says, when a\n man once asked him which of the two fish was the best, the conger or the pike,\n said\u2014 The one when it is boiled, and the other when it is\n roasted. And Leonteus the Argive also was an epicure: he was a\n tragedian, and a pupil of Athenion, and a slave of Juba, king of Mauritania; as\n Amarantus relates, in his treatise on the Stage, saying that Juba wrote this\n epigram on him, because he had acted the character of Hypsipyle very badly:\u2014\n \n If you should wish to see the genius \n Of that devoted artichoke-devourer \n Leonteus the tragedian, don't regard \n The sorrow-stricken heart of Hypsipyle. \n I once was dear to Bacchus, and his taste \n Is ne'er perverted by base bribes t' approve \n Untuneful sounds. But now the pots and pans, \n And well-fill'd dishes have destroyed my voice, \n While I've been anxious to indulge my stomach. \n \n \n ","31":"\n And Hegesander tells us that Phoryscus, the fish-eater, once, when he was not able\n to take exactly as much fish as he wished, but when a greater part of it was\n following his hand, as he was helping himself, said,\u2014 \n But what resists is utterly destroy'd, \n and so ate up the whole fish. And Bion, when some one had been beforehand\n with him, and had already taken the upper part of the fish, having turned it round\n himself, and eating abundantly of it, said, after he had done,\u2014 \n But Ino finish'd all the rest o' the business. \n And Theocritus the Chian, when the wife of Diocles the epicure died, and\n when the widowed husband, while making a funeral feast for her, kept on eating\n delicacies and crying all the time, said\u2014 Stop crying, you wretched man; for\n you will not remedy your grief by eating all that fish. And when the same Diodes had also eaten up his land through gluttony,\n and was one day, while bolting down some hot fish, complaining that his palate\n ( \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 ) was burnt, Theocritus, who was\n present, said to him\u2014 Then it only remains for you to drink up the sea, and\n then you will have got rid of the three greatest things in the world,\u2014earth,\n and sea, and heaven ( \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ). And\n Clearchus, in his Lives, describing some person who was fond of fish,\n says\u2014 Technon, one of the old flute-players, when Charmus the\n flute-player died, (and he, too, was very fond of fish,) sacrificed to the dead\n man a large dish of every sort of fish on his tomb. Alexis the poet,\n also, was a great epicure in fish, as Lynceus the Samian tells us; and being once\n ridiculed by some chattering fellows on account of his epicurism, when they asked\n him what he liked most to eat, Alexis said, Roasted chatterers. \n \n ","32":"\n Hermippus mentions also Nothippus the tragic poet, in his Tales, thus\u2014 \n But if such a race of men \n Were to wage a present war \n With those who now exist on earth, \n And if a roast ray led them on, \n Or a fine side of well-fed pork, \n The rest might safely stay at home, \n And trust Nothippus by himself, \n For he alone would swallow up \n The whole Peloponnesus:\u2014 \n and that the man meant here was the poet, Teleclides shows plainly, in\n his Hesiods. \n Myniscus, the tragic actor, is ridiculed by Plato, the comic writer, in his\n Syrphax, as an epicure in respect of fish; where he says\u2014 \n \n A. Here is an Anagyrasian orphus for you, \n Which e'en my friend Myniscus the Chalcidean \n Could hardly finish. \n \n B. Much obliged to you. \n And for a similar reason, Callias, in his Pedet\u00e6, and Lysippus, in his\n Bacch\u00e6, ridicule Lampon the soothsayer. But Cratinus, in his Female Runaways,\n speaking of him, says\u2014 Lam- pon, whom nothing which men said of him could\n keep away from any banquet of his friends; and adds, But now\n again he is belching away; for he devours everything which he can see, and he\n would fight even for a mullet. \n \n \n ","33":"\n And Hedylus, in his Epigrams, giving a list of epicures in fish, mentions a man\n named Phaedo, in these lines:\u2014 \n But Ph\u00e6do, that great harpist, praises phyces, \n And sausages, he's such an epicure. \n And he mentions Agisoto, in these lines:\u2014 \n The fish is boil'd, now firmly bar the doors, \n Lest Agis, Proteus of the dishes, enter; \n For he'll be fire, water,\u2014what he likes; \n But bar the door . . . . . . \n For he, transform'd, like Jupiter, to gold \n Will hasten to this rich Acrisian dish. \n He also speaks of a woman named Clio, on a similar account, saying\u2014\n \n Clio's an epicure. Let's shut our eyes. \n I beg you, Clio, by yourself to feed. \n This conger costs a drachma; leave a pledge, \n A band, an earring, or some ornament. \n But we cannot endure the sight of you; \n You're our Medusa; and we're turn'd to stone, \n Not by the Gorgon, but by that whole conger. \n \n \n ","34":"\n And Aristodemus, in his Catalogue of Laughable Sayings, says that Euphranor the\n epicure, having heard that another epicure in fish was dead from having eaten a\n hot slice of fish, cried out, What a sacrilegious death! And Cindon\n the fish-eater, and Demylus (and he also was an epicure in fish), when a\n sea-grayling was set before them, and nothing else, the former took one eye of the\n fish, and then Demylus seized hold of Cindon's eye, crying, Let his eye go,\n and I will let your's go. And once at a feast, when a fine dish of fish\n was served up, Demylus, not being able to contrive any way by which he might get\n the whole of it to himself, spat upon it. And Zeno the Citti\u00e6an, the founder of\n the Stoic school, when he had lived a long time with a great epicure in fish, (as\n Antigonus the Carystian tells us, in his life of Zeno,) once, when a very large\n fish was by chance served up to them, and when no other food was provided, took\n the whole fish from the platter, pretending to be about to eat it all himself;\n and, when the other looked at him, said\u2014 What do you think, then, that those\n who live with you must suffer every day, if you cannot endure my being a\n glutton for a single day? And Ister says that Ch\u0153rilus the poet used to\n receive four min\u00e6 every day from Archelaus, and that he spent them all on fish, of\n which he was so exceedingly fond. \n \n I am aware, also, that there have been boys who were great fish-eaters, who are\n mentioned by Clearchus, in his book on Sands; which says that Psammitichus, king\n of Egypt, bred up some boys to eat nothing but fish, when he was anxious to\n discover the source of the Nile; and that he accustomed others to endure a great\n degree of thirst, who were to be employed in exploring the sands in Libya; of\n whom, however, very few escaped in safety. I know, too, that the oxen around\n Mosynus, in Thrace, eat fish, which are given to them in their cribs. And\n Ph\u0153nicides, having set fish before men who had brought their contribution for a\n banquet, said that the sea was common, but that the fish in it belonged to those\n who bought them. \n ","35":"\n And, my friends, the noun \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (an eater of\n fish), and the verb \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9 (to eat fish), are\n both used. Aristophanes, in his second edition of the Clouds, says\u2014 \n Not to eat fish ( \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ) nor to\n giggle. \n And Cephisodorus, in his Pig, says\u2014 \n Not a fish-eater ( \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ) nor a\n chatterer. \n Machon, in his Letter, says\u2014 \n I am a fish-eater ( \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ), and this is\n now \n The whole foundation of the art we practise. \n And he who wishes not to spoil the dishes \n Served up to others, should be pleased himself. \n For he who rightly cares for his own eating \n Will not be a bad cook. And if you keep \n Your organs, sense and taste, in proper order, \n You will not err. But often taste your dishes \n While you are boiling them. Do they want salt? \n Add some;\u2014is any other seasoning needed \n Add it, and taste again-till you've arrived \n At harmony of flavour; like a man \n Who tunes a lyre till it rightly sounds. \n And then, when everything is well in tune, \n Bring in a troop of willing damsels fair, \n Equal in number to the banqueters. \n In addition to these epicures in fish, my friends, I am aware also that\n Apollo is honoured among the Eleans, under the title of Fish-eater: and Polemo\n mentions this name of his in his letter to Attalus. I am aware, also, that in Pisa\n there is a picture consecrated in the temple of Diana Alphosa (and it is the work\n of Cleanthes the Corinthian), in which Neptune is represented as bringing a tunny\n to Jupiter in labour; as. Demetrius tells us, in the eighth book of his Trojan\n Array. \n \n ","36":"\n These, then, are the things, said Democritus, which I myself have brought in the\n way of my contribution, not going to eat fish myself, for the sake of my excellent\n friend Ulpian; who, on account of the national customs of the Syrians, has\n deprived us of our fish, continually bringing forward one thing after another. And\n Antipater of Tarsus, the Stoic philosopher, in the fourth book of his treatise on\n Superstition, tells us that it is said by some people that Gatis, the queen of the\n Syrians, was so exceedingly fond of fish, that she issued a proclamation that no\n one should eat fish without Gatis being invited ( \u1f04\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\n \u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ); and that the common people, out of ignorance, thought her\n name was Atergatis, and abstained wholly from fish. And Mnaseus, in the second\n book of his History of Asia, speaks thus\u2014 But I think that Atergatis was a\n very bad queen, and that she ruled the people with great harshness, so that she\n even forbad them by law to eat fish, and ordered them to bring all the fish to\n her, because she was so fond of that food; and, on account of this order of\n hers, a custom still prevails, when the Syrians pray to the goddess, to offer\n her golden or silver fish; and for the priests every day to place on the table\n before the god real fish also, carefully dressed, both boiled and roasted,\n which the priests of the goddess eat themselves. And a little further\n on, he says again\u2014 But Atergatis (as Xanthus the Lydian says), being taken\n prisoner by Mopsus, king of Lydia, was drowned with her son in the lake near\n Ascalon, because of her insolence, and was eaten up by fishes. \n \n ","37":"\n And you, perhaps, my friends, have willingly passed by (as if it were some sacred\n fish) the fish mentioned by Ephippus the comic poet, which he says was dressed for\n Geryon, in his play called Geryon. The lines are these:\u2014 \n \n A. When the natives of the land \n Catch a fish which is not common, \n But fine, as large as the whole isle \n Of Crete, he furnishes a dish \n Able to hold a hundred such; \n And orders all who live around, \n Sindi, and Lycians, and Paphians, \n Cranai, and Mygdoniot\u00e6, \n To cut down wood, because the king \n Is boiling this enormous fish. \n So then they bring a load of wood, \n Enough to go all round the city, \n \n And light the fire. Then they bring \n A lake of water to make brine, \n And for eight months a hundred carts \n Are hard at work to carry salt. \n And around the dish's edge \n Five five-oar'd boats keep always rowing; \n And bid the slaves take care the fire \n Burns not the Lycian magistrates. \n \n B. Cease to blow this cold air on us, \n King of Macedon, extinguish \n The Celts, and do not burn them more. \n But I am not ignorant that Ephippus has said the very same thing in his\n play called the Peltast; in which the following lines also are subjoined to those\n which I have just quoted:\u2014 \n Talking all this nonsense, he \n Raises the wonder of the youths \n With whom he feasts, though knowing not \n The simplest sums and plainest figures; \n But drags his cloak along the ground \n With a most lordly, pompous air. \n But, with reference to whom it is that Ephippus said this, it is now\n proper for you to inquire, my good friend Ulpian, and then to tell us; and in this\n inquiry\u2014 \n If you find aught hard and inexplicable, \n Repeat it over, understand it clearly,\u2014 \n For I have much more leisure than I like; \n as Prometheus says in Aeschylus. \n ","38":"\n And on this Cynulcus exclaimed:\u2014And what great subject of inquiry,\u2014I do not say\n great fish,\u2014can this fellow admit into his mind?-a man who is always picking out\n the spines of hepseti and atherint\u00e6, and even of worse fish than these, if there\n be any such, passing over all finer fish. \n For, as Eubulus says, in the Ixion,\u2014 \n As if a man at a luxurious feast, \n When cheese-cakes are before him, chooses nought \n But anise, parsley, and such silly fare, \n And ill-dress'd cardamums . . . . \n so, too, this Pot-friend, Ulpian,\u2014to use a would of my\n fellow-Megalopolitan, Cercidas,\u2014appears to me to eat nothing that a man ought to\n eat, but to watch those who are eating, to see if they have passed over any spine\n or any callous or gristly morsel of the meat set before them; never once\n considering what the admirable and brilliant Aeschylus has said, who called his\n tragedies, Relics of the noble banquets of Homer. But Aeschylus was\n one of the greatest of philosophers,\u2014a man who, being once defeated undeservedly,\n as Theophrastus or Cham\u00e6leon (whichever was really the author\n of the book), in his treatise on Pleasure, has related, said that he committed his\n tragedies to time, well knowing that he should hereafter receive the honour due to\n him. \n ","39":"\n But whence could Ulpian know what Stratonicus the harp-player said about Propis\n the Rhodian harp-player? For Clearchus, in his book on Proverbs, says that\n Stratonicus, when he had seen Propis, who was a man of great size, but a very\n inferior artist, with a mind much less than his body, said to some one who asked\n him what sort of player he was, \n \n \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u1fd6\u03c2\u00b7 \n \n speaking enigmatically, and saying, first of all, that he is \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2, no one, or good for nothing; secondly, that he\n is \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2, bad; and, in addition to this, that he\n is \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, great; and, lastly, \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u1f7a\u03c2, a fish, as having no voice. But Theophrastus, in\n his book on The Laughable, says that this was a proverb originating with\n Stratonicus, but applied to Simmychas the actor; for that he uttered the proverb,\n dividing the words distinctly\u2014 \n \n \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u1fe6\u03c2. \n \n And Aristotle, in his Constitution of the Naxians, speaks thus of this\n proverb\u2014 Of the rich men among the Naxians, the greater part lived in the\n city, but the remainder lived scattered about in the villages. Accordingly, in\n one of these villages, the name of which was Lestad\u00e6, Telestagoras lived, a man\n of great riches and of very high reputation, and greatly honoured by the people\n in other respects, and also with daily presents which they used to send him.\n And whenever people from the city, going down to the market, wanted to drive a\n hard bargain for anything they wished to purchase, the sellers would say that\n they would rather give it to Telestagoras than sell it for such a price as was\n offered. So some young men, buying a large fish, when the fisherman made this\n speech, being annoyed at hearing this so often, having already drunk a good\n deal, went to his house to sup; and Telestagoras received them in a very\n friendly and hospitable manner, but the young men insulted him, and his two\n marriageable daughters. At which the Naxians were very indignant, and took up\n arms and attacked the young men; and there was a great sedition, Lygdamis being\n the leader of the Naxians, who, having got the chief command in this sedition,\n became the tyrant of his country. \n \n ","40":"\n And I do not think it unseasonable myself, since I have\n mentioned the harp-player Stratonicus, to say some- thing also concerning his\n readiness in repartee. For when he was teaching people to play the harp, and as he\n had in his school nine statues of the nine Muses, and one of Apollo, and had also\n two pupils, when some one asked him how many pupils he had, he said, Gods\n and all, twelve. And once when he had travelled to Mylassa, and saw\n thee a great number of temples, but very few citizens, standing in the middle of\n the forum, he cried out\u2014 \n \n \u02bc\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af. \n \n \n And Macho has recorded some memorials of him in these lines;\u2014 \n Once Stratonicus travell'd down to Pella, \n And having heard from many men before \n That the baths of that city were accustom'd \n To give the bathers spleen; and finding, too, \n That many of the youths did exercise \n Before the fire, who preserved their colour \n And vigour of their body unimpair'd; \n He said that those who told him so were wrong. \n But finding afterwards, when he left the bath, \n A man whose spleen was twice his belly's size,\u2014 \n \n This man, said he, \"appears to me here now \n To sit and keep the garments of the men \n Who go to bathe, and all their spleens beside, \n That all the people may have room enough.\" \n A miserable singer once did give \n A feast to Stratonicus and his friends, \n And, while the cup was freely going round, \n Exhibited his art to all the company. \n And as the feast was rich and liberal,' \n Poor Stratonicus, wearied with the song, \n And having no one near him he could speak to, \n Knock'd down his cup, and asked for a larger. \n And when he'd drunk full many a draught, he made \n A last libation to the glorious sun, \n And then composed himself to sleep, and left \n The rest to fortune. Presently more guests \n Came, as good luck would have it, to the singer, \n To feast with him; still Stratonicus slept, \n Heavy with wine; and when they ask'd him why \n A man so much accustom'd to drink wine \n Had been so soon o'ercome by drink this day, \n \n This treacherous, cursed singing man, said he, \n \"Treated me like a bullock in a stall; \n For first he fed me up, and then he kill'd me.\" \n \n Once Stratonicus to Abdera went, \n To see some games which there were celebrated; \n And seeing every separate citizen \n Having a private crier to himself, \n And each of them proclaiming a new moon \n Whene'er he pleased, so that the criers were \n Quite out of all proportion to the citizens, \n He walk'd about on tiptoes through the city, \n Looking intently on the ground beneath. \n And when some stranger ask'd him what had happen'd \n To his feet, to make him look so gravely at them:\u2014 \n He said, \"I'm very well all over, friend, \n And can run faster to an entertainment \n Than any parasite; but I'm in fear \n Lest I should tread by hazard on some \u03ba\u1fc6\u03c1\u03c5\u03be, \n \n \n And pierce my foot with its spikes and lame myself.\" \n Once, when a wretched flute-player was preparing \n To play the flute at a sacred festival, \n \n Let us have only sounds of omen good, \n \n Said Stratonicus; \"let us pour libations \n And pray devoutly to the mighty gods.\" \n There was a harper, and his name was Cleon, \n But he was nick-named Ox; he sang most vilely \n Without th' accompaniment of the lyre. \n When Stratonicus heard him, then he said, \n \"I've often heard of asses at the lyre, \n But now I see an ox in the same case.\" \n The harper Stratonicus once had sail'd \n To Pontus, to see king Berisad\u00e6s. \n And when he'd staid in Pontus long enough, \n He thought he would return again to Greece. \n But when the king refused to let him go, \n They say that Stratonicus said to him\u2014 \n \n Why, do you mean to stay here long yourself? \n \n The harper Stratonicus once was staying \n Some time at Corinth; when an aged woman \n One day stood looking at him a long time, \n And would not take her eyes off: then said he, \n \"Tell me, I pray you, in God's name, good mother, \n What is 't you wish, and why you look thus on me?\" \n \n I marvell'd, said she, \"how 'twas your mother \n Held you nine months, without her belly bursting, \n While this town can't endure you one whole day.\" \n Fair Biothea, Nicotheon's wife, \n Once at a party with a handmaid fair \n Made some strange noise; and after that, by chance, \n She trod upon a Sicyonian almond. \n Then Stratonicus said, The noise is different. \n \n But when night came, for this heedless word, \n He wash'd out his free-speaking in the sea. \n \n Once, when at Ephesus, as rumour goes, \n A stupid harper was exhibiting \n One of his pupils to a band of friends; \n Stratonicus, who by chance was present, said, \n \"He cannot make himself a harp-player, \n And yet he tries to teach the art to others.\" \n \n \n ","41":"\n And Clearchus, in the second book of his treatise on Friendship,\n says,\u2014 Stratonicus the harp-player, whenever he wished to go to sleep,\n used to order a slave to bring him something to drink; 'not,' says he, 'because\n I am thirsty now, but that I may not be presently.' And once, at\n Byzantium, when a harp-player had played his prelude well, but had made a blunder\n of the rest of the performance, he got up and made proclamation, That\n whoever would point out the harp-player who had played the prelude should\n receive a thousand drachm\u00e6. And when he was once asked by some one who\n were the wickedest people, he said, That in Pamphylia, the people of\n Phaselis were the worst; but that the Sidet\u00e6 were the worst in the whole\n world. And when he was asked again, according to the account given by\n Hegesander, which were the greatest barbarians, the B\u0153otians or the Thessalians,\n he said, The Eleans. And once he erected a trophy in his school,\n and put this inscription on it\u2014 Over the bad harpplayers. And once,\n being asked by some one which was the safer kind of vessel, the long one or the\n round one,\u2014 Those, quoth he, are the safest which are in\n dock. And once he made a display of his art at Rhodes, and no one\n applauded; on which he left the theatre, and when he had got into the air he said,\n When you fail to give what costs you nothing, how can I expect any solid\n pay from you? \n Let the Eleans, said he, celebrate gymnastic contests, and\n let the Corinthians establish choral, and the Athenians theatrical exhibitions;\n and if any one of them does anything wrong, let the Laced\u00e6monians be\n scourged, \u2014jesting upon the public scourgings exhibited in that city, a\n Charicles relates, in the first book of his treatise on the Cit Contests. And when\n Ptolemy the king was talking with him in an ambitious kind of way about\n harp-playing, Te sceptre, said he, Oking, is one thing, and\n the plectrum another; as Capito the epic poet says in the fourth book\n of his Commentaries addressed to Philopappus. And once being invited to hear a\n flute-player, after he had heard him, he said\u2014 \n \n The father granted half his prayer, \n The other half denied. \n And when some one asked him which half he granted, he said, He\n granted to him to play very badly, and denied him the ability to sing\n well. And once, when a beam fell down and slew some wicked man,\n O Men, said he, I think ( \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u1ff6 ) there are gods; and if not, there are beams ( \u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 ). \n \n ","42":"\n Also, after the before-mentioned witticisms of Stratonicus, he put down besides a\n list of these things following. \n Stratonicus said once to the father of Chrysogonus, when he was saying that he had\n everything at home in great abundance, for that he himself had undertaken the\n works, and that of his sons, one could teach and another play the flute; You still, said Stratonicus,\n want one thing. And when the other asked him what that was,\n You want, said he, a theatre in your house. And\n when some one asked him why he kept travelling over the whole of Greece, and did\n not remain in one city, he said\u2014 That he had received from the Muses all the\n Greeks as his wages, from whom he was to levy a tax to atone for their\n ignorance. And he said that Phaon did not play harmony, but Cadmus. And when Phaon pretended to great skill on\n the flute, and said that he had a chorus at Megara, You are joking, \n said he; for you do not possess anything there, but you are possessed\n yourself. And he said\u2014 That he marvelled above all things at the\n mother of Satyrus the Sophist, because she had borne for nine months a man whom\n no city in all Greece could bear for nine days. And once, hearing that\n he had arrived in Ilium at the time of the Ilian games, There are, \n said he, always troubles in Ilium. And when Minnacus was disputing\n with him about music, he said\u2014 That he was not attending to what he said,\n because he had got in above his ankles. At another time he said of a\n bad physician\u2014 That he made those who were attended by him go to the shades\n below the very day they came to him. And having met one of his\n acquaintances, when he saw his sandals carefully sponged, he pitied him as being\n badly off, pretending to think that he would never have had his sandals so well\n sponged if he had not sponged them himself. And as it was a very mixed race of people who lived at Teichius, a town in the Milesian\n territory, when he saw that all the tombs about were those of foreigners,\n Let us begone, O boy, said he; or all the strangers, as\n it seems, die here, and none of the citizens. And when Zethus the\n harper was giving a lecture upon music, he said that he was the only person who\n was utterly unfit to discuss the subject of music, inasmuch as he had chosen the\n most unmusical of all names, and called himself; Zethus instead of\n Amphion. And once, when he was teaching some Macedonian to play on the harp, being\n angry that he did nothing as he ought, he said, Go to Macedonia. \n \n ","43":"\n And when he saw the shrine of some hero splendidly adorned, close to a cold and\n worthless bathing-house, when he came out, having had a very bad bath, I do\n not wonder, said he, that many tablets are dedicated here; for\n every one of the bathers naturally offers one, as having been saved from\n drowning. And at another time he said\u2014, In Aenus there are eight\n months of cold and four of winter. At another time he said, that\n the people of Pontus had come out of a great sea \u2014as though he had said\n (great) trouble. And he called the Rhodians White Cyren\u00e6ans, and the city he\n called the City of Suitors; and Heraclea he called the Man- Corinth; and Byzantium\n he called the Arm-pit of Greece; and the Leucadians were Stale Corinthians; and\n the Ambraciotes he called Membraciotes. And when he had gone out of the gates of\n Heraclea, and was looking round him, when some one asked him what he was looking\n at, he said that he was ashamed of being seen, as if he were coming out of\n a brothel. And once, seeing two men bound in the stocks, he\n said\u2014 This is suited to the disposition of a very insignificant city, not\n to be able to fill such a place as this. And once he said to a man who\n professed to be a musician, but who had been a gardener before, and who was\n disputing with him about harmony,\u2014 \n Let each man sing the art in which he's skilled. \n And once at Maronea, when he was drinking with some people, he\n said,\u2014 That he could tell in what part of the city he was, if men led him\n through it blindfold; and then when they did so lead him, and asked him\n where he was, Near the eating-house, said he, because all Maronea\n seemed a mere eating-house. And once, when he was sitting\n next to Telephanes, and he was beginning to blow the flute, he said,\n Higher, like men who belch. And when the bathing-man in Cardia\n brought him some bad earth and salt water to cleanse himself with, he said that he\n was being besieged both by land and sea. \n ","44":"\n And when he had conquered his competitors at Sicyon, he set up a trophy in the\n temple of Aesculapius, and wrote upon it, Stratonicus, conqueror of those\n who played badly on the harp. And when some one had sung, he asked what\n tune he had been singing; and when he said that it was an air of Carcinus, \n More like that, said he, than the air of a man. He\n also said, on another occasion, that there was no spring at Maronea, only heat.\n And once at Phaselis, when the bathing-man was wrangling with his boy about the\n money, (for the law was that foreigners should pay more for bathing than natives,)\n Oh, you wretched boy! said he, you have almost made me a\n citizen of Phaselis, to save a halfpenny. And once, when a person was\n praising him in hopes to get something by it, he said, that he himself was\n a greater beggar. And once, when he was teaching in a small town, he\n said, This is not a city ( \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 ), but\n hardly one ( \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 ). And once, when he\n was at Pella, he came to a well, and asked whether it was fit to drink; and when\n those who were drawing water from it said, At all events we drink\n it; \n Then, said he, I am sure it is not fit to drink: for\n the men happened to be very sallow-looking. And when he had heard the poem of\n Timotheus, on the subject of Semele in Labour, he said, But if she had\n brought forth an artisan, and not a god, what sounds would she have\n uttered! \n \n And when Polyidas was giving himself airs, because his pupil Philotas had beaten\n Timotheus, he said, That he wondered at his being so ignorant as not to\n know that he makes decrees, and Timotheus laws. And he said to Areus\n the harp-player, who was annoying him, Play to the crows. \n And once he was at Sicyon, when a leather-dresser was abusing him, and he\n said to the leather-dresser ( \u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03ad\u03c8\u03b7\u03c2 ), O\n you \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd. \n And Stratonicus himself, beholding the Rhodians dissolved in luxury, and\n drinking only warm drinks, said, that there were white Cyren\u00e6ans. \n And he called Rhodes itself the City of the Suitors, thinking that they were in\n no respect different from the Cyren\u00e6ans in debauchery, but only in complexion; and\n also because of the devotion to pleasure of the inhabitants, he compared Rhodes\n itself to the city of the Suitors. \n ","45":"\n And Stratonicus was, in all these elaborate witticisms, an imitator of Simonides\n the poet, as Ephorus tells us in the second book of his treatise on Inventions;\n who says that Philoxenus of Cythera was also a great studier of the same pursuit.\n And Ph\u00e6nias the Peripatetic, in the second book of his treatise on Poets,\n says\u2014 Stratonicus the Athenian appears to have been the first person who\n introduced the system of playing chords into the simple harp-playing; and he\n was the first man who ever took pupils in music, and who ever composed tables\n of music. And he was also a man of no small brilliancy as a wit. He\n says also that he was eventually put to death by Nicocles, the King of the\n Cyprians, on account of the freedom of his witticisms, being compelled to drink\n poison, because he had turned the sons of the king into ridicule. \n ","46":"\n But I marvel at Aristotle, whom these wise men, my excellent Democritus, are so\n incessantly speaking of and praising, (and whose writings you also esteem highly,\n as you do those of the other philosophers and orators,) on account of his great\n accuracy: and I should like to know when he learnt, or from what Proteus or Nereus\n who came up from the depths he found out, what fish do, or how they go to sleep,\n or how they live: for all these things he has told us in his writings, so as to\n be, in the words of the comic poets, a wonder to fools; for he says\n that the ceryx, and indeed that the whole race of shell-fish, are propagated\n without copulation; and that the purple-fish and the ceryx are longlived. For how\n could he know that the purple-fish lives six years? and how could he know that the\n viper takes a long time to propagate his species? or that of all its tribe the\n longest at that work is the pigeon, the next the \u0153nas, and the quickest is the\n turtle-dove? And whence did he learn that the horse lives five-and-thirty years,\n but the mare more than forty? saying, too, that some have lived even seventy-five\n years. And he also states that from the copulation of lice there are born nits; and that from a worm, after its change, there is\n produced a caterpillar, from which comes the humble-bee, and from that the larva\n of the silk-worm. And he also says that bees live to six years of age, and that\n some live even seven years; and he says that neither bee nor wasp have ever been\n seen in the act of copulation, on which account no one can ever tell whether they\n are male or female. And from what did he learn that men are inferior to bees? for\n these latter always preserve an equal condition of life, being subject to no\n changes, but employing themselves without ceasing in the collection of honey, and\n doing that without having been taught by any one to do so: but men are inferior to\n bees, and as full of fancy as bees are of honey: how, then has Aristotle observed\n all these things? And in his treatise on Long Life, he says that a fly has been\n seen which had lived six or seven years. But what proof is there of this? \n ","47":"\n And where did he ever see ivy growing out of a stag's head? And again, owls and\n night-jars, he says, cannot see by day; on which account they hunt for their food\n by night, and they do this not during the whole night, but at the beginning of\n evening. And he says, too, that there are several different kinds of eyes, for\n some are blue, and some are black, and some are hazel. He says, too, that the eyes\n of men are of different characters, and that the differences of disposition may be\n judged of from the eyes; for that those men who have goats' eyes, are exceedingly\n sharp-sighted, and have the best dispositions. And of others, he says that some\n men have projecting eyes, and some have eyes deeply set, and some keep a mean\n between the two: and those whose eyes are deeply set, he says, have the sharpest\n sight, and those whose eyes project, must have the worst dispositions; and those\n who are moderate in these respects, are people, says he, of moderate dispositions.\n There are also some people whose eyes are always winking, and some who never wink\n at all, and some who do so in a moderate degree: and those who are always winking\n are shameless people, and those who never wink at all are\n unstable and fickle, and those who wink in a moderate degree have the best\n disposition. \n \n He says also that man is the only animal which has its heart on the left side; and\n that all other animals have it in the middle of the body. And he says that males\n have more teeth than females; and he affirms that this has been noticed in the\n case of the sheep, and of the pig, and of the goat. And he says also that there is\n no fish which has testicles, and there is no fish which has a breast, and no bird\n ether; but that the only fish which has no gall is the dolphin. There are,\n however, some, says he, which have no gall in their liver, but they have it near\n their bowels; as the sturgeon, the synagris, the lamprey, the sword-fish, and the\n sea-swallow. But the amia has its gall spread over the whole of its entrails: and\n the hawk and the kite have theirs spread both over their liver and their entrails;\n but the \u00e6gocephalus has his gall both in his liver and in his stomach: and the\n pigeon, and the quail, and the swallow have theirs, some in their entrails, and\n some in their stomach. \n ","48":"\n Moreover, he says that all the molluscous fish, and the shell-fish, and the\n cartilaginous fish, and all insects, spend a long time in copulation; but that the\n dolphin and some other fish copulate lying alongside the female. And he says that\n the dolphins are very slow, but fish in general very quick. Again he says that the\n lion has very solid bones, and that if they are struck, fire comes from them as\n from flint stones. And that the dolphin has bones, but no spine; but that\n cartilaginous fish have both gristle and spine. And of animals he says that some\n are terrestrial and some aquatic; land that some even live in the fire; and that\n there are some, which he calls ephemera, which live only one day: and that there\n are some which are amphibious, such as the river-horse, and the crocodile, and the\n otter. And that all animals in general have two forefeet, but that the crab has\n four; and that all the animals which have blood are either without feet t all, or\n are bipeds, or quadrupeds; and that all the animals which have more than four feet\n are destitute of blood: n which account every animal which moves, moves by what he\n calls four tokens,\u2014man by two hands and two feet, a bird by two feet and two\n wings, an eel and a conger by two fins and two joints. Moreover, some animals have\n hands, as a man has, and some appear to have hands, as a monkey does; or there is\n no brute beast which can really give and take, and it is for \n those things that hands are given to men as instruments. Again, some animals have\n limbs, as a man, an ox, an ass; and some have no limbs, as a serpent, an oyster,\n the pulmo marinus. There are also many animals which are not always visible, such\n as those which hide in holes; and those which do not hide in holes are still not\n always visible, as swallows and cranes. \n ","49":"\n And though I could repeat to you now a great deal of nonsense which the\n medicine-seller talked, I forbear to do so, although I know that Epicurus, that\n most truthful of men, said of him in his letter about Institutions, that he\n devoted himself to a military life after having squandered his patrimony in\n gluttony; and that, turning out an indifferent soldier, he then took to selling\n medicines. Then, when the school of Plato was opened, he says, he changed again,\n and applied himself to philosophical discussions, and as he was not a man\n destitute of ability, by little and little he became a speculative philosopher. I\n know, too, that Epicurus is the only person who ever said this of him; for neither\n did Eubulides nor Cephisodorus venture to say anything of the kind against the\n Stagirite, and that, too, though they did write books against him. But in that\n same letter Epicurus says, that Protagoras also, who became a philosopher from\n having been a porter and a wood-carrier, was first promoted to be an amanuensis of\n Democritus; who, wondering at the admirable way in which he used to put the wood\n together, took him under his eye in consequence of this beginning; and then he\n began to teach the rudiments of learning in some village, and after that he\n proceeded on to the study of philosophy. And I now, O fellow feasters, after all\n this conversation, feel a great desire for something to eat. And when some one\n said that the cooks were already preparing something, and taking care that the\n dishes should not be served up cold, on account of the excessive length to which\n the feast of words had been carried, for that no one could eat cold\n dishes, Cynulcus said,\u2014But I, like the Milcon of Alexis, the comic poet, can eat\n them even if they are not served up warm\u2014 \n For Plato teaches us that what is good, \n Is everywhere on all occasions good; \n Can you deny this? and that what is sweet \n Is always sweet, here, there, and ev'rywhere. \n \n And it was not without some cleverness that Sph\u00e6rus, who was\n a fellow-pupil with Chrysippus in the school of Cleanthes, when he had been sent\n for to Alexandria by king Ptolemy; when on one occasion birds made of wax were\n served up at a banquet, and he was putting out his hand to take some, but was\n stopped by the king, who told him that he was assenting to a sham; very\n appropriately answered,\u2014'That he did not agree that they were birds at all, but\n only that it was probable that they might be birds; and that an opinion which\n could be confirmed by the perception, is superior to that which is merely\n probable; for that the one cannot be incorrect, but that what is probable may turn\n out Contrary to what was expected.\" And so it could not be a bad thing if some\n waxen dishes were brought round to us too, according to our perceptive opinions,\n so that we might be beguiled at least by the sight of them, and so escape talking\n on for ever. \n ","50":"\n And when they were now on the point of sitting down to eat again, Daphnus bade\n them stop, quoting this iambic out of the Mammacythus or Auri of Metagenes\u2014 \n As when we're feasting anywhere, \n Then we all talk and argue faster. \n And indeed, said he, I say that the discussion about fish is still\n defective in some points, since the sons of Aesculapius (such as Philotimus I\n mean, in his essay on Food, and Mnesitheus the Athenian, and Diphilus the\n Siphnian) hare said a good deal about fishes, of which we have as yet taken no\n notice. For Diphilus, in his work entitled A Treatise on Food fit for People in\n Health and Invalids, says,\u2014\"Of sea-fish, those which keep to the rocks are easily\n digested, and juicy, and purgative, and light, but not very nutritious; but those\n which keep in the deep water are much less digestible, very nutritious, but apt to\n disagree with one. Now, of the fish which keep to the rocks, the phycen and the\n phycis are very tender little fish, and very digestible; but the perch, which is\n like them, varies a little as to the places in which it is found. And the tench\n resembles the perch; but the smaller tench and the white ones are tender, juicy,\n and digestible; but the green ones (and they are also called caulin\u00e6) are dry, and\n devoid of juice. The chann\u00e6 also have tender meat, put still they are harder than\n the perch. Then there is the scarus, which has tender flesh, not very firm, sweet,\n light, digestible, not apt to disagree with one, and good for\n the stomach. But the fresh ones are less popular than the others, because they\n hunt the sea-hares and feed on them, owing to which their entrails are apt to\n produce cholera morbus. And the fish which is called ceris is tender, good for the\n bowels, and good for the stomach; but its juice has fattening and purgative\n qualities. The orphus, which some write \u1f40\u03c1\u03c6\u1f78\u03c2, and\n some \u1f40\u03c1\u03c6\u1f7c\u03c2, is very full of a pleasant juice,\n glutinous, indigestible, very nutritious, diuretic. But the parts near his head\n are glutinous and digestible; but the more fleshy parts are indigestible and\n heavy, and the part towards the tail is the tenderest part; and he is a fish apt\n to generate phlegm, and indigestible. The sphyren\u00e6 are more nutritious than the\n congers; and the eel caught in lakes is not so nice as the sea-eel, but it is more\n nutritious. The chrysophrys is very like the melanurus; and the sea-scorpions,\n which are found in the deep sea, and are of a tawny colour, are more nutritious\n than those which are found in marshes, or than the large ones which are taken on\n the shores. \n ","51":"\n \"But the sparus is harsh-tasted, tender, with no unpleasant smell, good for the\n stomach, diuretic, and not indigestible; but when he is fried he is indigestible.\n The mullet is good for the stomach, very astringent, of very firm flesh, not very\n digestible, apt to bind the bowels, especially when it is broiled; but when it is\n fried in a frying-pan, then it is heavy and indigestible; and, as a general rule,\n the whole tribe of mullets has the property of causing secretions of blood. The\n synodon and the charax are of the same kind, but the charax is the better of the\n two. The phagrus is found both in the river and in the sea; but that which is\n found in the sea is the best. The capriscus is called also the mussel; but it has\n a strong smell, and very hard meat, and it is more indigestible than the citharus;\n but its skin is very pleasant to the taste. The needle-fish, or belone, and it is\n also called the ablennes, is indigestible and moist, but good for the bowels. The\n thrissa, and those of the same kind, such as the chalcis and the eretimis, are\n very digestible. The cestreus is found in the sea, and in rivers, and in lakes.\n And this fish, says he, is also called the oxyrhynchus; but the one which is taken\n in the Nile is called the coracinus. And the black kind is smaller than the white,\n and when boiled it is not so good as when it is roasted; for when roasted it is\n good for the stomach and good for the bowels. The salpe is\n hard- fleshed, and unpleasant to the taste, but the best are those which are\n caught at Alexandria, and those which are taken in the autumn. For it is white,\n full of moisture, and free from any unpleasant smell. The gryllus is like the eel\n in appearance, but it is not nice to the taste. The sea-hawk is harder than the\n sea-cuckoo, but in other respects they are much alike. The uranoscopus, and also\n the fish called agus, which is also called the callionymus, are heavy fish. The\n boax, when boiled, is very digestible, giving out a very wholesome juice, and is\n good for the stomach; and that which is broiled on the coals is sweeter and more\n tender. The bacchus is full of abundant and agreeable and wholesome juice, and is\n very nutritious. The sea-goat is not very agreeable as to its juice, not very\n digestible, and has a disagreeable smell. The sea-sparrow and the buglossus are\n both nutritious and palatable, and the turbot is like them. The sea-grayling, the\n cephalus, the cestreus, the myxinus, and the colon are all much alike as to their\n eatable properties; but the cestreus is inferior to the cephalus, the myxinus is\n worse, and the colon is the least good of all. \n ","52":"\n \"The thynnis and the thynnus are both heavy and nutritious; but the fish which is\n called the Acarnanian is sweet, very exciting, very nutritious, and easily\n secreted. The anchovy is heavy and indigestible, and the white kind is called the\n cobitis; and the hepsetus, a little fish, if of the same genus. \n \"Of cartilaginous fish, the sea-cow is fleshy, but the shark is superior to\n that,\u2014that kind, I mean, which is called the asterias. But the alopecias, or\n sea-fox, is in taste very like the land animal, from which circumstance, indeed,\n it has its name. The ray is a very delicate fish to the taste; but the stellated\n ray is tenderer still, and full of excellent juice; but the smooth ray is less\n wholesome for the stomach, and has an unpleasant smell. But the torpedo, which is\n hard of digestion, is in the parts below the head very tender, and good for the\n stomach, and, moreover, very digestible, but its other parts are not so; and the\n small ones are the best, especially when they are plain boiled. The rhine, which\n is one of th cartilaginous class, is very digestible and light; but those of the\n largest size are the most nutritious; and, as a general rule, \n all the cartilaginous fish are apt to create flatulence, and are fleshy, and\n difficult of digestion, and if they are eaten in any quantity, they are bad for\n the eyes. The cuttlefish, when boiled, is tender, palatable, and digestible, and\n also good for the stomach; but the juice which comes from it has the property of\n making the blood thin, and is apt to cause secretions by hemorrhoids. The squid is\n more digestible, and is nutritious, especially the small-sized one; but when\n boiled they are harder, and not palatable. The polypus promotes amativeness, but\n it is hard and indigestible; and those of the largest size are the most\n nutritious, and when they are much boiled, they have a tendency to fill the\n stomach with liquid, and they bind the bowels. And Alexis, in his Pamphila, points\n out the useful properties of the polypus, speaking as follows,\u2014 \n But if you are in love, O Cteson, \n What is more useful than these fish I bring? \n Ceryces, cockles, (onions too, are here,) \n The mighty polypus, and good-sized turbot. \n \n The pelamys also is very nutritious and heavy, it is also diuretic, and\n very indigestible; but when cured like the callubium, it is quite as good for\n the stomach, and it has a tendency to make the blood thin; and the large kind\n is called the synodontis. The sea-swallow, or chelidonias, is also something\n like the pelamys, but harder; and the chelidon is like the polypus, and emits\n juice which purifies the complexion, and stirs up the blood. The orcynus is a\n fish who delights in the mud; and the larger kind is like the chelidonias in\n hardness, but the lower part of its abdomen and its collar-bone are palatable\n and tender; but those which are called cost\u00e6, when cured and salted, are a\n middling fish. The xanthias has rather a strong smell, and is tenderer than the\n orcynus. These are the statements of Diphilus. \n ","53":"\n But Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on Eatables, says,\u2014\"The larger breed\n of fishes are called by some sectile, and by others sea-fish; as, for instance,\n the chrysophrys, the sea-grayling, and the phagrus. And these are all difficult of\n digestion, but when they are digested they supply a great deal of nourishment. And\n the whole class of scaly fish, such as the thynni, the scombri, the tunnies, the\n congers, and all of those kinds, are also gregarious. But those which are not seen\n by themselves, nor in large shoals, are the most\n digestible, such as the congers, and the carcharie, and fish of that kind. But the\n gregarious kinds of fish of that sort are very pleasant to the palate, for they\n are fat; but they are heavy, ad difficult of digestion, on which account they are\n very good for curing; and, indeed, these kinds make the best cured fish of all;\n they are also very good roasted, for by that process their fatty parts are got rid\n of. But those kinds which are skinned before they are dressed, as a general rule,\n are those fish which have a rough outside to their skin, not of scales, but such\n as rays and rhino have. And all these kinds are easily divided into small pieces,\n but they have not a sweet smell. And they supply the body with plenty of moist\n nourishment, and of all boiled fish they have the greatest effect on the bowels;\n but when they are roasted they are not so good. And the whole class of molluscous\n fish, such as polypi and cuttlefish, and others like them, are very indigestible,\n on which account they are very serviceable in exciting the amatory passions. They\n are also calculated to cause flatulence; and the time of indulgence in amatory\n pleasures requires a flatulent habit of body. All these fish are better when\n boiled. For their juices are injurious, and you may see what juices they emit when\n they are washed; and the boiling extracts all these juices from their flesh. For\n as the heat which is applied in boiling is a gradual one, and conjoined with\n moisture, there is, as it were, a sort of washing of them. But when they are\n roasted, that dries up the moisture, and moreover, as their flesh is hard by\n nature, it is natural that it should be made more so in this way. \n ","54":"\n \u201cBut anchovies of all kinds, and membrades, and trichides, and all the other\n little fish which we eat backbones and all, make the digestion flatulent, and give\n a good deal of moist nutriment. And so, as the digestion is unequal, the flesh\n being digested with great rapidity, and the bones dissolving slowly, for the\n anchovies are very bony of themselves, the digestion of the one part hinders the\n digestion of the other, and so flatulence arises from the digestion, ad moisture\n comes from the quantity of nourishment. They are better when they are boiled, but\n still they have very unequal effects on the bowels. The fish which keep close to\n the rocks, such as tench, and scorpions, and sea-sparrows, and others of the same\n kind, supply a dry kind of nourishment to our bodies, but \n they are light and nutritious, and are easily digested, and leave nothing behind\n them, and are not apt to cause flatulence. And every kind of fish is more\n digestible when dressed simply, and especially those which keep near the rocks\n have a better flavour when dressed plainly. And the species which is called\n soft-fleshed is like them, namely, the sea-thrush, the sea-blackbird, and others\n which resemble them. And these contain more moisture than the others, and with\n respect to refreshing the strength of those who eat them, they have more efficacy.\n And if any one wishes to produce an effect upon his bowels, he should eat them\n boiled; but if he is in good health, then he will find them nutritious roasted.\n And as diuretic food they are equally useful cooked either way. \n ","55":"\n \n But the places of the sea where rivers and lakes fall into it, and also\n those where there are large bays and gulfs of the sea, are those where all the\n fish are more juicy, and more full of fat. They are also more palatable when\n caught in those places, but less nutritious and less digestible. And on the\n shore where it is exposed to the open sea, and where it is unprotected, then\n the fishes found there are for the most part hard and thin, beaten by the\n continued action of the waves. But where the sea is deep close in shore and\n less exposed to violent winds, especially if there are any cities near, then\n there is the greatest number of fish, and they are equally excellent in respect\n of pleasantness of flavour and ease of digestion, and also in the nourishment\n which they afford to the body. But of sea fish those are the most indigestible\n and the heaviest which migrate at certain seasons from the sea to the lakes and\n rivers; such as the cestreus; and as a general rule that is the character of\n every fish which can live in both salt and fresh water. But of those which live\n wholly in rivers and lakes, the river fish are the best; for the water of lakes\n is more apt to putrefy. And, again, of river fish those are the best which are\n found in the most rapid rivers; and especially the trout; for those are never\n found except where the river is rapid and cold, and they are far superior to\n all other river fish in their digestible properties. \n \n ","56":"\n This now, my friends, is my contribution, and I have brought you the wholesomest\n food with which it was in my power to provide you. For, as you may read in the\n Parasite of Antiphanes,\u2014 \n \n For I have never taken any great trouble \n In buying fish; * * \n * * * * * \n * * So that others from rich banquets coming \n Should blame the gluttonous surfeits of their friends. \n And, indeed, I myself am not so violently fond of fish as the man in the\n Butalion of the same poet. (And that play is an amended edition of one of the\n Countryman's characters.) And he says\u2014 \n \n A. And I to-day will give a feast to all of you; \n And take you money now, and buy the supper. \n \n B. Yes; for unless I've money I should hardly \n Know how to buy discreetly. But i' the first place, \n Tell me what food, what dishes you prefer. \n \n A. All kinds of food. \n \n B. But tell me separately. \n First now, should you approve of any fish? \n \n A. A fishmonger came once into the country \n With a good basketfull of sprats and triglides, \n And, by Jove, greatly he pleased all of us. \n \n B. Well, tell me then, should you now like some\n fish? \n \n A. Indeed I should, if they were very little. \n For all large fish I always fancy cannibals. \n \n B. What can you mean, my friend? \n \n A. Why, cannibals;\u2014 \n How can a man eat fish which eat up men! \n \n B. 'Tis plain enough that it is Helen's food \n This fellow means, just sprats and triglides. \n And in his Countryman he also calls sprats and triglides the food of\n Hecate. And Ephippus too, disparaging small fish, in his Philyra, speaks as\n follows\u2014 \n \n A. My father, would you like to go to market \n And buy some fish for me \n \n B. What shall I buy? \n \n A. Some grown up fish, my father, no small\n babies. \n \n B. Do not you yet know all the worth of money? \n \n \n ","57":"\n And in the same poet, in his Spit-bearers, there is a very witty young man who\n disparages everything connected with the purchase of fish. And he speaks thus\u2014\n \n \n A. But while you buy, don't disregard economy, \n For anything will do. \n \n B. Just tell me how. \n \n A. Don't be expensive, though not mean or\n stingy; \n Whatever you may buy will be enough; \n Some squids and cuttle-fish; and should there be \n Some lobsters in the market, let's have one\u2014 \n Some eels will look nice too upon the table\u2014 \n \n Especially if from the Theban lake: \n Then let us have a cock, a tender pigeon, \n A partridge, and a few such other things; \n And if a hare should offer, then secure it. \n \n B. Why how precise you are in your directions! \n \n A. I'd need be, you are so extravagant; \n And we are certain to have meat enough. \n \n B. Has anybody sent you any present? \n \n A. No, but my wife has sacrificed the calf \n Which from Corone came, and we to-morrow \n Shall surely sup on it. \n And in Mnesimachus, the Morose Man, in the play of the same name, being a\n great miser, says to the extravagant young man in the play\u2014 \n \n A. I do entreat you, do not lecture me \n So very fiercely; do not say so much \n About the money; recollect I'm your uncle; \n Be moderate, I beg. \n \n B. How can I be \n More moderate than I am? \n \n A. At least be briefer, \n And don't deceive me; use diminutives; \n For fish say fishlings; if you want aught more, \n Speak of your bits of dishes; and at least \n I shall be ruin'd with a better grace. \n \n \n ","58":"\n But since, as fortune would have it so, in the before quoted lines,\u2014my excellent\n Ulpian, or you too, O you sons of grammarians, just tell me what was Ephippus's\n meaning in what I have just repeated, when he said\u2014 \n The calf \n Which from Corone came, and we\n to-morrow \n Shall surely sup on it. \n For I think there is here an allusion to some historical fact, and I\n should like to understand it. And Plutarch said, \u2014There is a Rhodian tale, which,\n however, I can hardly repeat at the moment, because it is a very long time since I\n have fallen in with the book in which it occurs. But I know that Ph\u0153nix the\n Colophonian, the Iambic poet, making mention of some men as collecting money for\n the Jackdaw, speaks as follows\u2014 \n My friends, I pray you give a handful now \n Of barley to the jackdaw, Ph\u0153bus' daughter; \n \n Or else a plate of wheat; or else a loaf, \n A halfpenny, or whatsoe'er you please; \n Give, my good friends, whatever you can spare \n To the poor jackdaw; e'en a grain of salt; \n For willingly she feeds on anything; \n And he who salt bestows to-day, to-morrow \n May give some honey. Open, boy, the door; \n Plutus has heard, and straight a serving maid \n Brings out some figs. Gods, let that maiden be \n For ever free from harm, and may she find \n A wealthy husband of distinguished name: \n And may she show unto her aged father \n A lusty boy, and on her mother's lap \n Place a fair girl, her daughter, to bring up \n A happy helpmate for some lucky cousin. \n But I, where'er my feet conduct my eyes, \n Sing with alternate melody at the gates \n Of him who gives, and him who rude denies. \n At present I'll leave off, and say no more. \n And at the end of this set of iambics he says\u2014 \n But you, my friends, who have good store at home, \n Give something. Give, O king; give you too, housewife. \n It is the law that all should give their hand \n When the crow begs. And you who know this law, \n Give what you please, and it shall be sufficient. \n And those people who went about collecting for the jackdaw ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 ) were called Coronist\u00e6, as Pamphilus of\n Alexandria tells us, in his treatise on Names. And the songs which are sung by\n them are called coronismata, as Agnocles the Rhodian tells us, in his\n Coronist\u00e6. \n ","59":"\n There is also another collection made among the Rhodians, the making of which is\n called \u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd; and it is mentioned by\n Theognis, in the second book of his treatise on the Sacrifices in Rhodes, where he\n writes thus\u2014\"There is a species of collecting which the Rhodians call \u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, which takes place in the month Boedromion.\n And it derives its name of \u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd because\n the people are accustomed to utter the following song:\u2014 \n The swallow, the swallow ( \u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd ) is\n come, \n Bringing good seasons and a joyful time. \n Her belly is white, her back is black. \n Bring, oh bring, a cake of figs \n Out of your luxurious house, \n Bring a cup of wine, \n And a dish of cheese, \n And a bag of wheat. \n \n Those the good swallow will not despise, \n Nor a cake of eggs. \n Shall we now go, or shall we get something? \n Give something, and we'll go; if you give nothing \n We will not cease to pester you; we'll force the door \n And carry it away, or th' upper lintel, \n Or e'en your wife who sits within the house. \n She is but little, we shall find her light. \n If you give something, let it be worth having. \n Open, then, open the door to the swallow, \n For we are not old men, but only boys. \n And Cleobulus the Lindian was the first man who introduced the custom of\n this collection, at a time when there was a great want in Lindus of a collection\n of money. \n ","60":"\n But, since we have mentioned the Rhodian histories, I myself am now going to tell\n you something about fish, from the account given of the beautiful Rhodes, which\n that delightful writer Lynceus says is full of excellent fish. Ergias the Rhodian,\n then, in his Account of his own Country, having first made mention of the\n Phoenicians, who inhabited the island, says\u2014\"That Phalanthus, and his friends,\n having a very strong city in Ialysus, called Achaia, and being very economical of\n their provisions, held out for a long time against Iphiclus, who besieged them.\n For they had also a prophecy given them by some oracle, that they should keep the\n place till crows became white, and till fish were seen in their goblets. They\n therefore, expecting that these things would never happen, prosecuted the war with\n less vigour. But Iphiclus, having heard from some one of the oracles of the\n Ph\u0153nicians, and having waylaid a highly-trusted adherent of Phalanthus, whose name\n was Larcas, as he was going for water, and having entered into a covenant with\n him, caught some fish at the spring, and putting them into the ewer, gave them to\n Larcas, and bade him carry the water back, and pour it into the goblet from which\n he was used to pour out wine for Phalanthus: and he did so. And Iphiclus also\n caught some crows, and smeared them over with gypsum, and let them fly again. But\n when Phalanthus saw the crows, he went to his goblet; and when he saw the fish\n there, he considered that the place no longer belonged to him and his party, and\n so he sent a herald to Iphiclus, demanding permission to retire, with all his\n troops, under the protection of a treaty, And when Iphiclus agreed to this,\n Phalanthus devised the follow- ing contrivance. Having slain\n some victims, and taken out the entrails, he endeavoured to put in some silver and\n gold, and so to carry it away. But when Iphiclus percieved this, he prevented it.\n And when Phalanthus alleged against him the oath which he had taken, when he swore\n to allow them to take away whatever they had in their bellies, he met them with a\n counter device, giving them vessels to go away in, but taking away the rudders,\n and the oars, and the sails, saying that he had sworn to give them boats, and\n nothing further. And as the Ph\u0153nicians were in great perplexity, they buried a\n great deal of their riches underground, marking the places where they buried it,\n that at some future time they might come and take it up again; but they left a\n great deal for Iphiclus. And so, when the Ph\u0153nicians had left the place in this\n manner, the Greeks became masters of it.\u201d And Polyzelus has given the same\n account, in his History of Rhodian Affairs; and says\u2014 That the only people\n who knew the secret about the fishes and the crows were Phaces and his daughter\n Dorcia; and she, being beloved by Iphiclus, and having come to an agreement to\n marry him through the intervention of her nurse, persuaded the man who brought\n the water to bring the fish and put them into the goblet; and she herself\n whitewashed the crows, and let them go. \n \n ","61":"\n And Creophylus, in his Annals of the Ephesians, says\u2014 Those who colonized\n Ephesus, being much perplexed for want of a place where they could settle, sent\n at last to the oracle, and asked where they should build themselves a city; and\n he told them to build a city in that place which a fish should show them, and\n to which a wild boar should guide them. Accordingly, it is said that some\n fishermen were breakfasting at the spot where the fountain called Hypeleus now\n is, and where the harbour is which is called the sacred harbour; and that one\n of the fish leaped up with a burning cinder sticking to him, and fell on some\n of the refuse; and that by this means a thicket was set on fire, in which there\n happened to be a wild boar; and he, being disturbed by the fire ran for some\n distance up the mountain which is called th Rough Mountain, and at last was\n transfixed by javelins, and fell where the temple of Minerva now stands. And\n the Ephesians, having crossed over from the island, occupied that for\n twenty-one years, and in the twenty-second year they founded Trachea and the\n towns around Coressus, and erected a temple to Diana in\n the market-place, and one to the Pythian Apollo overlooking the\n harbour. \n \n ","62":"\n Now after this long conversation, all of a sudden there was heard all over the\n city the music of flutes and the noise of cymbals, and also a great crash of\n drums, with singing at the same time. And it happened to be the time of a festival\n which used formerly to be called the Parilia, but which is now called the Romana,\n in honour of the temple built to the Fortune of the City, by that most excellent\n and accomplished sovereign Hadrian. And all the inhabitants of Rome (and all the\n foreigners sojourning in the city) every year keep that day as a remarkable one.\n Accordingly, Ulpian said,\u2014My friends, what is this?\u2014 \n Is it a supper or a marriage feast \n For certainly there is no picnic held now. \n And when some one replied that every one in the city was dancing (using\n the verb \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 ) in honour of the goddess, \u2014My\n fine fellow, said Ulpian, laughing, what Greek in the world ever called this\n dancing \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3?

Epicharmus, my most excellent gentlemen, in his Theori,\n speaks of the \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2, and Italy is no great way\n from Sicily. Accordingly, in that play, the public ambassadors, surveying the\n offerings at Pytho, and mentioning each one separately, speak as follows:\u2014 \n Here there are brazen caldrons, brazen goblets, \n And spits. And then to see the men with spits \n And flutes, too, dancing ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ), what\n a sight it was! \n And Sophron, in his play which is entitled Nymphoponus, says\u2014 \n Then he did take it, and proceeded onwards; \n The rest did follow dancing ( \u1f10\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And again he says\u2014 \n Dancing ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ) they filled the\n entrance room with dung. \n \n And Alexis, in his Curis, says\u2014 \n And now I see a multitude of men \n Hastening to a feast, as if a goodly company \n Were here invited. May it be my luck \n To keep out of your way, my revellers, \n After your dancing ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 ) and your\n feasting both \n Have gone off well and are quite finish'd. \n For I should never bear my robe off safely, \n Unless my wings had grown. \n I know, too, that the word is found in other places, and when I recollect\n the exact passage, I will bring it forward. \n ","63":"\n But we have a right to ask of you, who have quoted to us these lines out of Homer,\n \n But say, you joyful troop so gaily drest, \n Is this a bridal or a friendly feast?\u2014 \n in what respect the different sorts of feasts, which he calls \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 and \u1f14\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \n differ from one another? But, since you are silent, I will tell you; for, as the\n poet of Syracuse says,\u2014 \n I by myself am equal to the task \n Which formerly it took two men to answer. \n The ancients used to call sacrifices, and the more splendid kind of\n preparations, \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03ac\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; and those who partook of\n them they used to call \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af. But those\n feasts they called \u1f14\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, the materials for which\n were contributed by all who joined in them; and this name was derived from all the\n guests being friendly together ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb7\u03bd )\n and contributing. And this same \u1f14\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is also\n called \u03b8\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, and those who partake of it are\n called \u1f10\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76 and \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. The crowd, also, which follows Bacchus in his festivals\n is called \u03b8\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, as Euripides says\u2014 \n I see three thiasi of women coming. \n And they gave them the name \u03b8\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 from\n the word \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2; \u2014 and, indeed, the Laced\u00e6monian form\n of the word \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 is \u03c3\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2. And the word \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 is\n derived from the preparation and expense gone to for such purposes; for being\n destructive and extravagant is called \u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n \u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, from which words the poets have used the word \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 for to destroy, And the plunder which is carried\n off after the sacking of a city they call \u03bb\u03ac\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1. \n And accordingly Aeschylus and Eripides have given to the more luxurious banquets\n the name of \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03ac\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, from the verb \u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9. There is also a verb, \u03bb\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9, \n which means to digest one's food, and to become relaxed\n ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 ) by becoming empty. And from this word\n \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 we get the word \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd (the flank), and also \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \n (a thin, broad cake); and from the word \u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9 we\n get \u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 (the loins). And the verb \u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9 means, with great freedom and abundance to\n evacuate and erupt oneself. And the word \u03b4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 \n (to spend) is derived from \u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9; and \u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 is akin to \u03b4\u03b1\u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2; on which account we find the verbs \u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 and \u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 applied to those\n who eat in a voracious and savage manner. Homer says\u2014 \n Him the fierce dogs and hungry vultures tore ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03b4\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1\u03bd ). \n But the word \u03b5\u1f50\u03c9\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 (a luxurious feast)\n is derived not from \u1f40\u03c7\u1f74, which means nutriment,\n but from everything going on well ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b5\u1f56\n \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ) in such a banquet, in which those who assemble honour the\n deity, and give themselves up to mirth and relaxation; and from this relaxation\n ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ) they call wine \u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5, and the god who gave them wine they call\n Methymnaeus, and Ly\u00e6us, and Evius, and Icius; just as also they call a man who is\n not sullen-looking and morose \u1f31\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2; on which\n account, too, they pray the deity to be propitious ( \u1f35\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 ), uttering the ejaculation \u1f30\u1f74,\n \u1f30\u03ae. And from this again they call the place where they do this\n \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd. And that they meant very nearly the same\n thing by \u1f35\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 and \u1f31\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 is plain from the language used by Ephippus, in his play\n entitled Traffic; for he is speaking of a courtesan, and he says\u2014 \n Then too, when any one is out of humour, \n When he comes in she flatters him discreetly, \n And kisses him, not pressing his mouth hard \n Like some fierce enemy; but just billing towards him \n Like some fond sparrow; then she sings and comforts him, \n And makes him cheerful ( \u1f31\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 ) and dispels\n all clouds \n From off his face, and renders him propitious ( \u1f35\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 ). \n \n \n ","64":"\n But the ancients, who represented the gods under the form of men, arranged all\n their festivals on a similar principle; for, seeing that it is not possible to\n divert men from an eagerness for pleasure, but that it is useful and expedient to\n accustom them to enjoy themselves with moderation and in an orderly manner, they\n set apart certain times, and, sacrificing first to the gods, they in this way\n permitted them relaxation and enjoyment, in order that every one, thinking that\n the gods had come among them, and were present at the \n firstfruits and libations, might enjoy himself with order and decency. Accordingly\n Homer says\u2014 \n There, too, was Pallas to partake the feast: \n and Neptune, too, is represented thus\u2014 \n The monarch of the main, a heavenly guest, \n In Ethiopia graced the genial feast, \n There on the world's extremest verge, revered \n With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr'd, \n Distant he lay: \u2014 \n and of Jupiter he says\u2014 \n The sire of gods and all the ethereal train \n On the warm limits of the furthest main \n Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace \n The feast of Ethiopia's blameless race. \n \n And if a man of more mature age, and devoted to wise and virtuous\n pursuits, is present, they are ashamed to say or do anything indecorous; as also\n Epicharmus says, somewhere or other:\u2014 \n But when their aged superiors are present, \n Young men should silent be. \n Therefore, considering that the gods were near to them, they celebrated\n their festivals in an orderly and temperate man- ner; on which account it was not\n the fashion of the ancients to lie at their meals, but, as Homer says,\u2014 \n Feasting they sate; \n nor were they accustomed to drink to the extent of drunkenness\u2014 \n But when they'd eaten thus, and drank their fill, \n Each to his room retired, not dreaming ill. \n \n \n ","65":"\n But the men of modern times, pretending to be sacrificing to the gods, and\n inviting their friends and nearest kinsmen to the sacrifice, vent imprecations on\n their children, and abuse their wives, and treat their slaves with indignity, and\n threaten the multitude, almost verifying the line of Homer:\u2014 \n But now with speed let's take a short repast, \n And well refresh'd to bloody conflict haste. \n Nor do they ever give a thought to what has been said by the poet who\n wrote the poem entitled Chiron, whether it is Pherecrates, or Nicomachus, the\n teacher of rhythm, or whatever else his name may have been:\u2014 \n \n When you have ask'd a friend to come to supper, \n Do not be angry when you see him come; \n That is the part of an unworthy man; \n But give yourself to happy thoughts of joy, \n And study to amuse your friend and guest. \n But now men utterly forget all these rules, and they recollect only the\n lines which follow them, which are all written in imitation of the Great Eo\u00e6 which\n are attributed to Hesiod, and which are also meant as a parody on his great work,\n Works and Days:\u2014 \n When any of us does celebrate \n A sacrifice, and bids his friends to th' feast, \n Still, if he come, we're vex'd and look askance, \n And wish him to depart without delay. \n And he his want of welcome soon perceives \n And reassumes his shoes; when some one rises \n Of the surrounding revellers, and says, \n \"Here, my friend, do not go; why won't you drink. \n Take off your shoes.\" And then the host again \n Is angry with the guest who calls him back, \n And quotes some scraps of poetry against him,\u2014 \n \"Remember, always speed the parting guest, \n And when a man is sleeping let him rest.\" \n Do not we in this manner oft behave \n When feasting those we choose to call our friends? \n And, moreover, we add this:\u2014 \n Let not a numerous party vex your mind, \n For more are pleased, and the cost's near the same. \n \n \n ","66":"\n And when we are sacrificing to the gods, we spend as little as possible upon our\n sacrifices, and give them the most ordinary presents; as the admirable Menander\n tells us, in his Drunkenness:\u2014 \n We don't do other things as we perform \n Our duties to the gods. We sacrifice \n One sheep scarce worth ten or a dozen drachm\u00e6; \n But for our flute-women, our perfumes rich, \n Our harpers, Thasian and Mend\u00e6an wine, \n Eels, cheese, and honey to regale ourselves, \n We do not a whole talent think too much. \n 'Tis very well to spend a dozen drachm\u00e6 \n When we are sacrificing to the gods, \n But if you much curtail that slight expense, \n Are you not thus dishonouring the gods? \n I, if I were a god, would ne'er allow \n A scanty loin of beef to load my altars, \n Unless an eel were also sacrificed, \n So that Callimedon might die of rage. \n \n \n \n ","67":"\n And the ancients call some feasts \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1, that\n is to say, given into the bargain,\u2014the same which the Alexandrians call \u1f10\u03be \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd. Alexis, at all events, in his Woman at\n the Well, says\u2014 \n \n A. And now the master here has sent a slave \n To bring to me a jar of his own wine. \n \n B. I understand; this is \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \n \n A gift into the bargain, as a makeweight; \n I praise the wise old woman. \n And Crobylus, in his Supposititious Son, says\u2014 \n \n A. Laches, I come to you; proceed. \n \n B. Which way? \n \n A. How can you ask? Why, to my mistress, who \n Has a feast \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 prepared; \n And in her honour only yesterday \n You made the guests drink down twelve glasses each. \n The ancients, also, were acquainted with the banquets which are now\n called dole-basket banquets; and Pherecrates mentions them in his Forgetful Man,\n or the Sea, saying\u2014 \n Having prepared a small dole-basket supper \n He went away to Ophela. \n And this clearly points to the dole-basket supper, when a man prepares a\n supper for himself, and then puts it in a basket, and goes off to sup with some\n one. And Lysias has used the word \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd for a\n banquet, in his speech against Micinus, on his trial for murder; for he says that\n he had been invited to a \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd : and Plato\n says\u2014 Those who had made a \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd : and Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, says\u2014 \n Praising great Aeschylus in his \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1, \n \n on which account some people wish to write the title of Sophocles's play\n in the neuter gender, \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd.

I'll come and bring my contributions now. \n \n B. How, contributions? \n \n A. The Chalcidians \n Call fringes, alabaster, scent boxes, \n And other things of that kind, contributions. \n But the Argives, as Hegesander tells us in his Commentaries, (the\n following are his exact words)\u2014 The Argives call the contributions towards\n an entertainment which are brought by the revellers, \u03c7\u1ff6\u03bd; and each man's share they call \u03b1\u1f36\u03c3\u03b1. \n \n \n ","68":"\n And now, since this book also has come to a not unsuitable end, my good friend\n Timocrates, let us stop our discussion at this point, lest any one should think\n that we were formerly fishes ourselves, as Empedocles says that he was; for that\n great natural philosopher says\u2014 \n For I myself have been a boy, a girl, \n A bush, a bird, and fish which roams the sea. \n \n \n "},"8":{"0":"\n \n \n But now let each becalm his troubled breast, \n Wash, and partake serene the friendly feast; \n While to renew these topics we delay \n Till Heaven's revolving lamp restores the day, \n both to you and me, O Timocrates.

But it is a line out of\n the Knights, and it ought to be read thus\u2014 \n \n \u03ba\u1f04\u03b2\u03bb\u03b5\u03c8\u03b5 \u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c5, not \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c5 : \n for no Attic writer ever used the form \u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c5, although there is a reason for each form. For \u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c5 may be said, as if it were \u03bd\u03ac\u03c6\u03c5, because it has no \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, or\n growth. Fr it is \u1f00\u03c6\u03c5\u1f72\u03c2 and little, like the\n anchovy, which is called \u1f00\u03c6\u03cd\u03b7, and is called\n \u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c5, because it injures the eyes ( \u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f66\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 ) by its smell, as\n the onion has the name of \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bc\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd, because it\n makes us wink our eyes ( \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ). And\n Xenarchus the comic writer says, in his Scythians\u2014 \n This evil is no longer evil; so \n My daughter is corrupted by the stranger. \n And that exquisite writer, Aristophanes, mentions salt and vinegar,\n saying, in the place where he speaks of Sthenelus the tragedian,\u2014 \n \n A. How can I swallow Sthenelus's words? \n \n B. By soaking them in vinegar or white salt. \n \n \n ","2":"\n We then, my good friend, have gone along with you in these inquiries. But we have\n a right to expect an answer from you, in what author the word \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u1f76\u03c2 is used for a vessel. For when speaking of some\n victuals of various sorts, which were carefully dressed, and of some other things\n of this sort, I am aware that Plato, in his Festivals, has used the following\n expressions\u2014 \n Whence barley-cakes might be got, and \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n And again, in his Europa, speaking at considerable length of some\n exquisite dish, he has used the following expressions among others\u2014 \n \n A.

For the philosopher says, They brought him \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, and condiments of all sorts, and food of\n all kinds.

For he says\u2014 \n By Jove, as \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 are praised or\n blamed \n Because of the way in which they flavour meat, \n So Caletas esteems these people nothing. \n And Nicophon, in his Sirens, says\u2014 \n Others may fight the \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u1f76\u03c2 for their\n seat. \n And Aristophanes says, in his D\u00e6dalus,\u2014 \n All women have one set of principles, \n And have a lover, like a \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u1f76\u03c2, ready. \n \n And Plato says, in his Festivals,\u2014 \n Whence barley-cakes may be got, and \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n But he is speaking here of cooking and seasoning onions. But the Attic\n writers, O my Syri-Attic friend Ulpian, use \u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 also in this sense; as Theopompus says, in his Peace:\u2014\n \n Bread's a good thing; but flattery and tricks, \n When added as a seasoning ( \u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 ) to\n bread, \n Are odious as can be. \n \n \n ","5":"\n When speaking of hams, they use the two forms \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 \n and \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd. Eupolis, in his Autolycus, says\u2014 \n The legs and hams ( \u03ba\u1ff3\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b5\u03c2 ) out of the\n soup. \n And Euripides, in his Sciron, says\u2014 \n Nor hams ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) of kids. \n But the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 is contracted from\n \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, as \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6 \n from \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03ad\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1fc6 from \u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03b1; so \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 from \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1. Aristophanes, in his second Plutus, says\u2014 \n Alas the ham ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 ) which I have just\n devour'd! \n And in his Daitaleis he says\u2014 \n And the fat hams ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76 ) of tender little\n pigs \n And dainty tit-bits swift to fly. \n And in his Storks he says\u2014 \n The heads of lambs, the hams ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1f70\u03c2 ) of\n kids. \n And Plato, in his Griffins, says\u2014 \n Fish, and hams ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1f70\u03c2 ), and sausages. \n And Ameipsias, in his Connus, says\u2014 \n The ham ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 ) from off the victim, and the\n ribs, \n And the left side o' th' head are usually given. \n And Xenophon, in his book on Hunting, says\u2014 The ham ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 ) is fleshy, and the loins moist. And\n Xenophanes the Colophonian, in his Elegies, says\u2014 \n For having sent a ham ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03bb\u1fc6 ) of kid, you\n won \n A mighty leg of carefully fatted bull, \n An honourable present for a man, \n Whose glory shall pervade all Greece, and never \n Cease while the poets and the songs of Greece \n Survive in memory and the mouths of men. \n \n \n ","6":"\n And as immediately after this a great quantity of food of all sorts was brought\n in, we will just mention those dishes which seem most worthy of being remembered;\n for there was a great quantity of birds, and of geese, and\n also of young birds (which some people call \u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 ), and of pigs, and of those highly-esteemed birds the pheasants.\n And after I have told you about the vegetables, I will then enumerate to you the\n other dishes also. \n ","7":"\n First of all, there were turnips; and Apellas in his treatise on the Cities in\n Peloponnesus, says that turnips are called \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 by the Laced\u00e6monians: and Nicander the Colophonian, in his\n Dialects, says that among the B\u0153otians it is cabbages which are called \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, and that turnips are called in B\u0153otia \u03b6\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. But Amerias and Timachidas affirm that it is\n gourds which are called \u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. And\n Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things resembling one another,\n says\u2014 The radish, the turnip, the rape, and the nasturtium all resemble\n each other. But Glaucus, in his Cookery Book, spells the word \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03c5\u03c2 (rape) with the lene \u03c0, \u2014 \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c0\u03c5\u03c2. But these vegetables have\n nothing else like them, unless, indeed, it be the plant which we call bounias: but\n Theophrastus does not use the name of bounias, but calls it a sort of male turnip;\n and perhaps the plant which he means is the bounias. And Nicander, in his\n Georgics, mentions the bounias\u2014 \n Sow turnips on a well-roll'd field, that they \n May grow as large as the flat dish that holds them, \n * * * * \n . . . . . For there are two kinds \n Which from the radish spring: one long, one firm, \n Both seen in well-till'd beds in kitchen gardens. \n And the turnips which grow on the banks of the Cephisus are mentioned by\n Cratis, in his Orators, thus\u2014 \n And wholly like the turnips of Cephisus. \n \n \n But Theophrastus says that there are two kinds of turnips, the male and the\n female, and that they both come from the same seed; but Posidonius the Stoic\n philosopher, in the twenty-seventh book of his Histories, concerning Dalmatia,\n says that there are some turnips which grow without any cultivation, and also some\n carrots that grow wild. But Diphilus the physician, of Siphnos, says\u2014 The\n turnip has attenuating properties, and is harsh and indigestible, and moreover\n is apt to cause flatulence: but the vegetable called bounias is superior to\n that; for it is sweeter in taste and more digestible, in\n addition to being wholesome for the sto- mach and nutritious. But the\n turnip, he says, when roasted, is more easily digested, but in\n this state it attenuates the blood still more. This vegetable is\n mentioned by Eubulus, in his Ancylion, where he says\u2014 \n I bring this turnip to be roasted now. \n And Alexis, in his Enthusiast, says\u2014 \n I speak to Ptolemy, roasting slices of turnip. \n But the turnip, when pickled, is more attenuating in its effects than\n when boiled, especially when it is pickled with mustard, as Diphilus says. \n ","8":"\n Then there was the cabbage. Eudemus the Athenian, in his treatise on Vegetables,\n says that there are three kinds of cabbage\u2014the kind called the salt-cabbage, and\n the smooth-leaved-cabbage, and the parsley-cabbage: and that the salt-cabbage is\n reckoned the finest of all in respect of its delicacy of taste; and it grows in\n Eretria, and Cyme, and Rhodes, and also in Cnidos and Ephesus: but the\n smooth-leaved kind is found in every country; and the parsley-cabbage has its name\n from the curly nature of its leaves, for it is like parsley, both in that respect\n and in its general thickness. But Theophrastus writes thus\u2014 But of the,\n \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2,\u2014 I mean the cabbage,\u2014there is one\n kind with curly leaves, and another with smooth leaves, and a third which is\n wild. And Diphilus the Siphnian says\u2014 The finest and most\n delicious cabbage grows in Cyme; in Alexandria it is bitter; and the seed which\n is brought from Rhodes to Alexandria produces sweet cabbage for one year, after\n which time it degenerates again, from the nature of the soil. And\n Nicander, in his Georgics, says\u2014 \n The smooth-leaved cabbage sometimes wild is found, \n And then the curly many-leaved plants \n Are often sown in beds; . . . . . . . \n There is another kind, of reddish colour, \n Like frogs in drought; some of bad colour too \n Do come from Cyme, like the dingy soles \n Which cobblers often sew on worn-out boots; \n And these the ancients do the Prophets call \n But perhaps Nicander calls the cabbage Prophet, as being sacred; since in\n Hipponax, in his Iambics, we find some such lines as these,\u2014 \n He falling down worshipp'd the seven-leaved cabbage, \n To which, before she drank the poison'd draught, \n Pandora brought a cake at the Thargelia. \n \n And Ananius says\u2014 \n And, by the cabbage do I swear, I love thee \n By far the most of mortal men . . . \n And Teleclides, in his Prytanes, uses the oath, Yes, by the\n cabbages and Epicharmus has the same exclamation in his Earth and Sea;\n and so has Eupolis, in his Dyer; and it appears to have been an Ionian oath: and\n there is nothing very strange in the fact of some people having sworn by the\n cabbage, since Zeno the Citti\u00e6an, the founder of the sect of the Stoics, imitating\n the oath of Socrates, by the bitch, was used himself to swear\n by the caper, as Empodus relates in his Memorabilia. \n ","9":"\n And at Athens the cabbage used to be given to women who had just been delivered,\n as a sort of medicine, having a tendency to add to their nourishment. Accordingly,\n Ephippus, in his Geryones, says\u2014 \n What shall next be done? \n There is no garland now before the doors, \n No savoury smell strikes on my nostril's edge \n From Amphidromian festival, in which \n The custom is to roast large bits of cheese, \n Such as the Chersonesus furnishes, \n And then to boil a radish bright with oil, \n And fry the breasts of well-fed household Iamb, \n And to pluck pigeons, thrushes too, and finches, \n And to eat squids and cuttle-fish together, \n And many polypi with wondrous curls, \n And to quaff many goblets of pure wine. \n And Antiphanes, in his Parasite, speaks of the cabbage as an economical\n food, in the following lines, where he says\u2014 \n And what these things are, you, my wife, know well; \n Garlic, and cheese, and cheese-cakes, dainty dishes \n Fit for a gentleman; no fish cured and salted, \n No joints of lamb well stuff'd with seasoning, \n No forced meat of all kinds of ingredients; \n No high made dishes, fit to kill a man; \n But they will boil some cabbage sweet, ye gods! \n And in the dish with it some pulse of pease. \n And Diphilus says, in his Insatiable Man,\u2014 \n All sorts of dainties now come round us here, \n All of their own accord. There's cabbage fresh, \n Well boil'd in oil; and many paunches, and \n Dishes of tender meat. No . . . . by Jove, \n Nor are they like my platters of bruised olives \n \n And Alc\u00e6us, in his Pal\u00e6stra, says\u2014 \n And now she's roasted a large dish of cabbage. \n And Polyzelus, in his Birth of the Muses, names cabbages; and says\u2014\n \n The close-grown cabbage with its lofty leaves. \n \n \n ","10":"\n The next thing to be mentioned is beet-root. Of beetroot (according to the opinion\n of Theophrastus), the white is more juicy than the black, and it contains less\n seed, and it is the kind which is called the Sicilian beet. But, says he, the beet\n called \u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03bb\u1f76\u03c2 is a different kind from the\n \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. On which account, Diphilus the comic\n poet, in his drama called the Hero, reproaches some one for speaking incorrectly,\n and for calling \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2. And Eudemus, in\n his treatise on Vegetables, says that there are four kinds of \u03c4\u03b5\u1f56\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1 : there is the kind which may be pulled, the kind\n with a stalk, the white kind, and the common kind; and this last is of a brown\n colour. But Diphilus the Siphnian says that the beet which he calls \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd is more juicy than the cabbage, and is also, in\n a moderate degree, more nutritious; and it ought to be boiled and eaten with\n mustard, and that then it has a tendency to attenuate the blood, and to destroy\n worms; but the white kind is better for the stomach, while the black is more\n diuretic. He says, also, that their roots are more pleasing to the palate, and\n more nutritious. \n ","11":"\n Then there is the carrot. This vegetable, says Diphilus, is\n harsh, but tolerably nutritious, and moderately good for the stomach; but it\n passes quickly through the bowels, and causes flatulence: it is indigestible,\n diuretic, and not without some influence in prompting men to amatory feelings;\n on which account it is called a philtre by some people. And Numenius,\n in his Man fond of Fishing, says\u2014 \n Of all the plants which grow in fields unsown, \n Or which take root in fertile plough'd-up lands \n In winter, or when flowering spring arrives, \n Such as the thistle dry, or the wild carrot, \n Or the firm rape, or lastly, the wild cabbage. \n And Nicander, in the second book of his Georgics, says\u2014 \n Then there is also the deep root of fennel, \n And of rock-parsley, and the carrot too, \n Which loves dry soils, the sow-thistle, the myrrh plant, \n The dog-tongue and the chicory. And with them bruise \n The tough hard-tasted leaves of arum, and \n The plant which farmers do entitle bird's-milk. \n \n Theophrastus also mentions the carrot; and Ph\u00e6nias, in the\n fifth book of his treatise on Plants, speaks as follows:\u2014 But as to the\n nature of the seed, the plant which is called \u03c3\u1f74\u03c8 and the seed of the carrot are much alike. And in his\n first book he says\u2014 The following plants have seed in pods of umbellated\n form: the anise, fennel, the carrot, the bur-parsley, hemlock, coriander, and\n aconite (which some call mousekiller). But, since Nicander has\n mentioned the arum, I must also add that Ph\u00e6nias, in the book which I have just\n mentioned, writes thus:\u2014 The dracontium, which some call arum or\n aronia. But Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on the\n Wholesomes, calls the carrot, not \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, but\n \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. There is also another kind which\n is called \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, which is a large and well-grown\n carrot, more juicy than the \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, and more\n heating,\u2014more diuretic, very good for the stomach, and very easily digested, as\n Diphilus assures us. \n ","12":"\n Then there is the \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, or leek, which the\n same Diphilus says is also called \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; and he\n says that it is superior to the kind called the sliced-leek, and that it has some\n effect in attenuating the blood, and is nutritious, and apt to cause flatulence.\n But Ep\u00e6netus, in his Cookery Book, says that the leeks are also called \u03b3\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2; and I find this name occurring in Eubulus,\n in his Pornoboscus, where he says\u2014 \n I cannot now eat any other loaf, \n For I've just had one at Gnath\u00e6nius', \n Whom I found boiling up \u03b3\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n But some say that the \u03b3\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u1f76\u03c2 is the\n same as the peculiar kind of leek called \u03b3\u03ae\u03b8\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd, \n which Phrynichus mentions in his Saturn. And Didymus, interpreting that play, says\n that the \u03b3\u03ae\u03b8\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd resembles the leek called the\n vine-leek, or \u1f00\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd; and he says that they\n are also called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. And Epicharmus also\n mentions the gethyllides in his Philoctetes, where he says\u2014 \n Two heads of garlic, two gethyllides. \n And Aristophanes, in his second Aeolosicon, says\u2014 \n Some roots of leeks ( \u03b3\u03b7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd ), which taste\n almost like gallic. \n And Polemo the geographer, in his book on Samothrace, says that Latona\n had a longing for the gethyllis, writing as follows:\u2014\"Among the Delphians, at the\n festival which they call the Theoxenia, there is a rule that\n whoever brings the largest gethyllis to Latona shall receive a portion of food\n from off her table; and I myself have seen a gethyllis as big as a turnip or as\n the round rape. And men say that Latona, when she was pregnant with Apollo, longed\n for the gethyllis; on which account it is treated with this respect.\" \n ","13":"\n Next comes the gourd. But as gourds were served round to us in the winter season,\n every one marvelled, thinking that they were fresh gourds; and we recollected what\n the beautiful Aristophanes said in his Seasons, praising the glorious Athens in\n these lines:\u2014 \n \n A. There you shall at mid-winter see \n Cucumbers, gourds, and grapes, and apples, \n And wreaths of fragrant violets \n Cover'd with dust, as if in summer. \n And the same man will sell you thrushes, \n And pears, and honey-comb, and olives, \n Beestings, and tripe, and summer swallows, \n And grasshoppers, and bullock's paunches. \n There you may see full baskets packed \n With figs and myrtle, crown'd with snow; \n There you may see fine pumpkins join'd \n To the round rape and mighty turnip; \n So that a stranger well may fear \n To name the season of the year. \n \n B. That's a fine thing if all the year \n A man can have whate'er he pleases. \n \n A. Say rather, it's the worst of evils; \n For if the case were different, \n Men would not cherish foolish fancies \n Nor rush into insane expenses. \n But after some short breathing time \n I might myself bear off these things; \n As indeed in other cities, \n Athens excepted, oft I do: \n However, as I tell you now, \n The Athenians have all these things. \n Because, as we may well believe, \n They pay due honour to the gods. \n \n B. 'Tis well for them they honour you, \n Which brings them this enjoyment, since \n You seek to make their city Egypt, \n Instead of the immortal Athens. \n At all events, we were astonished eating cucumbers in the month of\n January; for they were green, and full of their own Peculiar flavour, and they\n happened to have been dressed by cooks who above all men knew\n how to dress and season such things. Laurentius, therefore, asked whether the\n ancients were acquainted with this vegetable, or with this way of dressing it. And\n Ulpian said\u2014Nicander the Colophonian, in the second book of his Georgics, mentions\n this way of dressing the vegetable, calling the gourds not \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, but \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9; for, indeed,\n that was one of their names, as we have said before. And his words are:\u2014 \n First cut the gourds in slices, and then run \n Threads through their breadth, and dry them in the air; \n Then smoke them hanging them above the fire; \n So that the slaves may in the winter season \n Take a large dish and fill it with the slices, \n And feast on them on holidays: meanwhile \n Let the cook add all sorts of vegetables, \n And throw them seed and all into the dish; \n Let them take strings of gherkins fairly wash'd, \n And mushrooms, and all sorts of herbs in bunches, \n And curly cabbages, and add them too. \n \n \n ","14":"\n The next thing to be mentioned is poultry. And since poultry was placed on the\n gourds and on other scraped ( \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f70 ) vegetables,\n (and this is what Aristophanes in his Delian Woman says of chopped up vegetables, \n \u03ba\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f70, or pressed grapes, ) Myrtilus\n said,\u2014But now, in our time, we have got into a habit of calling nothing \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03c2 or \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1 but\n pullets, of which I see a quantity now being brought round. (And Chrysippus the\n philosopher, in the fifth book of his Treatise on what is Honourable and Pleasant,\n writes thus\u2014 As some people insist upon it that white pullets are nicer than\n black ones. ) And the names given to the male fowl are \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 and \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. But anciently, men were accustomed to use the word\n \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2, both in the masculine and feminine\n gender, and to apply it to other birds, and not to this species in particular to\n the exclusion of others, as is now done when we speak of buying birds, and mean\n only poultry. Accordingly, Homer says, \n And many birds ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 ) beneath the\n sun's bright rays. \n And in another place he uses the word in the feminine gender, and says\u2014\n \n A tuneful bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b9 \u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc7 ). \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n \n As the bold bird her helpless young attends, \n From danger guards them, and from want defends; \n In search of prey she wings the spacious air, \n And with untasted food supplies her care, \n \u2014 again using \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 in the feminine gender. But Menander in his first edition of\n the Heiress, uses the word plainly in the sense in which it is used at the present\n day; saying\u2014 \n A cock had loudly crow'd\u2014 Will no one now, \n \n He cried out, drive this poultry ( \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03c2 ) from our doors \n \n And again, he writes\u2014 \n She scarcely could the poultry ( \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 )\n drive away. \n But Cratinus, in his Nemesis, has used the form \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, saying\u2014 \n And all the other birds ( \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1 ). \n And they use not only the form \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd, but\n also that of \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1, in the masculine gender. The\n same Cratinus says in the same play\u2014 \n A scarlet winged bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\n \u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And again, he says\u2014 \n You, then, must now become a large bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\n \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd ). \n And Sophocles, in his Antenorid\u00e6, says\u2014 \n A bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1 ), and a crier, and a\n servant. \n And Aeschylus, in his Cabiri, says\u2014 \n I make you not a bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1 ) of this my\n journey. \n And Xenophon, in the second book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia, says\u2014 Going in\n pursuit of birds ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03c2 ) in the severest\n winter. And Menander, in his Twin Sisters, says\u2014 \n I came laden with birds ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ). \n And immediately afterwards he has \n He sends off birds ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 ). \n And that they often used \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 as the\n plural form we have the evidence of Menander to prove to us: and also Alcman says\n somewhere or other\u2014 \n The damsels all with unaccomplish'd ends \n Departed; just as frighten'd birds ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 )\n who see \n A hostile kite which hovers o'er their heads. \n And Eupolis, in his Peoples, says\u2014 \n Is it not hard that I should have such sons, \n When every bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ) has offspring like\n its sire? \n \n \n ","15":"\n But, on the other hand, the ancients sometimes also used the\n word \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u1f7c\u03bd in the feminine gender for a hen.\n Cratinus, in his Nemesis, says\u2014 \n This is your work, O Leda. Take you care \n To imitate the manners of a hen ( \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) \n And sit upon this egg, that so you may \n Show us from out this shell a noble bird. \n And Strattis, in his Men Fond of Cold, says\u2014 \n And all the hens ( \u03b1\u1f31 \u03b4\u02bc \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\n \u1f05\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ), \n And all the pigs are also dead, \n And all the little birds around. \n And Anaxandrides says, in his Tereus\u2014 \n They saw the boars their species propagate \n With joy, and likewise all the hens ( \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n And since I have mentioned this comic poet, and as I know, too, that this\n play of his, namely Tereus, is not reckoned one of his best, I will also bring\n forward, my friends, for you judgment, what Cham\u00e6leon of Heraclea has said about\n him in the sixth book of his treatise on Comedy; where he uses the following\n language:\u2014\"Anaxandrides once, publishing a dithyrambic poem at Athens, entered the\n city on a horse, and recited some lines of his Ode. And he was a very fine,\n handsome man to look at; and he let his hair grow, and wore a purple robe with\n golden fringes, but being a man of a bitter disposition he was in the habit of\n behaving in some such manner as this with respect to his comedies. Whenever he did\n not get the victory he took his play and sent it to the frankincense market to be\n torn up to pack bunches of frankincense in, and did not revise it as most people\n did. And in this way he destroyed many clever and elegant plays; being, by reason\n of his old age, very sulky with the spectators. And he is said to have been a\n Rhodian by birth, of the city of Camirus: and I wonder therefore how it was that\n his Tereus got preserved, since it did not obtain the victory; and I feel the same\n wonder in the case of others by the same author. And Theopompus, in his Peace,\n also uses the word \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd for hens, speaking\n thus\u2014 \n I am so vex'd at having lost the hen ( \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1 ) \n Which laid the finest eggs in all the yard. \n And Aristophanes, in his D\u00e6dalus, says\u2014 \n She laid a noble egg, like any hen ( \u03b1\u00b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd ). \n \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Sometimes we find that hens ( \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 )\n when driven about, \n And frighten'd, lay wind eggs. \n And in the Clouds, where he is explaining to the old man the difference\n between the names, he says\u2014 \n \n A. Tell me then, now, what name I ought to give\n them. \n \n B. Call this, the hen, \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03cd\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, thus, \n And call her mate, the cock, \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1. \n \n And we find the cock called \u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 and\n \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1. And Simonides writes\u2014 \n O tuneful voiced \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03c0. \n \n And Cratinus, in his Seasons, says\u2014 \n Like the Persian loud-voiced cock ( \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1 ), \n Who every hour sings his song. \n And he has this name from rousing us from our beds ( \u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ). But the Dorians, who write \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 with a \u03be, \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03be, make the\n genitive with a \u03c7, \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. But Aleman writes the\n nominative with a \u03c2 , saying\u2014 \n The purple bird ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 ) of spring. \n Though I am aware that he too makes the genitive with a X, saying\u2014 \n But yet by all the birds ( \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd ). \n \n \n ","16":"\n The next thing to be mentioned is the pig, under the name of \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be . Epicharmus calls the male pig \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be in his Ulysses the Deserter, saying\u2014 \n I lost by an unhappy chance \n A pig ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 ) belonging to the\n neighbours, \n Which I was keeping for Eleusis \n And Ceres's mysterious feast. \n Much was I grieved; and now he says \n That I did give it to th' Ach\u00e6ans, \n Some kind of pledge; and swears that I \n 'Betray'd the pig ( \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 )\n designedly. \n And Anaxilus also, in his Circe, has used the word \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be in the masculine gender; and moreover has used it of a\n full-grown pig, saying\u2014 \n Some of you that dread goddess will transform \n To pigs ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 ), who range the mountains\n and the woods. \n Some she will panthers make; some savage wolves, \n And terrible lions. \n But Aristophanes, in his Fryers, applies the word to female pigs; and\n says\u2014 \n The paunch, too, of a sow in autumn born ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\n \u1f40\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n \n And in his Acharnians he says\u2014 \n For she is young ( \u03bd\u03ad\u03b1 ), but when she is a\n sow ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ), \n You'll see she'll have a large, fat, ruddy tail; \n And if you keep her she'll be a noble pig ( \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac ). \n And Eupolis, in his Golden Age, uses it as feminine; and Hipponax wrote\u2014\n \n \n \u02bd\u1f61\u03c2 \u02bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b7 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be. \n \n And, indeed, it is the female pig which is more correctly called by this\n name, as having \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2, for that world \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u1f7a\u03c2 means a womb. And it is the word from which\n \u1f00\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u1f78\u03c2 is derived. But respecting the age of\n these animals, Cratinus speaks in his Archilochi, saying\u2014 \n These men have \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, the others \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n And Aristophanes the grammarian, in his treatise on Ages,\n says\u2014 Those pigs which are now come to a compact form, are called\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2; ; but those which are tender, and\n are full of juice, are called \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9; \n and this makes that line of Homer intelligible\u2014 \n The servants all have little pigs ( \u03c7\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1 )\n to eat, \n But on fat hogs ( \u03c3\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 ) the dainty suitors\n feast. \n \n And Plato the comic poet, in his Poet, uses the word in the masculine\n gender, and says\u2014 \n He led away the pig ( \u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 ) in\n silence. \n But there was ancient custom, as Androtion tells us, for the sake of the\n produce of the herds, never to slay a sheep which had not been shorn, or which had\n never had young, oh which account they always ate full-grown animals: \n But on fat hogs the dainty suitors feast. \n And even to this day the priest of Minerva never sacrifices a lamb, and\n never tastes cheese. And when, on one occasion, there was a want of oxen,\n Philochorus says, that a law was passed that they should abstain from slaying them\n on account of their scarcity, wishing to get a greater number, an to increase the\n stock by not slaying them. But the Ionians use the word \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 also of the female pig, as Hipponax does, where he says\u2014\n \n With pure libations and the offer'd paunch \n Of a wild sow ( \u1f00\u03b3\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c7\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 ). \n And Sophocles, in his T\u00e6narus, a satyric drama, says\u2014 \n Should you then guard her, like a chain'd up sow ( \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03bd )? \n \n And Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, in the ninth book of his\n Commentaries, says\u2014 When I was at Assus, the Assians brought me a pig\n ( \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) two cubits and a half in height,\n and the whole of his body corresponding in length to that height; and of a\n colour as white as snow: and they said that King Eumenes had been very diligent\n in buying all such animals of them, and that he had given as much as four\n thousand drachm\u00e6 a piece for one. And Aeschylus says\u2014 \n But I will place this carefully fed pig \n Within the crackling oven; and, I pray, \n What nicer dish can e'er be given to man? \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n \n A. Is he a white one? \n \n B. Aye, indeed he is \n A snow white pig ( \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ), and singed most\n carefully. \n \n A. Now boil him, and take care he is not burnt. \n And again in another place he says\u2014 \n But having kill'd this pig ( \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5 ),\n of the same litter \n Which has wrought so much mischief in the house, \n Pushing and turning everything upside down. \n And these lines have all been quoted by Cham\u00e6leon, in his Commentary on\n Aeschylus. \n ","17":"\n But concerning the pig, that it is accounted a sacred animal among the Cretans,\n Agathocles the Babylonian, in the first book of his account of Cyzicus, speaks as\n follows\u2014 \"They say that Jupiter was born in Crete, on the mountain Dicte; on which\n mountain a mysterious sacrifice used to take place. For it is said that a sow\n allowed Jupiter to suck its udder. And that she going about with her constant\n grunting, made the whining of the infant inaudible to those who were looking for\n him. On which account all the Cretans think that that animal is to be worshipped;\n and nothing, it is said, can induce them to eat its flesh. And the Praisians also\n sacrifice to a sow; and this is a regular sacrifice among that people before\n marriage. And Neanthes of Cyzicus gives a similar account, in the second book of\n his treatise on Mysteries. \n Ach\u00e6us the Eretrian mentions full-grown sows under the name of \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f55\u03b5\u03c2 in Aethon, a satyric drama, where he says\u2014\n \n And I have often heard of full-grown sows \n Under this shape and form. \n \n But he has given the name of \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 by a metaphor from heifers. For they are called \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, or spreading, from their horns, when they have\n spreading horns. And Eratosthenes has spoken of pigs in the same way as Ach\u00e6us has\n in his Anterinnys, and has called them \u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1f76, \n using this word metaphorically, which properly belongs to fatted oxen which were\n called so from the verb \u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, which is a\n word of the same meaning as \u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to be fed\n up. And Sophron uses the word\u2014 \n \n \u03b2\u03cc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \n \n or perhaps it comes from Larina, a small town of Epirus, or from the name\n of the herdsman, which may have been Larinus. \n ","18":"\n And once when a pig was served up before us, the half of which was being carefully\n roasted, and the other half boiled gently, as if it had been steamed, and when all\n marvelled at the cleverness of the cook, he being very proud of his skill,\n said\u2014And, indeed, there is not one of you who can point out the place where he\n received the death wound; or where his belly was cut so as to be stuffed with all\n sorts of dainties. For it has thrushes in it, and other birds; and it has also in\n it parts of the abdomens of pigs, and slices of a sow's womb, and the yolks of\n eggs, and moreover the entrails of birds, with their ovaries, those also being\n full of delicate seasoning, and also pieces of meat shred into thin shavings and\n seasoned with pepper. For I am afraid to use the word \u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 before Ulpian, although I know that he himself is very fond\n of the thing. And, indeed, my favourite author Paxamus speaks of it by this name,\n and I myself do not care much about using no words but such as are strictly Attic.\n Do you, therefore, show me now how this pig was killed, and how I contrived to\n roast half of him and to boil the other side. And as we kept on examining him, the\n cook said,\u2014But do you think that I know less about my business than the ancient\n cooks, of whom the comic poets speak? for Posidipus, in his Dancing Women, speaks\n as follows-and it is a cook who is represented as making the following speech to\n his pupils\u2014 \n ","19":"\n \n \n My pupil Leucon, and the rest of you, \n You fellow servants\u2014for there is no place \n Unfit to lecture upon science in; \n \n Know that in the cookery no seasoning \n Is equal to the sauce of impudence. \n And, if I must confess the whole o' the truth, \n You'll find this quality of great use everywhere. \n See now, this tribune, who displays a breast-plate \n All over scales, or dragon wrought in steel, \n Appears some Briareus; but when th' occasion \n Calls for his might, he proves a very hare. \n So when a cook with helpers and attendants \n Comes to some stranger, and his pupils brings, \n Calling the servants of the house mere humbugs, \n Mere cummin splitters, famine personified; \n They all crouch down before him: but if you bear \n Yourself with honesty and spirit towards him, \n He'll fly half flay'd with fear. Do you remember, \n And, as I bade you, give fair room for boasting, \n And take you care to know the taste of the guests; \n For as in any other market, so \n This is the goal which all your art should seek,, \n To run straight into all the feasters' mouths \n As into harbour. At the present moment \n We're busied about a marriage feast\u2014 \n An ox is offer'd as the choicest victim; \n The father-in-law is an illustrious man, \n The son-in-law a person of like honour; \n Their wives are priestesses to the good goddess. \n Corybantes, flutes, a crowd of revellers \n Are all assisting at the festival. \n Here's an arena for our noble art. \n Always remember this. \n And concerning another cook (whose name is Seuthes) the same poet speaks\n in the following manner\u2014 \n Seuthes, in the opinion of those men, \n Is a great bungler. But I'd have you know, \n My excellent friend, the case of a good cook \n Is not unlike that of a general. \n The enemy are present,\u2014the commander, \n A chief of lofty genius, stands against them, \n And fears not to support the weight of war:\u2014 \n Here the whole band of revellers is the enemy, \n It marches on in close array, it comes \n Keen with a fortnight's calculation \n Of all the feast: excitement fires their breasts, \n They're ready for the fray, and watch with zeal \n To see what will be served up now before them. \n Think now, that such a crowd collected sits \n To judge of your performance. \n \n \n ","20":"\n Then you know there is a cook in the Synephebi of Euphron; just hear what a\n lecture he gives\u2014 \n \n When, Carion, you a supper do prepare, \n For those who their own contributions bring, \n You have no time to play, nor how to practise \n For the first time the lessons you've received. \n And you were yesterday in danger too; \n For not one single one of all your tenches \n Had any liver, but they all were empty. \n The brain was decomposed too.\u2014But you must, \n O Carion, when at any future time \n You chance a band like this to thus encounter, \n As Dromon, Cerdon, and Soterides, \n Giving you all the wages that you ask'd, \n Deal with them fairly. Where we now are going \n To a marriage feast, there try experiments. \n And if you well remember all my rules, \n You are my real pupil; and a cook \n By no means common: 'tis an opportunity \n A man should pray for. Make the best of it, \n The old man is a miser, and his pay \n Is little. If I do not find you eating up \n The very coals, you're done for. Now go in; \n For here the old man comes himself, behold \n How like a skin-flint usurer he looks! \n \n \n ","21":"\n But the cook in Sosipater's Liar is a great sophist, and in no respect inferior to\n the physicians in impudence. And he speaks as follows\u2014 \n \n A. My art, if you now rightly do consider it, \n Is not, O Demylus, at all an art \n To be consider'd lightly;\u2014but alas, \n 'Tis too much prostituted; and you'll find \n That nearly all men fear not to profess \n That they are cooks, though the first principles \n Of the great art are wholly strange to them; \n And so the whole art is discredited. \n But when you meet an honest, genuine cook, \n Who from his childhood long has learnt the art, \n And knows its great effects, and has its rules \n Deep buried in his mind; then, take my word, \n You'll find the business quite a different thing. \n There are but three of us now left in Greece; \n Boidion, and Chariades, and I; \n The rest are all the vilest of the vile. \n \n B. Indeed? \n \n A. I mean it. We alone preserve \n The school of Sicon: he was the great teacher \n Of all our art: he was the first who taught us \n To scan the stars with judgment: the great Sicon! \n Then, next to this he made us architects: \n He open'd too the paths of physical knowledge; \n And after this he taught us all the rules \n \n Of military science; for all these \n Were but preliminaries accessory \n To the preeminent, god-like art of cooking. \n \n B. I think you mean to choke me, my good friend. \n \n A. Not I; but till the boy comes back from\n market \n I'll stir you up a little with some rules \n About your art, since we can never have \n A more convenient time for talking of it. \n \n B. Oh, by Apollo, you're a zealous man. \n \n A. Listen, my friend. In the first place, a cook \n Must the sublimer sciences have learnt: \n He must know when the stars do set and rise, \n And why. Moreover, when the sun returns, \n Causing the long and short days on the earth; \n And in what figures of the zodiac \n He is from time to time. For, men do say \n All fish, and every meat and herb we eat, \n Have different qualities at different seasons \n Of the revolving year; and he who knows \n The principles and reasons of these things \n Will use each meat when it is most in season; \n And he who knows them not, but acts at random, \n Is always laugh'd at most deservedly. \n Perhaps, too, you don't know wherein the science \n Of th' architect can bear on this our art. \n \n B. Indeed I wondered what it had to do with it. \n \n A. I'll tell you:\u2014rightly to arrange the\n kitchen, \n To let in just the light that's requisite, \n To know the quarter whence the winds blow most, \n Are all of great importance in this business\u2014 \n For smoke, according to which way it goes, \n Makes a great difference when you dress a dinner. \n \n B. That may be; but what need is there, I pray, \n For cooks to have the science of generals? \n \n A. Order is a prevailing principle \n In every art; and most of all in ours: \n For to serve up and take away each dish \n In regular order, and to know the time \n When quick t' advance them, and when slowly bring, \n And how each guest may feel towards the supper, \n And when hot dishes should be set before him, \n When warm ones, and when regular cold meat \n Should be served up, depends on various branches \n Of strategetic knowledge, like a general's. \n \n B. Since then you've shown me what I wish'd to\n know, \n May you, departing now, enjoy yourself. \n \n \n ","22":"\n And the cook in the Milesians of Alexis is not very different from this, for he\n speaks as follows\u2014 \n \n A. Do you not know, that in most arts and trades \n 'Tis not th' artificer who alone has pow'r \n \n O'er their enjoyment Those who use them too \n Contribute all their part, if well they use them. \n \n B. How so? Let me, O stranger, understand. \n \n A. The duty of the cook is but to dress \n And rightly season meat; and nothing more. \n If, then, the man who is to eat his meat, \n And judge of it, comes in proper time, \n He aids the cook in that his business. \n But if he come too late, so that the joint \n Already roasted must be warm'd again, \n Or if he come too soon, so that the cook \n Is forced to roast the meat with undue haste, \n He spoils the pleasure which he might have had \n From the cook's skill by his unpunctuality. \n I class a cook among philosophers; \n You're standing round; my fire is alight; \n See how the numerous dogs of Vulcan's pack \n Leap to the roof; . . . . . \n . . . . . .

There was the Rhodian \n Agis, the best of cooks to roast a fish; \n Nereus, the Chian, could a conger boil \n Fit for the gods: Charides, of Athens, \n Could season forcemeat of the whitest hue: \n Black broth was first devised by Lamprias; \n Sausages rich we owe to Aphthonetus; \n Euthunus taught us to make lentil soup; \n Aristion made out whole bills of fare \n For those who like a picnic entertainment. \n So, like those grave philosophers of old, \n These are our seven wisest of all cooks. \n But I, for all the other ground I saw \n \n Had been pre-occupied by former artists, \n First found out how to steal, in such a way \n That no one blamed me, but all sought at once \n T' engage my aid.

So when he had taken such an oath as that, we all thought\n we ought not to press the man; but all began to lay hands on the different dishes\n which were served up before us.

Then when the greater part of the blood had flowed from it, all the\n entrails, with the intestines, I washed (and the word \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 , O you revellers who think so much of words, means not only a taking out, but also the entrails themselves) care-\n fully in wine several times, and hung the pig up by his feet. Then again I washed\n him in wine; and having boiled up beforehand all the seasonings which I have\n spoken of with a good deal of pepper, I pushed them in at his mouth, pouring in\n afterwards a quantity of broth very carefully made. And after this I plastered\n over one-half of the pig, as you see, with a great quantity of barleymeal, having\n soaked that in wine and oil. And then I put it in an oven, placing under it a\n brazen table, and I roasted it at a gentle fire, so as not to burn it, nor, on the\n other hand, to take it away before it was quite done. And when the skin began to\n get roasted and brown, I conjectured that the other side was boiled enough. And so\n then I took off the barleymeal, and brought it up in that condition and set it\n before you. \n ","26":"\n But as to the word \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, my excellent friend\n Ulpian, Dionysius the comic poet, in his drama called Things having the same Name,\n speaks thus, representing a cook speaking to his pupils\u2014 \n Come now, O Dromon, if you aught do know, \n Wise or accomplish'd in your business, \n Or fit to charm the eyes, reveal it straight \n To me your master. For I ask you now \n For a brief exhibition of your skill. \n I'm leading you into an enemy's country; \n Come gaily to the charge. They'll weigh the meat \n And count the joints they give you, and they'll watch you: \n But you, by boiling them to pieces, will \n Not only make them tender, but confuse \n The number of the pieces, so as quite \n To upset all their calculations. \n They bring you a fine fish;\u2014his trail is yours. \n And if you filch a slice, that, too, is yours. \n While we are in the house: when we've got out \n It then belongs to me.

Then another made answer, An illness has overtaken him, O\n Socrates, \u2014and so they went through the whole dialogue in this manner,\n so that those who were at the feast were very indignant, arid so that that\n all-accomplished man was laughed at and insulted every day, and that on this\n account many most respectable men refused all invitations to his entertainments.\n But these cooks of ours, who are perhaps just as well instructed in these things\n as he was, give us no little pleasure. And then the slave who had been praised for\n his cleverness as a cook, said,\u2014Now what have my predecessors ever devised or told\n us of a similar kind to this and is not my behaviour moderate enough, since I do\n not boast myself? And yet Corebus the Elean, who was the first man who ever was\n crowned as victor in the Olympic games, was a cook; and yet he was not as proud of\n his skill and of his art as the cook in Straton in the Ph\u0153nicides, concerning whom\n the man who had hired him speaks thus\u2014 \n ","28":"\n \n \n 'Tis a male sphinx, and not a cook, that I \n Seem to have introduced into my house. \n For by the gods I swear there's not one thing \n Of all he says that I can understand, \n So full is he of fine new-fangled words. \n For when he first came in, he, looking big, \n Ask'd me this question\u2014\"How many \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 \n now \n Have you invited here to dinner?

For Cratinus is a witness that\n they were acquainted with people whose business it was to feed geese, in his\n Dionysalexander, where he says\u2014 \n Geese-feeders, cow-herds . . . . \n \n \n And Homer uses the word \u03c7\u1f74\u03bd in both the masculine\n and feminine gender; for he says\u2014 \n \n \u03b1\u1f30\u03b5\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u1f74\u03bd \u03c7\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u2013 An eagle carrying\n off a lazy goose. \n And again he says\u2014 \n And as he seized a fine home-fatten'd goose ( \u03c7\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\n \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd ). \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n I've twenty geese, fond of the lucid stream, \n Who in my house eat wheat, and fatten fast. \n And Eupolis mentions the livers of geese (and they are thought an\n excessive delicacy at Rome), in his Women Selling Garlands, where he says\u2014 \n If you have not a goose's liver or heart. \n \n \n ","32":"\n There were also heads of pigs split in half and served up as a dish.

The man will kill me with his endless\n questions. \n \n \n ","35":"\n These passages I have quoted to you on the part of us who are still alive, my\n well-fed friend Ulpian. For you too, as it seems to me, agree so far with Alexis\n as to eat no living animals. And Alexis, in his Attic Woman, speaks in the\n following manner\u2014 \n The man who first did say that no philosopher \n Would eat of living things, was truly wise. \n \n For I am just come home, and have not bought \n A living thing of any kind. I've bought \n Some fish, but they were dead, and splendid fish. \n Then here are joints of well-fed household lamb, \n But he was killed last week. What else have I? \n Oh, here's some roasted liver. If there be \n A man who can this liver prove to have \n Or soul or voice or animation, \n I will confess I've err'd and broken the law. \n So now after all this let us have some supper. For just see, while I am\n talking to you, all the pheasants have flown by me, and are gone out of reach,\n disregarding me, because of your unseasonable chattering. But I should like you to\n tell me, my master Myrtilus, said Ulpian, where you got that word \u1f40\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1, and also whether any ancient author\n mentions the pheasant, and I\u2014 \n Rising at early morn to sail . . . . \n not through the Hellespont, but into the market-place, will buy a\n pheasant which you and I may eat together. \n ","36":"\n And Myrtilus said,\u2014On this condition I will tell you. Amphis uses the word\n \u1f40\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1 in his Gyn\u00e6comania, where he speaks\n as follows:\u2014 \n Eurybates, you hunter of rich smells, \n You surely are the most well-fed ( \u1f40\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1 ) of men. \n And as for the bird called the pheasant, that delicious writer\n Aristophanes mentions it in his play called The Birds. There are in that play two\n old Athenians, who, from their love of idleness, are looking for a city where\n there is nothing to do, that they may live there; and so they take a fancy to the\n life among the birds. And accordingly they come to the birds: and when all of a\n sudden some wild bird flies towards them, they, alarmed at the sight, comfort one\n another, and say a great many things, and among them they say this\u2014 \n \n A. What now is this bird which we here behold? \n Will you not say? \n \n B. I think it is a pheasant. \n And I also understand the passage in the Clouds to refer to birds, and\n not to horses as many people take it\u2014 \n The Phasian flocks, bred by Leogoras. \n For it is very possible that Leogoras may have bred horses and pheasants\n too. And Leogoras is also turned into ridicule as a gourmand by Plato in his Very\n Miserable Man. And Mnesimachus, in his play called Philip,\n (and Mnesi- machus is one of the poets of the Middle Comedy,) says\u2014 \n And as the proverb runs, it is more rare \n Than milk of birds, or than a splendid pheasant \n Artistically pluck'd. \n And Theophrastus the Eresian, a pupil of Aristotle, mentions them in the\n third book of his Treatise on Animals, speaking nearly as follows\u2014 There is\n also some such difference as this in birds. For the heavy birds which are not\n so well suited for flying such as the woodcock, the partridge, the cock, and\n the pheasant, are very well adapted for walking and have thick plumage. \n And Aristotle, in the eighth book of his History of Animals, writes\n thus:\u2014 Now of birds there are some which are fond of dusting themselves,\n and some which are fond of washing, and some which neither dust nor wash\n themselves. And those which are not good flyers, but which keep chiefly on the\n ground, are fond of dusting themselves; such as the common fowl, the partridge,\n the woodcock, the pheasant, the lark. Speusippus also mentions them in\n the second book of his treatise on Things Resembling one another. And the name\n these men give the pheasant is \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2, not\n \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. \n \n ","37":"\n But Agatharchides of Cnidos, in the thirty-fourth book of his History of the\n Affairs of Europe, speaking of the river Phasis, writes as follows:\u2014 But the\n great multitude of the birds called pheasants ( \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ) come for the sake of food to the places where the\n mouths of the rivers fall into the sea. And Callixenus the Rhodian, in\n the fourth book of his Account of Alexandria, describing a procession which took\n place in Alexandria, when Ptolemy who was surnamed Philadelphus was king,\n mentions, as a very extraordinary circumstance connected with these\n birds\u2014 Then there were brought on in cases parrots, and peacocks, and\n guinea-fowl, and pheasants, and an immense number of Aethiopian birds. \n And Artemidorus the pupil of Aristophanes, in his book entitled The Glossary of\n Cookery, and Pamphilus the Alexandrian, in his treatise on Names and Words,\n represents Ep\u00e6netus as saying in his Cookery Book that the pheasant is also called\n \u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2. But Ptolemy Euergetes, in the second\n book of his Commentaries, says that the pheasant is called \u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2. Now this is what I am able to tell you about the pheasant,\n which I have seen brought up on your account, as if we all\n had fevers. But you, if you do not, according to your agreement, give me tomorrow\n what you have covenanted to, I do not say that I will prosecute you in the public\n courts for deceit, but I will send you away to live near the Phasi, as Polemon,\n the Describer of the World, wished to drown Ister the pupil of Callimachus, the\n historian, in the river of the same name. \n ","38":"\n The next thing to be mentioned is the woodcock. Aristophanes, in his Storks, says\u2014\n \n The woodcock, most delicious meat to boil, \n Fit dish for conqueror's triumphal feast. \n And Alexander the Myndian says that it is a bird a little larger than a\n partridge, and spotted all over the back, about the colour of earthenware, but a\n little more ruddy. And it is caught by the hunters, because it is a heavy flyer in\n consequence of the shortness of its wings; and it is a bird fond of dusting\n itself, and very prolific, and it feeds on seeds. But\n Socrates, in his treatise on Boundaries, and Places, and Fire, and Stones,\n says,\u2014 The woodcock having been transported into Egypt from Lydia, and\n having been let loose in the woods there, for some time uttered a sound like a\n quail: but after the river got low, and a great scarcity arose, in which a\n great many of the natives of the country died, they never ceased uttering, as\n they do to this day, in a voice more distinct than that of the very clearest\n speaking children, ' Threefold evils to the wicked doers.' But when they are\n caught it is not only impossible to tame them, but they even cease to utter any\n sound at all; but if they are let go again, they recover their voice. \n And Hipponax mentions them thus\u2014 \n Not eating woodcocks or the timid hare. \n And Aristophanes, in his Birds, mentions them also. And in his Acharnians\n he speaks of them as being very common in the district about Megara. And the Attic\n writers circumflex the noun in a manner quite contrary to analogy. For words of\n more than two syllables ending in \u03b1\u03c2, when the\n final \u03b1 is long, are barytones; as for instance,\n \u1f00\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, \n \u1f00\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2. And we ought also to read the plural\n \u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9, and not \u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n \n ","39":"\n There is also a bird called the porphyrion. And it is well known that this bird is\n mentioned by Aristophanes. And Polemo, in the fifth book of his treatise addressed\n to Antigonus and Ad\u00e6us, says that the bird called the porphyrion, when it is kept\n in a house, watches those women who have husbands very closely; and has such\n instantaeous perception of any one who commits adultery, that, when it perceives\n it, it gives notice of it to the master of the house, cutting its own existence\n short by hanging itself. And, says he, it never partakes of food before it has\n walked all round the place seeking for some spot which may suit it; land then it\n dusts itself there, and washes itself, and after that it feeds. And Aristotle says\n that it has cloven feet, and that it is of a dark blue colour, with long legs,\n with a beak of a scarlet colour beginning at its very head; of about the size of a\n cock of the common poultry-breed; and it has a small Gullet, on which account it\n seizes its food with its foot, and divides it into diminutive morsels. And it\n drinks greedily and it has five toes on each foot, of which the middle one is the\n largest. But Alexander the Myndian, in the second book of his treatise on the\n History of Birds, says that the bird comes originally from Libya, and that it is\n sacred to the gods of Libya. \n There is also another bird called the porphyris. Callimachus, in his treatise on\n Birds, says that the porphyris is different from the porphyrion, and enumerates\n the two birds separately. And he says that the porphyrion takes its food while\n hiding itself in darkness, so that no one may see it; for it hates those who come\n near its food. And Aristophanes also mentions the porphyris in his drama entitled\n The Birds. And Ibycus speaks of some birds which he calls lathipor-phyrides, and\n says; There are some variegated ducks with purple necks which frequent the highest\n branches of the trees; and the birds called lathiporphyrides with variegated\n necks, and king-fishers with extended wings.\" And in another place he says\u2014 \n You're always bearing me aloft, my mind, \n Like some bold porphyris, with out-stretch'd wings. \n \n \n ","40":"\n The next bird is the partridge. A great many authors mention this bird, as also\n does Aristophanes. And some of them in the oblique cases\n shorten the penultima of the noun; as Archilochus does where he writes\u2014 \n \n \u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f65\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u1fd6\u03ba\u03b1, \n \n in the same way as \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u1fe6\u03b3\u03b1 and \u03c7\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u1fd6\u03ba\u03b1 have the penultima short. But it is usually made\n long by the Attic writers. Sophocles, in his Camici, says\u2014 \n A man arrived, who in the famous hills \n Of Attica is a namesake of the partridge ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u00b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n And Pherecrates, or whoever it was who wrote the Chiron, says\u2014 \n He goes against his will, like any partridge ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u00b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Phrynichus, in his Tragedians, says\u2014 \n And Cleombrotus the son of Perdix ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u00b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ), \n (for the bird is sometimes cited as a model of lasciviousness). \n Nicophon, in his Handicraftsmen, says\u2014 \n The hepseti, and all those partridges ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u00b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n But Epicharmus, in his Revellers, uses the word with the penultima short,\n where he says\u2014 \n They brought in cuttle-fish, who swim the deep, \n And partridges ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 ) who fly in lofty\n air. \n And Aristotle gives the following account of the bird\u2014 \"The partridge is\n a land bird, with cloven feet; and he lives fifteen years: but the female lives\n even more. For among all birds the female lives longer than the male. It lays\n eggs, and hatches its young itself, as the common hen does. And when it is aware\n that it is being hunted, it comes away from its nest, and rolls near the legs of\n the huntsman, giving him a hope that he may catch it; and so it deceives him,\n until its young have flown away, and then it flies away itself also. \n ","41":"\n \n But it is a very ill-disposed and cunning animal; and moreover it is much\n devoted to amatory enjoyments; on which account it breaks the eggs of its hen,\n that it may not be deprived of her while she is hatching them; and therefore\n the hen, knowing this, runs away and hides her eggs. And Callimachus\n gives the same account in his treatise on Birds. And the single birds fight with\n one another, and the one which is defeated becomes the mate of the conqueror. But\n Aristotle says that they all in turn use the bird which has been defeated as their\n mate, and that the tame birds also take the wild ones for\n their mates. And the bird which is defeated by the other patiently allows itself\n to be treated by him as his mate. And this happens at a particular time of the\n year, as is also stated by Alexander the Myndian. And they lay their eggs on the\n ground, both the cocks and the hens making themselves separate nests. And the\n leader of the wild birds attacks the decoy partridge, and when he is taken another\n comes forward to fight the decoy bird; and this is done whenever the bird used for\n the decoy is a cock bird; but when a hen is employed for the purpose, then she\n crows till the leader of the wild birds meets her, and the rest of the wild birds\n assemble and drive him away from the hen, because he is attending to her and not\n to them; on which account sometimes he advances without making any noise, in order\n that no other bird may hear his voice and come to fight him. And sometimes the hen\n also checks the crowing of the cock as he comes up: and very often when she is sitting on her\n nest she gets off it on perceiving the cock approaching the decoy bird, and\n remains there to receive his embraces in order to draw him away from the decoy\n bird. And so very eager to propagate their species are both quails and partridges,\n that they fall into the hands of the hunters on that account, sitting on the\n tiles. They say, too, that when hen partridges are taken out to hunt, even when\n they see or smell a cock standing or flying down the wind, become pregnant, and\n some say that they immediately begin to lay eggs. And about breeding time they fly\n about with their mouths open, putting out their tongues, both hens and cocks. And\n Clearchus says, in his treatise on Panic Fear,\u2014 Sparrows and partridges, and\n also the common barn-door fowl and the quail, are eager to propagate their\n species, not only the moment that they see the hen, but even as soon as hey\n hear her voice. And the cause of this is the excessive impression made on their\n minds by amatory pleasures and proximity. And you may see more easily all that\n takes place with respect to the propagation of their species if you put a\n looking-glass opposite to them. For they run forward, being deceived by the\n appearance, and behave as if they saw a hen, and so are caught. Only the common\n poultry cock does not do so. But the perception of the\n reflected image operates on them only so far as to make them wish to\n fight. And this is the statement of Clearchus. \n ","42":"\n Partridges are by some people called \u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9, as,\n for instance, by Alcman, who speaks as follows\u2014 \n Alcman, too, began the strain; \n And he introduced into the language \n The compound name of \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 : \n showing plainly enough that he had learnt to compound the word from the\n noise made by partridges. On which account also Cham\u00e6leon of Pontus said that the\n discovery of music was originally made by the ancients from the birds singing in\n desert places; by imitation of whom they arrived at the art of music; but it is\n not all partridges who make the noise called \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, or cackling. At all events, Theophrastus, in his\n treatise on the Different Noises made by Animals of the same Species,\n says\u2014 The partridges in Attica, near Corydallus, on the side towards the\n city, cackle; but those on the other side twitter. And Basilis, in the\n second book of his History of India, says\u2014 The diminutive men in those\n countries which fight with cranes are often carried by partridges. And\n Menecles, in the first book of his Collectanea, says\u2014 The pygmies fight both\n with partridges and with cranes. But there is a different kind of\n partridge found in Italy, of a dark colour on its wings, and smaller in size, with\n a beak inclining in the smallest possible degree to a red colour. But the\n partridges about Cirrha are not at all nice to eat as to their flesh, on account\n of the nature of their food. But the partridges in B\u0153otia either do not cross into\n Attica at all, or else, whenever they do, they are easily recognised by their\n voices, as we have previously mentioned. But the partridges which are found in\n Paphlagonia, Theophrastus says, have two hearts. But those in the island of\n Sciathos feed on cockles. And sometimes they have as many as fifteen or sixteen\n young at a time; and they can only fly short distances, as Xenophon tells us in\n the first book of his Anabasis, where he writes,\u2014 But if any one rouses the\n bustard suddenly it is easy to catch him; for they can only fly a short\n distance, like partridges, and they very soon tire; but their flesh is very\n delicious. \n \n ","43":"\n And Plutarch says that Xenophon is quite correct about the\n bustard; for that great numbers of these birds are brought to Alexandria from the\n adjacent parts o Libya; being hunted and caught in this manner. The animal is a\n very imitative one, the bustard; being especially fond of imitating whatever it\n sees a man do; and accordingly it does whatever it sees the hunters do. And they,\n standing opposite to it, anoint themselves under the eyes with some unguent,\n having prepared other different unguents calculated to close up the eyes and\n eyelids; and these other unguents they place in shallow dishes near the bustards.\n And so the bustards, seeing the men anoint themselves under the eyes, do the same\n thing also themselves, taking the unguents out of these dishes; and by this means\n they are quickly caught. And Aristotle writes the following account of\n them:\u2014 It is a migratory bird, with cloven feet, and three toes; of about\n the size of a large cock, of the colour of a quail, with a long head, a sharp\n beak, a thin neck, large eyes, a bony tongue, and it has no crop. But\n Alexander the Myndian says that it is also called \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. And he says, also, that it ruminates, and that it is very\n fond of the horse; and that if any one puts on a horse's skin he can catch as many\n as he pleases; for they come up to him then of their own accord. And presently, in\n another passage, Aristotle tells us, The bustard is something like the owl,\n but it is not a bird which flies by night; and it has large feathers about its\n ears, on which account it is called \u1f66\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, from\n \u1f66\u03c4\u03b1; and it is about the size of a pigeon,\n and a great imitator of mankind; and accordingly it is caught by dancing\n opposite to them.' And it is in shape something like a man, and it is\n an imitator of whatever man does. On which account the comic poets call those\n people who are easily taken in by any one whom they chance to meet, a bustard.\n Accordingly, in hunting them, the man who is cleverest at it, stands opposite to\n them and dances; and the birds, looking at the man dancing, move like puppets\n pulled by strings; and then some one comes behind them, and, without being\n perceived, seizes on them while they are wholly occupied with the delight they\n derive from the imitation. \n ","44":"\n They say, also, that the screech-owl does the same thing: for it is said that they\n also are caught by dancing. And Homer mentions them. And there is a kind of dance,\n which is called \u03c3\u03ba\u1f7c\u03c8, or\n the screech-owl, from them; deriving its name from the variety of motion displayed\n by this animal. And the screech-owls also delight in imitation, and it is from\n their name that we say that those men \u03c3\u03ba\u03ce\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9, \n who keep looking at the person whom they wish to turn into ridicule, and mock all\n his conduct by an exact imitation, copying the conduct of those birds. But all the\n birds whose tongues are properly formed, and who are capable of uttering\n articulate sounds, imitate the voices of men and of other birds; as the parrot and\n the jay. The screech-owl, as Alexander the Myndian says, is smaller than the\n common owl, and he has whitish spots on a leaden-coloured plumage; and he puts out\n two tufts of feathers from his eyebrows on each temple. Now Callimachus says that\n there are two kinds of screech-owls, and that one kind does screech, and the other\n does not\u2014on which account one kind is called \u03c3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2, and the other kind is called \u1f00\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2, and these last are of a grey colour. \n But Alexander the Myndian says that the name is written in Homer, \u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 without the \u03c2, and\n that that was the name which Aristotle gave them; and that they are constantly\n seen, and that they are not eatable; but that those which are only seen about the\n end of autumn for a day or two are eatable. And they differ from the \u1f00\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 in their speed, and they are something like\n the turtle-dove and the pigeon in pace. And Speusippus, in the second book of his\n treatise on Things Resembling one another, also calls them \u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 without the \u03c2 . But Epicharmus\n writes \u03c3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2, epopses and owls. And Metrodorus,\n in his treatise on Custom and Habituation, says, that the screech-owl is caught by\n dancing opposite to it. \n ","45":"\n But since, when we were talking of partridges, we mentioned that they were\n exceedingly amorous birds, we ought also to add, that the cock of the common\n poultry fowl is a very amorous bird too; at all events Aristotle says, that when\n cocks are kept in the temples as being dedicated to the Gods, the cocks who were\n there before treat any new comer as a hen until another is dedicated in a similar\n manner. And if none are dedicated, then they fight together, and the one which has\n defeated the other works his will on the one which he has defeated. It is related,\n also, that a cock, whenever he goes in at any door whatever, always stoops his\n crest, and that one cock never yields to another without a\n battle; but Theophrastus says, that the wild cocks are still more amorous than the\n tame ones. He says, also, that the cocks are most inclined to pursue the hens the\n moment they leave their perch in the morning, but the hens prefer it as the day\n advances. \n Sparrows, also, are very amorous birds; on which account Terpsicles says, that\n those who eat sparrows are rendered exceedingly prone to amorous indulgences; and\n perhaps it is from such an idea that Sappho represents Venus as being drawn by\n sparrows yoked in her chariot; for they are very amorous birds, and very prolific.\n The sparrow has about eight young ones at one hatching, according to the statement\n of Aristotle. And Alexander the Myndian says that there are two kinds of sparrows,\n the one a tame species, and the other a wild one; and he adds that the hen-sparrow\n is weaker in other respects, and also that their beaks are of a more horny colour,\n and that their faces are not very white, nor very black; but Aristotle says that\n the cock-sparrow never appears in the winter, but that the hen-sparrows remain,\n drawing his conclusions as to what he thinks probable from their colour; for their\n colour changes, as the colour of blackbirds and of coots does, who get whiter at\n certain seasons. But the people of Elis call sparrows \u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, as Nicander the Colophonian tells us in the third book of\n his treatise on Different Dialects. \n ","46":"\n We must also speak of the quail; they are called \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2. And here the rearises a general question about words ending\n in \u03c5\u03be, why the words with this termination do not\n all have the same letter as the characteristic of the genitive case. I allude to\n \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03be and \u1f44\u03bd\u03c5\u03be. \n For the masculine simple nouns ending in \u03be when\n the vowel \u03c5 precedes \u03be, and when the last syllable begins with any one of the immutable\n consonants or those which are characteristic of the first conjugation of\n barytone verbs, make the genitive with \u03ba; as\n \u03ba\u1fc6\u03c1\u03c5\u03be \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \n \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03c5\u03be \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \u1fce\u03b5\u03c1\u03c5\u03be \u1f14\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b2\u03ad\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03be, \u03b2\u03ad\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2; but\n those which have not this characteristic make the genitive with a \u03b3, as \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03be \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03be\n \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03be \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2; and there is one word with a peculiar\n inflexion, \u1f44\u03bd\u03c5\u03be \u1f44\u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; and as a general rule, in\n the nominative case plural, they follow the genitive case singular in having the\n same characteristic of the last syllable. And the case is the\n same if the last syllable does not begin with a consonant at all. \n But with respect to the quail Aristotle says, The quail is a migratory\n bird, with cloven feet, and he does not make a nest, but lies in the dust; and\n he covers over his hole with sticks for fear of hawks; and then the hen lays\n her eggs in the hole. But Alexander the Myndian says, in the second\n book of his treatise on Animals, The female quail has a thin neck, not\n having under its chin the same black feathers which the male has. And when it\n is dissected it is found not to have a large crop, but it has a large heart\n with three lobes; it has also its liver and its gall-bladder united in its\n intestines, but it has but a small spleen, and one which is not easily\n perceived; and its testicles are under its liver, like those of the common\n fowl. And concerning their origin, Phanodemus, in the second book of\n his History of Attica, says:\u2014 When Erysichthon saw the island of Delos,\n which was by the ancients called Ortygia, because of the numerous flocks of\n quails which came over the sea and settled in that island as one which afforded\n them good shelter . . . And Eudoxus the Cnidian, in the first book of\n his Description of the Circuit of the Earth, says that the Ph\u0153nicians sacrifice\n quails to Hercules, because Hercules, the son of Asteria and Jupiter, when on his\n way towards Libya, was slain by Typhon and restored to life by Iolaus, who brought\n a quail to him and put it to his nose, and the smell revived him. For when he was\n alive he was, says Eudoxus, very partial to that bird. \n ","47":"\n But Eupolis uses the word in its diminutive form, and in his play called Cities,\n calls them \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, speaking as follows:\u2014 \n \n A. Tell me now, have you ever bred any \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c3? \n \n \n B. I've bred some small \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1. What of that \n And Antiphanes, in his play called The Countryman, speaks as follows,\n using also the form \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u00b7\u2014 \n \n For what now could a man like you perform, \n Having the soul of a quail ( \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 )? \n It is an odd expression that Pratinas uses, who in his Dym\u00e6n\u00e6, or the\n Caryatides, calls the quail a bird with a sweet voice, unless indeed quails have\n voices in the Phliasian or Laced\u00e6monian country as partridges have; and perhaps it\n is from this, also, that the bird called \u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \n has its name, as Didymus says. For nearly all birds derive\n their tames from the sounds which they make. \n There is also a bird called the \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (which\n is mentioned by Crates in his Chirons, where he says, \n The \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 came from Ithaca.) \n And Alexander the Myndian also mentions it, and says that in size it is\n nearly equal to a turtle-dove; that it has long legs, a slender body, and is very\n timid. And with respect to the hunting for quails, Clearchus the Solensian\n mentions some very singular circumstances, in his book which is entitled A\n Treatise on those things which have been asserted on Mathematical Principles in\n Plato's Polity, where he writes as follows\u2014 Quails, about\n breeding time, if any one puts a looking-glass opposite to them, and a noose in\n front of it, run towards the bird which is seen in the looking-glass; and so\n fall into the noose. And about the birds called jackdaws he makes a\n similar statement, saying\u2014 And a very similar thing happens to the jackdaws,\n on account of their naturally affectionate disposition towards each other. For\n they are a most exceedingly cunning bird; nevertheless when a bowl full of oil\n is placed near them, they stand on the edge of the bowl, and look down, and\n then rush down towards the bird which appears visible in the liquid. In\n consequence of which, when they are soaked through with the oil, their wings\n stick together and cause them to be easily captured. And the Attic\n writers make the middle syllable of the oblique cases of \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03be long, like \u03b4\u03bf\u03af\u03b4\u1fe6\u03ba\u03b1, and\n \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u1fe6\u03ba\u03b1; as Demetrius Ixion tells us, in his\n treatise on the Dialect of the Alexandrians. But Aristophanes, in his Peace, has\n used the word with the penultima short for the sake of the metre, writing\u2014 \n The tame domestic quails ( \u1f44\u03c1\u03c4\u1fe6\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2\n \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 ). \n There is also a bird called \u03c7\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \n which is a small kind of quail, which is mentioned by Cleomenes, in his letter to\n Alexander, where he expresses himself in the following manner\u2014 Ten thousand\n preserved coots, and five thousand of the kind of thrush called tylas, and ten\n thousand preserved \u03c7\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1. \n And Hipparchus, in his Egyptian Iliad, says\u2014 \n I cannot fancy the Egyptian life, \n Plucking the chennia, which they salt and eat. \n \n \n ","48":"\n And even swans in great plenty were not wanting to our\n banquets. And Aristotle speaks in the following manner of this bird\u2014 The\n swan is a prolific bird, and a quarrelsome one. And, indeed, they are so fond\n of fighting that they often kill one another. And the swan will fight even the\n eagle; though he does not begin the battle himself. And they are tuneful birds,\n especially towards the time of their death. And they also cross the seas\n singing. And they are web-footed, and feed on herbage. But Alexander\n the Myndian says, that though he followed a great many swans when they were dying,\n he never heard one sing. And Hegesianax of Alexandria, who arranged the book of\n Cephalion, called the History of Troy, says that the Cycnus who fought with\n Achilles in single combat, was fed in Leucophrys by the bird of the same name,\n that is, by the swan. But Boius, or Boio, which Philochorus says was his proper\n name, in his book on the Origin of Birds, says that Cycnus was turned into a bird\n by Mars, and that when he came to the river Sybaris he was cooped with a crane.\n And he says, also, that the swan lines his nest with that particular grass which\n is called lyg\u00e6a. \n And concerning the crane ( \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ), Boius says\n that there was among the Pygmies a very well known woman whose name was Gerana.\n And she, being honoured as a god by her fellow-countrymen, thought lightly of\n those who were really gods, and especially of Juno and Diana. And accordingly\n Juno, being indignant, metamorphosed her into an unsightly bird, and made her\n hostile to and hated by the Pygmies who had been used to honour her. And he says,\n also, that of her and Nicodamas was born the land tortoise. And as a general rule,\n the man who composed all these fables asserts that all the birds were formerly\n men. \n ","49":"\n The next bird to be mentioned is the pigeon. Aristotle says, that there is but one\n genus of the pigeon, but five subordinate species; writing thus\u2014 The pigeon,\n the \u0153nas, the phaps, the dove, and the turtle-dove. But in the fifth\n book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, he makes no mention of the phaps,\n though Aeschylus, in his tragedy called Proteus, does mention that bird in the\n following line\u2014 \n Feeding the wretched miserable phaps, \n Entangled as to its poor broken sides \n Within the winnowing spokes. \n \n And in his Philoctetes he uses the word in the genitive case\n plural, \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u1ff6\u03bd. \n The \u0153onas, then, says Aristotle, is something larger than\n the pigeon, and it has a puce-coloured plumage; but the phaps is something\n between the pigeon and the \u0153nas. And the species called phassa is about as\n large as the common cock, but of the colour of ashes; and the turtledove is\n less than all the other species, and is o a cinder-colour. And this last is\n only seen in the summer, and during the winter it keeps in its hole. Now, the\n phaps and the common pigeon are always to be seen, but the \u0153nas is only visible\n in the autumn. And the species called the phassa is said to be longer lived\n than any of the others; for it lives thirty or forty years. And the cock birds\n never leave the hens to the day of their death, nor do the hens ever desert the\n cock: but when one dies the other remains solitary: and crows, and ravens, and\n jackdaws all do the same thing. And in every kind of the genus pigeon, both\n male and female sit on the eggs in turn; and when the chickens are hatched, the\n cock bird spits upon them to prevent their being fascinated. And the hen lays\n two eggs, the first of which produces a cock and the second a hen. And they lay\n at every season of the year; so that they lay ten or eleven times a year; and\n in Egypt they lay twelve times; for the hen conceives again the very next day\n to that in which it lays. And further on, in the same book, Aristotle\n says that the kind called \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 differs from\n the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2, and the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 is the least of the two. And the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 is easily tamed; but the \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 is black, and small, and has red rough legs; on which\n account no one keeps them. But he mentions a peculiarity of the species called\n \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70, that they kiss one another when\n courting, and that if the males neglect this, the hens do not admit their\n embraces. However, old doves do not go through this formality; but omit the kisses\n and still succeed in their suit, but the younger ones always kiss before they\n proceed to action. And the hens, too, make love to one another, when there is no\n cock at hand, kissing one another beforehand. But still, as there are no real\n results, the eggs which they lay never produce chickens. The Dorians, however,\n consider the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 and the \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 as identical; and Sophron uses the two words as synonymous\n in his Female Actresses. But Callimachus, in his treatise on Birds, speaks of the\n pyrallis, the dove, the wood-pigeon, and the turtle-dove, as\n all different from one another. \n ","50":"\n But Alexander the Myndian says, that the pigeon never lifts up his head when it\n drinks, as the turtle-dove does; and that it never utters any sound in the winter\n except when it is very fine weather. It is said, also, that when the species\n called \u0153nas has eaten the seed of the mistletoe, and then leaves its droppings on\n any tree, mistletoe after that grows upon that tree. But Daimachus, in his history\n of India, says that pigeons of an apple-green colour are found in India. And\n Charon of Lampsacus, in his history of Persia, speaking of Mardonius, and of the\n losses which the Persian army sustained Off Mount Athos, writes as\n follows\u2014 And that was the first time that white pigeons were ever seen by\n the Greeks; as they had never existed in that country. And Aristotle\n says, that the pigeons, when their young are born, eat a lot of earth impregnated\n with salt, and then open the mouths of their young and spit the salt into them;\n and by this means prepare them to swallow and digest their food. And at Eryx in\n Sicily, there is a certain time which the Sicilians call The Departure, at which\n time they say that the Goddess is departing into Africa: and at this time all the\n pigeons about the place disappear, as if they had accompanied the Goddess on her\n journey. And after nine days, when the festival called \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, that is to say The Return, is celebrated, after one\n pigeon has first arrived, flying across the sea like an avant-courier, and has flown into the temple, the rest follow speedily.\n And on this, all the inhabitants around, who are comfortably off, feast; and the\n rest clap their hands for joy. And at that time the whole place smells of butter,\n which they use as a sort of token of the return of the Goddess. But Autocrates, in\n his history of Achaia, says that Jupiter once changed his form into that of a\n pigeon, when he was in love with a maiden in Aegium, whose name was Phthia. But\n the Attic writers use the word also in the masculine gender, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2. Alexis, in his People Running together, says\u2014 \n For I am the white pigeon ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 ) of\n Venus; \n But as for Bacchus, he knows nothing more \n Than how to get well drunk; and nothing cares \n Whether 'tis new wine that he drinks or old. \n \n But in his play of the Rhodian, or the Woman Caressing, he\n uses the word in the feminine gender; and says in that passage that the Sicilian\n pigeons are superior to all others\u2014 \n Breeding within some pigeons from Sicily, \n The fairest shaped of all their species. \n And Pherecrates, in his Painters, says\u2014 \n Send off a pigeon ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd ) as a\n messenger. \n And in his Petale he uses the diminutive form \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, where he says,\u2014 \n But now, my pigeon, fly thou like Callisthenes, \n And bear me to Cythera and to Cyprus. \n And Nicander, in the second book of his Georgics, mentions the Sicilian\n doves and pigeons, and says,\u2014 \n And do you in your hall preserve a flock \n Of fruitful doves from Sicily or Dracontium, \n For it is said that neither kites nor hawks \n Incline to hurt those choice and sacred birds. \n \n \n ","51":"\n We must also mention ducks. The male of these birds, as Alexander the Myndian\n says, is larger than the female, and has a more richly coloured plumage: but the\n bird which is called the glaucion, from the colour of its. eyes, is a little\n smaller than the duck. And of the species called boscades the male is marked all\n over with lines, and he also is less than the duck; and the males have short\n beaks, too small to be in fair proportion to their size: but the small diver is\n the least of all aquatic birds, being of a dirty black plumage, and it has a sharp\n beak, turning upwards towards the eyes, and it goes a great deal under water.\n There is also another species of the boscades, larger than the duck, but smaller\n than the chenalopex: but the species which are called phascades are a little\n larger than the small divers, but in all other respects they resemble the ducks.\n And the kind called uria are not much smaller than the duck, but as to its plumage\n it is of a dirty earthenware colour, and it has a log and narrow beak: but the\n coot, which also has a narrow beak, is of a rounder shape, and is of an ash colour\n about the stomach, and rather blacker on the back. But Aristophanes in his\n Acharnians, in the following lines, mentions the dusk and the diver, from whose\n names ( \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 ) and \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u1f70\u03c2 ) we get the verbs \u03bd\u03ae\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, \n to swim, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03c9, to dive, with a great many\n other water birds\u2014 \n \n Ducks too, and jackdaws, woodcocks too, and coots, \n And wrens, and divers. \n And Callimachus also mentions them in his treatise on Birds. \n ","52":"\n We often also had put before us the dish called parastat\u00e6 which is mentioned by\n Ep\u00e6netus in his Cookery Book, and by Semaristus in the third and fourth books of\n his treatise on Synonymes. And it is testicles which are called by this name. But\n when some meat was served up with a very fragrant sauce, and when some one\n said,\u2014Give me a plate of that suffocated meat, that D\u00e6dalus of names, Ulpian,\n said\u2014 I myself shall be suffocated if you do not tell me where you found any\n mention of meat of that kind; for I will not name them so before I know. And he\n said, Strattis, in his Macedonians or Cinesias, has said\u2014 \n Take care, and often have some suffocated meat. \n And Eubulus, in his Catacollomenos, says\u2014 \n And platters heap'd with quantities of meat \n Suffocated in the Sicilian fashion. \n And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, has said\u2014 \n Some suffocated meat in a platter. \n And Cratinus, in his Delian Women, says\u2014 \n And therefore do you take some meat and pound it, \n Having first neatly suffocated it. \n And Antiphanes, in his Countryman, says\u2014 \n And first of all \n I bring you the much-wish'd-for barley-cake, \n Which the all-genial mother Ceres gives \n A joyfull gift to mortals; and besides, \n Some tender limbs of suffocated goats \n Set round with herbs, a young and tender meat. \n \n B. How say you? \n \n A. I am going through a tragedy \n Of the divinest Sophocles. \n \n \n ","53":"\n And when some sucking-pigs were carried round, and the guests made an inquiry\n respecting them, whether they were mentioned by any ancient author, some one\n said\u2014Phe- recrates, in his Slave turned Tutor, says\u2014 \n I stole some sucking-pigs not fully grown. \n And in his Deserters be says\u2014 \n Are you not going to kill a sucking-pig? \n \n And Alc\u00e6us, in his Pal\u00e6stra, says\u2014 \n For here he is himself, and if I grunt \n One atom more than any sucking-pig . . . \n And Herodotus, in his first book, says that in Babylon there is a golden\n altar, on which it is not lawful to sacrifice anything but sucking-pigs.\n Antiphanes says in his Philet\u00e6rus\u2014 \n There's here a pretty little cromaciscus \n Not yet wean'd, you see. \n And Heniochus, in his Polyeuctus, says\u2014 \n The ox was brazen, long since past all boiling, \n But he perhaps had taken a sucking-pig, \n And slaughter'd that. \n And Anacreon says\u2014 \n Like a young sucking kid, which when it leaves \n Its mother in the wood, trembles with fear. \n And Crates, in his Neighbours, says\u2014 \n For now we constantly have feasts of lovers, \n As long as we have store of lambs and pigs \n Not taken from their dams. \n And Simonides represents Danae as speaking thus over Perseus\u2014 \n O my dear child, what mis'ry tears my soul! \n But you lie sleeping, \n You slumber with your unwean'd heart. \n And in another place he says of Archemorus\u2014 \n Alas the wreath! They wept the unwean'd child, \n Breathing out his sweet soul in bitter pangs. \n And Clearchus, in his Lives, says that Phalaris the tyrant had arrived at\n such a pitch of cruelty, that he used to feast on sucking children. And there is a\n verb \u03b8\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, which means to suck milk, (Homer\n says\u2014 \n Hector is mortal, and has suck'd the breast;) \n because the mother's breast is put into the mouth of the infant. And that\n is the derivation of the word \u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, breast,\n from \u03c4\u03af\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9, to place, because the breasts are\n thus placed in the children's mouths. \n After she'd lull'd to sleep the new-born kids, \n As yet unweaned from their mother's breast. \n \n \n ","54":"\n And when some antelopes were brought round, Pala- medes of Elea, the collector of\n words, said\u2014It is not bad meat that of the antelopes ( \u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ). And Myrtilus said to him\u2014The word is only \u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03cd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, not \u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \n Xenophon, in the first book of his Anabasis, says, And\n there were in that part bustards and \u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n \n ","55":"\n The next thing to be mentioned is the peacock.

But the first year of a hen's\n laying she does not lay more than eight eggs; and she sometimes lays wind eggs\n like the common hen, but never more than two; and she sits upon her eggs and\n hatches them very much in the same way as the common hen does. And\n Eupolis, in his Deserters from the Army, speaks of the peacock in the following\n terms\u2014 \n Lest I should keep in Pluto's realm, \n A peacock such as this, who wakes the sleepers. \n And there is a speech extant, by Antiphanes the orator, which is\n entitled, On Peacocks. And in that speech there is not one express mention of the\n name peacock, but he repeatedly speaks of them in it as birds of variegated\n plumage, saying\u2014 That Demus, the son of Pyrilampes, breeds these birds, and\n that out of a desire to see these birds, a great many people come from\n Laced\u00e6mon and from Thessaly, and show great anxiety to get some of the\n eggs. And with respect to their appearance he writes thus\u2014 If any\n one wishes to remove these birds into a city, they will fly away and depart;\n and if he cuts their wings he takes away their beauty. For their wings are\n their beauty, and not their body. And that people used to be very\n anxious to see them he tells us subsequently in the same book, where he says;\n But at the time of the festival of the new moon, any one who likes is\n admitted to see them, but on other days if any one comes and wishes to see them\n he is never allowed to do so; and this is not a custom of\n yesterday, or a recent practice, but one which has subsisted for more than\n thirty years. \n \n ","56":"\n \n But the Athenians call the word \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03c2, \n as Tryphon tells us, circumflexing and aspirating the last\n syllable. And they read it spelt in this way in the Deserters from the Army of\n Eupolis, in the passage which has been already quoted, and in the Birds of\n Aristophanes\u2014 \n Are you then Tereus? are you a bird or a peacock ( \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03c2 )? \n And in another passage he writes\u2014 \n A bird then; what kind? is it not a peacock ( \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03c2 )? \n But in the dative they say \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03bd\u03b9, as\n Aristophanes does in the same play. But it is quite impossible in the Attic or\n Ionic dialects that, in nouns which have more than one syllable, the last\n syllable beginning with a vowel should be aspirated; for it is quite inevitable\n that it should be pronounced with a lene breathing, as \u03bd\u03b5\u1f62\u03c2, \u03bb\u03b5\u1f62\u03c2, \u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u1f60\u03c2, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u1f60\u03c2, \u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u1f60\u03c2, \n \u03b5\u1f54\u03bd\u03b5\u1f60\u03c2, \u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u1f60\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u1fb6\u1f40\u03c2, \u1f51\u03af\u1f40\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2, \u03c7\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2, \u03b4\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2, \u03c7\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2,\n \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2, \u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u1f40\u03c2, \n \u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u1f44\u03c2, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u1f42\u03c2, \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u1f42\u03c2, \u03c0\u03b7\u1f42\u03c2, \u03b3\u03cc\u1f40\u03c2, \u03b8\u03bf\u1f42\u03c2, \u1fe5\u03cc\u1f40\u03c2,\n \u03b6\u03c9\u1f44\u03c2. For the aspirate is fond of beginning a word, and is by\n nature inclined to the lead, and is never included in the last part of a word.\n And the name \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03c2 is derived from the extension\n ( \u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ) of the wings. And Seleucus,\n in the fifth book of his treatise on Hellenisms, says: The peacock,\n \u03c4\u03b1\u1f67\u03c2 :\u2014but the Attics, contrary to all rule,\n both aspirate and circumflex the last syllable; but the aspirate is only\n attached to the first vowel, when it begins a word in the simple pronunciation\n of the word, and there taking the lead, and running on more swiftly, it has the\n first place in the word. Accordingly, the Athenians, in consequence of this\n arrangement, observing the inherent character of this breathing, do not put it\n on vowels, as they do often accents and breathings,\n but put it before them. And I think that the ancients used to mark the aspirate\n by the character H, on which account the Romans write the letter H at the\n beginning of all aspirated nouns, showing its predominan nature; and if this be\n the proper character of the aspirate, it is plain that it is contrary to all\n reason and analogy that the word \u03c4\u03b1\u1ff6\u03c2 has any\n breathing at all marked upon it by the Attic writers. \n \n ","57":"\n And as at the banquet a great many more discussions arose about each of the dishes\n that were served up;\u2014But I, said Laurentius, according to the\n example of our most ex- cellent friend Ulpian, will myself also say something to\n you (for we are feeding on discussions). What do you think of the grouse? And when\n some one said,\u2014He is a species of bird; (but it is the custom of the sons of the\n grammarians to say of anything that is mentioned to them in this way, It is a\n species of plant, a species of bird, a species of stone;) Laurentius said\u2014And I,\n my good friend, am aware that the admirable Aristophanes, in his Birds, mentions\n the grouse in the following lines\u2014 \n With the porphyrion and the pelican, \n And pelecinnus, and the phlexis too, \n The grouse and peacock. \n But I wish to learn from you whether there is any mention of the bird in\n any other author. For Alexander the Myndian, in the second book of his treatise on\n Winged Animals, speaks of it as a bird of no great size, but rather as one of the\n smaller birds. For his words are these\u2014 The grouse, a bird about the size of\n rook, of an earthenware colour, variegated with dirty coloured spots, and long\n lines, feeding on fruit; and when it lays its eggs it cackles ( \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 ). from which it derives its name ( \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03be ). And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's\n Wedding, says\u2014 \n For when you've taken quails and sparrows too, \n And larks who love to robe themselves in dust, \n And grouse, and rooks, and beauteous fig-peckers. \n And in another passage he says\u2014 \n There were the herons with their long bending necks, \n A numerous flock; and grouse, and rooks besides. \n But since none of you have anything to say on the subject (as you are all\n silent), I will show you the bird itself; for when I was the Emperor's Procurator\n in Mysia, and the super- intendent of all the affairs of that province, I saw the\n bird in that country. And learning that it was called by this name among the\n Mysians and P\u00e6onians, I recollected what the bird was by the description given of\n it by Aristophanes. And believing that this bird was considered by the\n all-accomplished Aristotle worthy of being mentioned in that work of his worth\n many talents (for it is said that the Stagirite received eight hundred talents\n from Alexander as his contribution towards perfecting his History of Animals),\n when I found that there was no mention of it in this work, I was delighted at\n having the admirable Aristophanes as an unimpeachable witness\n in the matter. And while he was saying this, a slave came in bringing in the\n grouse in a basket; but it was in size larger than the largest cock of the common\n poultry, and in appearance it was very like the porphyrion; and it had wattles\n hanging from its ears on each side like the common cock; and its voice was loud\n and harsh. And so after we had admired the beauty of the bird, in a short time one\n was served up on the table dressed; and the meat of him was like that of the\n ostrich, which we were often in the habit of eating. \n ","58":"\n There was a dish too called loins ( \u03c8\u03cd\u03b1\u03b9 ). The poet\n who wrote the poem called The Return of the Atrid\u00e6, in the third book says\u2014 \n And with his rapid feet Hermioneus \n Caught Nisus, and his loins with spear transfix'd. \n And Simaristus, in the third book of his Synonymes, writes thus:\n The flesh of the loins which stands out on each side is called \u03c8\u03cd\u03b1\u03b9, and the hollows on each side they call \u03ba\u03cd\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 and \u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9. \n And Clearchus, in the second book of his treatise on The Joints in the\n Human Body, speaks thus: There is flesh full of muscle on each side; which\n some people call \u03c8\u03cd\u03b1\u03b9, and others call \u1f00\u03bb\u03ce\u03c0\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, and others \u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9. \n And the admirable Hippocrates also speaks of \u03c8\u03cd\u03b1\u03b9; and they get this name from being easily wiped ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ), or as being flesh lightly\n touching ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 ) the bones, and lying lightly\n on the surface of them.

Teleclides, in his Rigid Men, says\u2014 \n Since I'm a female, I must have an udder. \n Herodotus, in the fourth book of his History, uses the same term when\n speaking of horses; but it is rare to find the word ( \u03bf\u1f56\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1 ) applied to the other animals; but the word most commonly used\n is \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, as in the case of fishes.\n Strattis, in his Atalanta, says\u2014 \n The \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and the extremities \n Of the large tunny. \n And Theopompus, in his Call\u00e6chrus, says\u2014 \n \n A.

And do not you be vex'd \n At seeing blood fresh trickling from the meat, \n But eat it eagerly. All other ways \n Are quite superfluous, such as when cooks pour \n A lot of sticky clammy sauce upon it, \n Parings of cheese, and lees, and dregs of oil, \n As if they were preparing cat's meat. \n And Naucrates the comic poet, in his Persia, says that it is an uncommon\n thing to find a hare in Attica: and he speaks thus\u2014 \n For who in rocky Attica e'er saw \n A lion or any other similar beast, \n Where 'tis not easy e'en to find a hare \n But Alc\u00e6us, in his Callisto, speaks of hares as being plentiful, and\n says\u2014 \n You should have coriander seed so fine \n That, when we've got some hares, we may be able \n To sprinkle them with that small seed and salt. \n \n \n ","61":"\n And Tryphon says,\u2014\u201cAristophanes, in his Danaides, uses the form \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd in the accusative case with an acute accent on the\n last syllable, and with a v for the final letter, saying\u2014\n \n And when he starts perhaps he may be able \n To help us catch a hare ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd ). \n And in his Daitaleis he says\u2014 \n I am undone, I shall be surely seen \n Plucking the fur from off the hare ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd ). \n But Xenophon, in his treatise on Hunting, writes the accusative \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff6 without the v, and with a\n circumflex accent. But among us the ordinary form of the nominative case is\n \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2; and as we say \u03bd\u03b1\u1f78\u03c2, and the Attics \u03bd\u03b5\u1f7c\u03c2, and as we\n say \u03bb\u03b1\u1f78\u03c2, and the Attics \u03bb\u03b5\u03ce\u03c2; so, while we call this animal \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2, they call him \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03c2. And as\n for our using the form \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f78\u03bd in the accusative\n case singular, to that we find a corresponding nominative\n plural in Sophocles, in his Amycus, a satiric drama; where he enumerates\u2014 \n Cranes, crows, and owls, and kites, and hares ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 ). \n But there is also a form of the nominative plural corresponding to the\n accusative \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd, ending in w , as found in the Flatterers of Eupolis\u2014 \n Where there are rays, and hares ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c ), and\n light-footed women. \n But some people, contrary to all reason, circumflex the last syllable of\n this form \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ce; but it ought to have an acute\n accent, since all the nouns which end in \u03bf\u03c2, even\n when they. are changed into \u03c9\u03c2 by the Attic\n writers, still preserve the same accent as if they had undergone no alteration; as\n \u03bd\u03b1\u1f78\u03c2, \n \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c2; \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2. And so, too, Epicharmus used\n this noun, and Herodotus, and the author of the poem called the Helots. Moreover,\n \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 is the Ionic form\u2014 \n Rouse the sea-hare ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f78\u03c2 ) before you drink\n the water; \n and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03c2 the Attic one. But the Attic\n writers use also the form \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2; as Sophocles, in\n the line above quoted\u2014 \n Cranes, crows, and owls, and hares ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 ). \n There is also a line in Homer, where he says\u2014 \n \n \u1f22 \u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03cc\u03bd. \n \n Now, if we have regard to the Ionic dialect, we say that w is interpolated; and if we measure it by the Attic\n dialect, then we say the o is so: and the meat of the hare is called \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff6\u03b1 \n \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1. \n \n ","62":"\n But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, says that in the reign of\n Antigonus Gonatas, there were such a number of hares in the island of Astypal\u00e6a,\n that the natives consulted the oracle on the subject. And the Pythia answered them\n that they ought to breed dogs, and hunt them; and so in one year there were caught\n more than six thousand. And all this immense number arose from a man of the island\n of Anaphe having put one pair of hares in the island. As also, on a previous\n occasion, when a certain Astypal\u00e6an had let loose a pair of partridges in the\n island of Anaphe, there came to be such a number of partridges in Anaphe, that the\n inhabitants ran a risk of being driven out of the island by them. But originally\n Astypalea had no hares at all, but only partridges. And the hare is a very\n prolific animal as Xeno- phon has told us, in his treatise on Hunting; and\n Herodotus speaks of it in the following terms\u2014 Since\n the hare is hunted by everything-man, beast, and bird\u2014it is on this account a\n very prolific animal; and it is the only animal known which is capable of\n superfetation. And it has in its womb at one time one litter with the fur on,\n and another bare, and another just formed, and a fourth only just\n conceived. And Polybius, in the twelfth book of his History, says that.\n there is another animal like the hare which is called the rabbit ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ); and he writes as follows\u2014 The animal\n called the rabbit, when seen at a distance, looks like a small hare; but when\n any one takes it in his hands, there is a great difference between them, both\n in appearance and taste: and it lives chiefly underground. And\n Posidonius the philosopher also mentions them in his History; and we our selves\n have seen a great many in our voyage from Dic\u00e6archia to Naples. For there is an island\n not far from the mainland, opposite the lower side of Dic\u00e6archia, inhabited by\n only a very scanty population, but having a great number of rabbits. And there is\n also a kind of hare called the Chelidonian hare, which is mentioned by Diphilus,\n or Calliades, in his play called Ignorance, in the following terms\u2014 \n What is this? whence this hare who bears the name \n Of Chelidonian? Is it grey hare soup, \n Mimarcys call'd, so thick with blood? \n And Theophrastus, in the twentieth book of his History, says that there\n are hares about Bisaltia which have two livers. \n ","63":"\n And when a wild boar was put upon the table, which was in no respect less than\n that noble Calydonian boar which has been so much celebrated,\u2014I suggest to you\n now, said he, O my most philosophical and precise Ulpian, to inquire who ever said\n that the Calydonian boar was a female, and that her meat was white. But he,\n without giving the matter any long consideration, but rather turning the question\n off, said\u2014But it does seem to me, my friends, that if you are not yet satisfied,\n after having had such plenty of all these things, that you surpass every one who\n has ever been celebrated for his powers of eating,\u2014and who those people are you\n can find out by inquiry. But it is more correct and more consistent with etymology\n to make the name \u03c3\u1f7a\u03c2, with a \u03c2; for the animal has its name from rushing ( \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 ) and going on impetuously; but men have\n got a trick of pronouncing the word without the \u03c2,\u1f57\u03c2; and some people believe that it is called \u03c3\u1fe6\u03bd, by being softened from \u03b8\u1fe6\u03bd, as if it had its name from being a fit animal to sacrifice\n ( \u03b8\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ).

And I am aware, too, that there was a general of the\n Aetolians named Syagrus who is mentioned by Phylarchus, in the fourth book of his\n History. And Democritus said\u2014You always, O Ulpian, have got a habit of never\n taking anything that is set before you until you know whether the existing name of\n it was in use among the ancients.

For he became very thin by reason of his devotion to these\n inquiries, and so died, as the inscription in front of his tomb shows\u2014 \n Stranger, Philetas is my name, I lie \n Slain by fallacious arguments, and cares \n Protracted from the evening through the night. \n \n \n ","64":"\n And so that you may not waste away by investigating this word \u03c3\u03cd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, learn that Antiphanes gives this name to the\n wild boar, in his Ravished Woman:\u2014 \n This very night a wild boar ( \u03c3\u03cd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) will I\n seize, \n And drag into this house, and a lion and a wolf \n And Dionysius the tyrant, in his Adonis, says\u2014 \n Under the arched cavern of the nymphs \n I consecrate . . . . \n A wild boar ( \u03c3\u03cd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) as the first-fruits to\n the gods. \n And Lynceus the Samian, in his epistle to Apollodoru, writes\n thus\u2014 That you may have some goat's flesh for your chil- dren, and some\n meat of the wild boar ( \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c5\u03ac\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ) for your-\n self and your friends.

But,\n since you have turned off the question which was put to you about the colour of\n the Calydonian boar, and whether any one states him to have been white as to his\n flesh, we ourselves will tell you who has said so; and you yourself may\n investigate the proofs which I bring. For some time ago, I read the dithyrambics\n of Cleomenes of Rhegium; and this account is given in that ode of them which is\n entitled Meleager. And I am not ignorant that the inhabitants of Sicily call the\n wild boar (which we call \u03c3\u03cd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ) \u1f00\u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. And Aeschylus, in his Phorcides, comparing\n Perseus to a wild boar, says\u2014 \n He rush'd into the cave like a wild boar ( \u1f00\u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\n \u1f65\u03c2 ). \n And Sciras (and he is a poet of what is called the Italian comedy, and a\n native of Tarentum), in his Meleager, says\u2014 \n Where shepherds never choose to feed their flocks, \n Nor does the wild boar range and chase his mate. \n And it is not wonderful that Aeschylus, who lived for some time in\n Sicily, should use many Sicilian words. \n ","65":"\n There were also very often kids brought round by the servants, dressed in various\n ways; some of them with a great deal of assafoetida, which afforded us no ordinary\n pleasure; for the flesh of the goat is exceedingly nutritious. At all events,\n Chitomachus the Carthaginian, who is inferior to no one of the new Academy for his\n spirit of philosophical investigation, says that a certain Theban athlete\n surpassed all the men of his time in strength, because he ate goat's flesh; for\n the juice of that meat is nervous and sticky, and such as can remain a long time\n in the substance of the body. And this wrestler used to be much laughed at,\n because of the unpleasant smell of his perspiration. And all the meat of pigs and\n lambs, while it remains undigested in the system, is very apt to turn, because of\n the fat. But the banquets spoken of by the comic poets rather please the ears by\n sweet sounds, than the palate by sweet tastes; as, for instance, the feast\n mentioned by Antiphanes, in his Female Physician\u2014 \n \n A. But what meat do you eat with most delight? \n \n B. What meat?\u2014why if you mean as to its\n cheapness, \n There's mutton ere it bears you wool or milk, \n That is to say, there's lamb, my friend; and so \n \n There's also meat of goats which give no milk, \n That is to say, of kids. For so much profit \n Is got from these when they are fully grown, \n That I put up with eating cheaper kinds. \n And in his Cyclops he says\u2014 \n These are the animals which the earth produces, \n Which you will have from me: the ox of th' herd, \n The goat which roves the woods, the chamois which \n Loves the high mountain tops, the fearless ram, \n The hog, the boar, the sucking-pig besides, \n And hares, and kids . . . . \n Green cheese, dry cheese, and cut and pounded cheese, \n Scraped cheese, and chopp'd cheese, and congeal'd cheese \n \n \n ","66":"\n And Mnesimachus, in his Horse-breeder, provides the following things for dinner\u2014\n \n Come forth, O Manes, from the chamber \n Deck'd with the lofty cypress roof; \n Go to the market, to the statues \n Of Maia's son, where all the chiefs \n Of the tribes meet, and seek the troop \n Of their most graceful pupils, whom \n Phidon is teaching how to mount \n Their horses, and dismount from them. \n I need not tell you now their names. \n Go; tell them that the fish is cold, \n The wine is hot, the pastry dry, \n The bread dry, too, and hard. The chops \n Are burnt to pieces, and the meat \n Taken from out the brine and dish'd. \n The sausages are served up too; \n So is the tripe, and rich black puddings. \n Those who 're in-doors are all at table, \n The wine cups all are quickly drain'd, \n The pledge goes round; and nought remains \n But the lascivious drunken cordax. \n \n The young men all are waxing wanton, \n And ev'rything's turn'd upside down. \n Remember what I say, and bear \n My words in mind. \n Why stand you gaping like a fool? \n Look here, and just repeat the message \n Which I've just told you; do,\u2014I will \n Repeat it o'er again all through. \n Bid them come now, and not delay, \n Nor vex the cook who's ready for them. \n For all the fish is long since boil'd, \n And all the roast meat's long since cold. \n \n And mention o'er each separate dish;\u2014 \n Onions and olives, garlic too, \n Cucumbers, cabbages, and broth, \n Fig-leaves, and herbs, and tunny cutlets, \n Glanis and rhin\u00e8, shark and conger, \n A phyxicinus whole, a tunny, \n A coracinus whole, a thunnis, \n A small anchovy, and a tench, \n A spindle-fish, a tail of dog-fish, \n A carcharias and a torpedo; \n A sea-frog, lizard, and a perch, \n A trichias and a phycis too, \n A brinchus, mullet, and sea-cuckoo. \n A turtle, and besides a lamprey, \n A phagrus, lebias, and grey mullet, \n A sparus, and \u00e6olias, \n A swallow, and the bird of Thrace, \n A sprat, a squid, a turbot, and \n Drac\u00e6nides, and polypi, \n A cuttle-fish, an orphus too; \n A crab, likewise an escharus, \n A needle-fish, a fine anchovy, \n Some cestres, scorpions, eels, and loaves. \n And loads of other meat, beyond \n My calculation or my mention. \n Dishes of goose, and pork, and beef, \n And lamb, and mutton, goat and kid; \n Of poultry, ducks and partridges, \n Andjays, and foxes. And what follows \n Will be a downright sight to see, \n So many good things there will be. \n And all the slaves through all the house \n Are busy baking, roasting, dressing, \n And plucking, cutting, beating, boiling, \n And laughing, playing, leaping, feasting, \n And drinking, joking, scolding, pricking. \n And lovely sounds from tuneful flutes, \n And song and din go through the house, \n Of instruments both wind and string'd. \n Meantime a lovely scent of cassia, \n From Syria's fertile land, does strike \n Upon my sense, and frankincense, \n And myrrh, and nard * * * \n * * * * * \n Such a confusion fills the house \n With every sort of luxury. \n \n \n ","67":"\n Now, after all this conversation, there was brought in the dish which is called\n Rhoduntia; concerning which that wise cook quoted numbers of tragedies before he\n would tell us what he was bringing us. And he laughed at those who professed to be such admirable cooks, mentioning whom, he\n said\u2014Did that cook in the play of Anthippus, the comic poet, ever invent such a\n dish as this?\u2014the cook, I mean, who, in the Veiled Man, boasted in this fashion:\u2014\n \n \n A. Sophon, an Ararnanian citizen, \n And good Democritus of Rhodes, were long \n Fellow-disciples in this noble art, \n And Labdacus of Sicily was their tutor. \n These men effaced all vulgar old recipes \n Out of their cookery books, and took away \n The mortar from the middle of the kitchen. \n They brought into disuse all vinegar, \n Cummin, and cheese, and assaf\u0153tida, \n And coriander seed, and all the sauces \n Which Saturn used to keep within his cruets. \n And the cook who employ'd such means they thought \n A humbug, a mere mountebank in his art. \n They used oil only, and clean plates, O father, \n And a quick fire, wanting little bellows: \n With this they made each dinner elegant. \n They were the first who banish'd tears and sneezing, \n And spitting from the board; and purified \n The manners of the guests. At last the Rhodian, \n Drinking some pickle by mistake, did die; \n For such a draught was foreign to his nature. \n \n B. 'Twas likely so to be. \n \n A. But Sophon still \n Has all Ionia for his dominions, \n And he, O father, was my only tutor. \n And I now study philosophic rules, \n Wishing to leave behind me followers, \n And new discover'd rules to guide the art. \n \n B. Ah! but, I fear, you'll want to cut me up, \n And not the animal we think to sacrifice. \n \n A. To-morrow you shall see me with my books, \n Seeking fresh precepts for my noble art; \n Nor do I differ from th' Aspendian. \n And if you will, you too shall taste a specimen \n Of this my skill. I do not always give \n The self-same dishes to all kinds of guests; \n But I regard their lives and habits all. \n One dish I set before my friends in love, \n Another's suited to philosophers, \n Another to tax-gatherers. A youth \n Who has a mistress, quickly will devour \n His patrimonial inheritance; \n So before him I place fat cuttle-fish \n Of every sort; and dishes too of fish \n Such as do haunt the rocks, all season'd highly \n \n With every kind of clear transparent sauce. \n For such a man cares nought about his dinner, \n But all his thoughts are on his mistress fix'd. \n Then to philosophers I serve up ham, \n Or pettitoes; for all that crafty tribe \n Are wonderful performers at the table. \n Owls, eels, and spars I give the publicans, \n When they're in season, but at other times \n Some lentil salad. And all funeral feasts \n I make more splendid than the living ones. \n For old men's palates are not critical; \n At least not half so much as those of youths. \n And so I give them mustard, and I make them \n Sauces of pungent nature, which may rouse \n Their dormant sense, and make it snug the air; \n And when I once behold a face, I know \n The dishes that its owner likes to eat. \n \n \n ","68":"\n And the cook in the Thesmophorus of Dionysius, my revellers, (for it is worth\n while to mention him also,) says\u2014 \n You have said these things with great severity, \n (And that's your usual kindness, by the Gods); \n You've said a cook should always beforehand \n Know who the guests may be for whom he now \n Is dressing dinner. For he should regard \n This single point\u2014whom he has got to please \n While seasoning his sauces properly; \n And by this means he'll know the proper way \n And time to lay his table and to dress \n His meats and soups. But he who this neglects \n Is not a cook, though he may be a seasoner. \n But these are different arts, a wondrous space \n Separates the two. It is not every one \n That's called a general who commands an army, \n But he who can with prompt and versatile skill \n Avail himself of opportunities, \n And look about him, changing quick his plans, \n He is the general. He who can't do this \n Is only in command. And so with us. \n To roast some beef, to carve a joint with neatness, \n To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire, \n Is anybody's task; he who does this \n Is but a seasoner and broth-maker: \n A cook is quite another thing. His mind \n Must comprehend all facts and circumstances: \n Where is the place, and when the time of supper; \n Who are the guests, and who the entertainer; \n What fish he ought to buy, and when to buy it. \n . . . . . For all these things \n You'll have on almost every occasion; \n But they're not always of the same importance, \n \n Nor do they always the same pleasure give. \n Archestratus has written on this art, \n And is by many people highly thought of, \n As having given us a useful treatise; \n But still there's much of which he's ignorant, \n And all his rules are really good for nothing, \n So do not mind or yield to all the rules \n Which he has laid down most authoritatively, \n For a more empty lot of maxims you \n Will hardly find. For when you write a book \n On cookery, it will not do to say, \n \n As I was just now saying; for this art \n Has no fix'd guide but opportunity, \n And must itself its only mistress be. \n But if your skill be ne'er so great, and yet \n You let the opportunity escape, \n Your art is lost, and might as well be none. \n \n B O man, you're wise. But as for this man who \n You just now said was coming here to try \n His hand at delicate banquets, say, does he \n Forget to come? \n \n A. If I but make you now \n One forced meat ball, I can in that small thing \n Give you a specimen of all my skill. \n And I will serve you up a meal which shall \n Be redolent of the Athenian breezes. \n * * * * * \n Dost fear that I shall fail to lull your soul \n With dishes of sufficient luxury? \n \n \n ","69":"\n And to all this Aemilianus makes answer\u2014 \n My friend, you've made a speech quite long enough \n In praising your fav'rite art of cookery;\u2014 \n as Hegesippus says in his Brethren. Do you then\u2014 \n Give us now something new to see beyond \n Your predecessor's art, or plague us not; \n But show me what you've got, and tell its name. \n And he rejoins\u2014 \n You look down on me, since I am a cook. \n But perhaps\u2014 \n What I have made by practising my art\u2014 \n according to the comic poet Demetrius, who, in his play entitled The\n Areopagite, has spoken as follows\u2014 \n What I have made by practising my art \n Is more than any actor e'er has gain'd,\u2014 \n This smoky art of mine is quite a kingdom. \n I was a caper-pickler with Seleucus, \n And at the court of the Sicilian king, \n \n Agathocles, I was the very first \n To introduce the royal dish of lentils. \n My chief exploit I have not mention'd yet: \n There was a famine, and a man named Lachares \n Was giving an entertainment to his friends; \n Whom I recovered with some caper-sauce. \n Lachares made Minerva naked, who caused him no inconvenience; but I will\n now strip you who are inconveniencing me, said Aemilianus, unless you show me what\n you have got with you. And he said at last, rather unwillingly, I call this dish\n the Dish of Roses. And it is prepared in such a way, that you may not only have\n the ornament of a garland on your head, but also in yourself, and so feast your\n whole body with a luxurious banquet. Having pounded a quantity of the most\n fragrant roses in a mortar, I put in the brains of birds and pigs boiled and\n thoroughly cleansed of all the sinews, and also the yolks of eggs, and with them\n oil, and pickle-juice, and pepper, and wine. And having pounded all these things\n carefully together, I put them into a new dish, applying a gentle and steady fire\n to them. And while saying this, he uncovered the dish, and diffused such a sweet\n perfume over the whole party, that one of the guests present said with great\n truth\u2014 \n The winds perfumed the balmy gale convey \n Through heav'n, through earth, and all the a\u00ebrial way; \n so excessive was the fragrance which was diffused from the roses. \n ","70":"\n After this, some roasted birds were brought round, and some lentils and peas,\n saucepans and all, and other things of the same kind, concerning which Ph\u00e6nias the\n Eresian writes thus, in his treatise on Plants\u2014 For every leguminous\n cultivated plant bearing seed, is sown either for the sake of being boiled,\n such as the bean and the pea, (for a sort of boiled soup is made of these\n vegetables,) or else for the sake of extracting from them a farinaceous flour,\n as, for instance, the aracus; or else to be cooked like lentils, as the aphace\n and the common lentil; and some again are sown in order to serve as food for\n fourfooted animals, as, for instance, the vetch for cattle, and the aphace for\n sheep. But the vegetable called the pea is mentioned by Eupolis, in his Golden\n Age. And Heliodorus, who wrote a description of the whole world, in the first\n book of his treatise on the Acropolis, said\u2014 After the manner in which to boil wheat was discovered, the ancients called it\n \u03c0\u03cd\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, but the people of the present day name\n it \u1f41\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \" \n Now, after this discussion had continued a long time, Democritus said\u2014But at least\n allow us to have a share of these lentils, or of the saucepan itself, lest some of\n you get pelted with stones, like Hegemon the Thasian. And Ulpian said,\u2014What is the\n meaning of this pelting ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2 ) with stones?\n for I know that in my native city, Eleusis, there is a festival celebrated which\n is called \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2, concerning which I will not\n say a word, unless I get a reward from each of you. But I, said Democritus, as I\n am not a person who makes speeches by the hour for hire, like the Prodeipnus of\n Timon, will tell you all I know about Hegemon. \n ","71":"\n Cham\u00e6leon of Pontus, in the sixth book of his treatise concerning ancient Comedy,\n says\u2014\"Hegemon of Thasos, the man who wrote the Parodies, was nicknamed The Lentil,\n and in one of his parodies he wrote\u2014 \n While I revolved these counsels in my mind, \n Pallas Minerva, with her golden sceptre, \n Stood by my head, and touched me, and thus spake\u2014 \n O thou ill-treated Lentil, wretched man, \n Go to the contest: and I then took courage. \n And once he came into the theatre, exhibiting a comedy, having his robe\n full of stones; and he, throwing the stones into the orchestra, caused the\n spectators to wonder what he meant. And presently afterwards he said\u2014 \n These now are stones, and let who chooses throw them; \n But Lentil's good alike at every season. \n But the man has an exceedingly high reputation for his parodies, and was\n exceedingly celebrated for reciting his verses with great skill and dramatic\n power; and on this account he was greatly admired by the Athenians. And in his\n Battle of the Giants, he so greatly delighted the Athenians, that they laughed to\n excess on that day; and though on that very day the news of all the disasters\n which had befallen them in Sicily had just arrived, still no on left the theatre,\n although nearly every one had lost relations by that calamity; and so they hid\n their faces and wept, but no one rose to depart, in order to avoid being seen by\n the spectators from other cities to be grieved at the disaster. But they remained\n listening to the performance, and that too, though Hegemon\n himself, when he heard of it, had resolved to cease his recitation. But when the\n Athenians, being masters of the sea, brought all the actions at law concerning the\n islands or the islanders into the city, some one instituted a prosecution against\n Hegemon, and summoned him to Athens to answer it. And he came in court, and\n brought with him all the workmen of the theatre, and with them he appeared,\n entreating Alcibiades to assist him. And Alcibiades bade him be of good cheer, and\n ordered all the workmen to follow him; and so he came to the temple of Cybele,\n where the trials of prosecutions were held; and then wetting his finger with his\n mouth, he wiped out the indictment against Hegemon. And though the clerk of the\n court and the magistrate were indignant at this, they kept quiet for fear of\n Alcibiades, for which reason also the man who had instituted the prosecution ran\n away.\" \n ","72":"\n This, O Ulpian, is what we mean by pelting ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2 ), but you, when you please, may tell us about the \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u1f7a\u03c2 at Eleusis. And Ulpian replied,\u2014But you have\n reminded me, my good friend Democritus, by your mention of saucepans, that I have\n often wished to know what that is which is called the saucepan of Telemachus, and\n who Telemachus was. And Democritus said,\u2014Timocles the comic poet, and he was also\n a writer of tragedy, in his drama called Lethe, says\u2014 \n And after this Telemachus did meet him, \n And with great cordiality embraced him, \n And said, \"Nowlend me, I do beg, the saucepans \n In which you boil'd your beans.\" And scarcely had \n He finish'd saying this, when he beheld \n At some small distance the renowned Philip, \n Son of Ch\u00e6rephilus, that mighty man, \n Whom he accosted with a friendly greeting, \n And then he bade him send some wicker baskets. \n But that this Telemachus was a citizen of the borough of Acharn\u00e6, the\n same poet shows us in his Bacchus, where he says\u2014 \n \n A. Telemachus th' Acharnian still is speaking, \n And he is like the new-bought Syrian slaves. \n \n B. How so, what does he do? I wish to know. \n \n A. He bears about with him a deadly dish. \n And in his Icarians, a satyric drama, he says\u2014 \n So that we'd nothing with us; I myself, \n Passing a miserable night, did first \n \n Sleep on the hardest bed; and then that Lion, \n Thudippus, did congeal us all with fear; \n Then hunger pinch'd us . . . . . . \n And so we went unto the fiery Dion. \n But even he had nought with which to help us; \n So running to the excellent Telemachus, \n The great Acharnian, I found a heap \n Of beans, and seized on some and ate them up. \n And when that ass Cephisodorus saw us, \n He by a most unseemly noise betray'd us. \n From this it is plain that Telemachus, being a person who was constantly\n eating dishes of beans, was always celebrating the festival Pyanepsia. \n ","73":"\n And bean soup is mentioned by Heniochus the comic writer, in his play called the\n Wren, where he says\u2014 \n \n A. I often, by the Gods I swear, consider \n In my own mind how far a fig surpasses \n A cardamum. But you assert that you \n Have held some conversation with this Pauson, \n And you request of me a difficult matter. \n \n B. But having many cares of divers aspects, \n Just tell me this, and it may prove amusing; \n Why does bean soup so greatly fill the stomach, \n And why do those who know this Pauson's habits \n Dislike the fire?

Sophocles, in his (Enomaus, says\u2014 \n Shaved in the Scythian manner, while his hair \n Served for a towel, and to wipe his hands in. \n And Herodotus, in the second book of his History, speaks in a similar\n manner.

And Polemo, in the sixth book of his books addressed to\n Antigonus and Ad\u00e6us, speaks of the difference between the two expressions \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b4 \u03bd\u03af\u03c8\u03b1- \n \u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9.

And Hercules also,\n without intending it, killed Cyathus, the son of Pyles and brother of Antimachus,\n who was acting as his cupbearer, as Nicander relates in the second book of his\n History of \u0152ta; to whom also he says that a temple was dedicated by Hercules in\n the Proschium, which to this day is called the Temple of the Cupbearer. \n But we will stop this conversation at this point, and begin the next book with an\n account of the voracity of Hercules. \n "},"9":{"0":"\n \n \n But a wise poet should behave \n Like one who gives a splendid feast; \n And so if he is wise should he \n Seek the spectators to delight, \n So that each one, when he departs, \n May think that he has drunk and eaten \n Exactly what he'd most have wish'd; \n Not that there should have been but one \n Dish for all sorts of appetites, \n Or but one kind of writing for all tastes. \n \n \n These, my good friend Timocrates, are the words of Astydamas the tragedian, in his\n satyric drama of Hercules. Come, let us now proceed to mention what is consistent\n with what we have said before, to show how great an eater Hercules was. And this\n is a point in his character mentioned by nearly all poets and historians.\n Epicharmus, in his Busiris, says\u2014 \n For if you were to see him eat, you would \n Be frighten'd e'en to death; his jaws do creak, \n His throat with long deep-sounding thunder rolls, \n His large teeth rattle, and his dog-teeth crash, \n His nostrils hiss, his ears with hunger tremble. \n And Ion, in his Omphale, having mentioned his voracity, adds\u2014 \n And then, excited by th' applause, he rose \n And swallow'd all the logs and burning coals. \n \n But Ion borrowed all this from Pindar, who said\u2014 * * * * *\n And they say that he was a man of such excessive voracity, that they gave him the\n cormorant, amongst birds which should be sacred to him, which is called the\n ox-eater, on account of its voracity. \n ","1":"\n And Hercules is represented as having entered into a contest with Lepreus in\n respect of their mutual powers of eating, Lepreus having been the challenger:\n however, Hercules gained the victory. But Zenodotus, in the second book of his\n Epitomes, says that Lepreus was the son of Caucon, who was the son of Neptune and\n Astydamia; and that he ordered Hercules to be thrown into prison, when he demanded\n of Augeas the reward which was due to him for his labours. But Hercules, when he\n had completed his labours, came to the house of Caucon, and at the entreaty of\n Astydamia, he became reconciled to Lepreus. And after this Lepreus contended with\n Hercules in throwing the quoit, and in drawing water, and also as to which would\n eat a bull with the greatest rapidity; and in all these things he was defeated.\n And after that he armed himself, and challenged Hercules to single combat, and was\n slain in the battle. But Matris, in his panegyric on Hercules, says, that Hercules\n was also challenged by Lepreus to a contest as to who could drink most, and that\n Lepreus was again defeated. And the Chian orator, Caucalus, the brother of\n Theopompus the historian, relates the same story in his panegyric on Hercules. \n ","2":"\n Homer, too, represents Ulysses as a great eater, and a very voracious man, when he\n says\u2014 \n What histories of toil I could declare, \n But still long-wearied nature wants repair. \n \n Spent with fatigue and shrunk with pining fast, \n My craving bowels still require repast; \n Howe'er the noble suffering mind may grieve \n Its load of anguish, and disdain to live, \n Necessity demands our daily bread; \n Hunger is insolent and will be fed. \n For in these lines his gluttony appears prodigious, when it induces him\n on so unseasonable an occasion to utter apophthegms about his stomach. For he\n ought, if he had been ever so hungry, to have endured it, or at all events to have\n been moderate in his food. But this last passage shows the\n extreme voracity and gluttony of the man\u2014 \n For all my mind is overwhelm'd with care, \n But hunger is the worst of griefs to bear; \n Still does my stomach bid me eat and drink, \n Lest on my sorrows I too deeply think. \n Food makes me all my sufferings forget, \n And fear not those which may surround me yet. \n For even the notorious Sardanapalus would hardly have ventured to give\n utterance to such sentiments as those. Moreover, when Ulysses was an old man\u2014\n \n Voraciously he endless dishes ate, \n And quaff'd unceasing cups of wine. . . \n \n \n ","3":"\n But Theagenes of Thasos, the athlete, ate a bull single-handed, as Posidippus\n tells us in his Epigrams. \n And as I'd undertaken, I did eat \n A Thracian bull. My own poor native land \n Of Thasos could not have purvey'd a meal \n Sufficient for the hunger of Theagenes. \n I ate all I could get, then ask'd for more. \n And, therefore, here you see, I stand in brass, \n Holding my right hand forth; put something in it. \n And Milo of Crotona, as Theodorus of Hierapolis tells us in his book upon\n Games, ate twenty min\u00e6 weight of meat, and an equal quantity of\n bread, and drank three choes of\n wine. And once at Olympia he took a four year old bull on his shoulders, and\n carried it all round the course, and after that he killed it and cut it up, and\n ate it all up by himself in one day. And Titormus the Aetolian had a contest with\n him as to which could eat an ox with the greatest speed, as Alexander the Aetolian\n relates. But Phylarchus, in the third book of his Histories, says that Milo, while\n lying down before the altar of Jupiter, ate a bull, on which account Dorieus the\n poet made the following epigram on him:\u2014 \n Milo could lift enormous weights from earth, \n A heifer four years old, at Jove's high feast, \n And on his shoulders the huge beast he bore, \n As it had been a young and little lamb, \n All round the wondering crowd of standers by. \n But he did still a greater feat than this, \n \n Before the altar of Olympian Jove; \n For there he bore aloft an untamed bull \n In the procession, then he cut it up, \n And by himself ate every bit of it. \n But Astydamas the Milesian, having gained the victory at Olympia three\n times in the pancratium, being once invited to supper by Ariobarzanes the Persian,\n when he had come, offered to eat everything that had been prepared for the whole\n party, and did eat it. And when, Theodorus relates, the Persian entreated him to\n do something suitable to his enormous strength, he broke off a large brazen\n ornament in the shape of a lentil from the couch and crushed it in his hand. And\n when he died, and when his body was burnt, one urn would not contain his bones,\n and scarcely two could do so. And they say that the dinner which he ate by himself\n at Ariobarzanes's table had been prepared for nine persons. \n ","4":"\n And there is nothing unnatural in such men as those being very voracious; for all\n the men who practise athletic exercises, learn with these gymnastic exercises also\n to eat a great deal. On which account Euripides says, in the first edition of his\n Autolycus\u2014 \n For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece, \n There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes. \n For, first of all, they learn not to live well, \n Nor could they do so; for could any man \n Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite \n Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches \n How could a man like that increase his substance? \n Nor yet can they put up with poverty, \n Or e'er accommodate themselves to fortune; \n And so being unaccustom'd to good habits, \n They quickly fall into severe distress.\u2014 \n In youth they walk about in fine attire, \n And think themselves a credit to the city; \n But when old age in all its bitterness \n O'ertakes their steps, they roam about the streets, \n Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off. \n And much I blame the present fashions, too, \n Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast \n Is made to pay great honour to such men, \n And to show false respect to vain amusements. \n For though a man may wrestle well, or run, \n Or throw a quoit, or strike a heavy blow, \n Still where's the good his country can expect \n From all his victories and crowns and prizes? \n Will they fight with their country's enemies \n \n With quoit in hand? Or will their speed assist \n To make the hostile bands retreat before them? \n When men stand face to face with th' hostile sword \n They think no more of all these fooleries. \n 'Twere better to adorn good men and wise \n With these victorious wreaths; they are the due \n Of those who govern states with wisdom sound, \n And practise justice, faith, and temperance; \n Who by their prudent language ward off evils, \n Banishing wars and factions. These are the men, \n Who're not alone a grace and ornament \n To their own land, but to the whole of Greece. \n \n \n ","5":"\n Now Euripides took all this from the Elegies of Xenophanes the Colophonian, who\n has spoken in this way\u2014 \n But if a man, in speed of foot victorious, \n Or in the contests of the pentathlum, \n Where is the sacred grove of Jupiter, \n Near to the sacred streamlets of Olympia; \n Or as a wrestler, or exchanging blows \n And painful struggles as a hardy boxer, \n Or in the terrible pancratium, \n He surely is a noble citizen, \n And well he does deserve the honours due \n Of a front seat at games and festivals, \n And at the public cost to be maintain'd; \n And to receive a public gift of honour, \n Which shall become an heirloom to his children. \n And such shall be his honours, even if \n He wins by horses, not by his own strength. \n And still I think he does not equal me; \n For wisdom far exceeds in real value \n The bodily strength of man, or horses' speed; \n But the mob judges of such things at random; \n Though 'tis not right to prefer strength to sense: \n For though a man may a good boxer be, \n Or pentathlete, or never-conquer'd wrestler, \n Or if he vanquish all in speed of foot\u2014 \n Which is the most important of all contests\u2014 \n Still for all this his city will enjoy \n No better laws through his great strength or speed; \n And 'tis small cause for any lasting joy, \n That one of all her citizens should gain \n A prize on Pisa's banks: for such achievements \n Fill not the country's granaries with corn. \n \n \n And Xenophanes contends at great length, and with great earnestness and variety of\n argument, in favour of the superior advantage of his own wisdom, running down\n athletic exercises as useless and unprofitable. And Ach\u00e6us the Eretrian, speaking\n of the good constitution of the athletes, says\u2014 \n \n For naked they did wave their glistening arms, \n And move along exulting in their youth, \n Their valiant shoulders swelling in their prime \n Of health and strength; while they anoint with oil \n Their chests and feet and limbs abundantly, \n As being used to luxury at home. \n \n \n ","6":"\n But Heraclitus, in his Entertainer of Stangers, says that there was a woman named\n Helena, who ate more than any other woman ever did. And Posidippus, in his\n Epigrams, says that Phuromachus was a great eater, on whom he wrote this epigram:\u2014\n \n This lowly ditch now holds Phuromachus, \n Who used to swallow everything he saw, \n Like a fierce carrion crow who roams all night. \n Now here he lies wrapp'd in a ragged cloak. \n But, O Athenian, whoe'er you are, \n Anoint this tomb and crown it with a wreath, \n If ever in old times he feasted with you. \n At last he came sans teeth, with eyes worn out, \n And livid swollen eyelids; clothed in skins, \n With but one single cruse, and that scarce full; \n For from the gay Len\u00e6an games he came, \n Descending humbly to Calliope. \n But Amarantus of Alexandria, in his treatise on the Stage, says that\n Herodorus, the Megarian trumpeter, was a man three cubits and a half in height;\n and that he had great strength in his chest, and that he could eat six\n choenixes of bread, and twenty litr\u00e6 of meat, of\n whatever sort was pro- vided for him, and that he could drink two choes of wine;\n and that he could play on two trumpets at once; and that it was his habit to sleep\n on only a lion's skin, and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast noise.\n Accordingly, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, was besieging Argos, and when\n his troops could not bring the helepolis against the walls on account of its\n weight, he, giving the signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume\n of so and which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the\n engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in all the games\n ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor tells us in his Theatrical\n Reminisce aces. And there was a woman, too, who played on the trumpet, whose name was Aglais, the daughter of Megacles, who, in the first\n great procession which took place in Alexandria, played a processional piece of\n music; having a head-dress of false hair on, and a crest upon her head, as\n Posidippus proves by his epigrams on her. And she, too, could eat twelve litr\u00e6 of\n meat and four ch\u0153nixes of bread, and drink a choeus of wine, at one sitting. \n ","7":"\n There was, besides, a man of the name of Lityerses, a bastard son of Midas, the\n king of Cel\u00e6n\u00e6 in Phrygia, a man of a savage and fierce aspect, and an enormous\n glutton; and he is mentioned by Sositheus the tragic poet, in his play called\n Daphnis or Lityersa; where he says\u2014 \n He'll eat three asses' panniers, freight and all, \n Three times in one brief day; and what he calls \n A measure of wine is a ten-amphor\u00e6 cask; \n And this he drinks all at a single draught. \n And the man mentioned by Pherecrates, or Strattis, whichever was the\n author of the play called The Good Men, was much such another the author says\u2014\n \n \n A. I scarcely in one day, unless I'm forced, \n Can eat two bushels and a half of food. \n \n B. A most unhappy man! how have you lost \n Your appetite, so as now to be content \n With the scant rations of one ship of war? \n \n \n And Xanthus, in his Account of Lydia, says that Cambles, who was the king of the\n Lydians, was a great eater and drinker, and also an exceeding epicure; and\n accordingly, that he one night cut up his own wife into joints and ate her; and\n then, in the morning, finding the hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth, he\n slew himself, as his act began to get notorious. And we have already mentioned\n Thys, the king of the Paphlagonians, saying that he too was a man of vast\n appetite, quoting Theopompus, who speaks of him in the thirty-fifth book of his\n History; and Archilochus, in his Te- trameters, has accused Charilas of the same\n fault, as the comic poets have attacked Cleonymus and Pisander. And Ph\u0153ni- cides\n mentions Ch\u00e6rippus in his Phylarchus in the following terms\u2014 \n And next to them I place Ch\u00e6rippus third; \n He, as you know, will without ceasing eat \n As long as any one will give him food, \n Or till he bursts,\u2014such stowage vast has he, \n Like any house. \n \n \n \n ","8":"\n And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the hundred and third book of his History, says\n that Mithridates, the king of Pontus, once proposed a contest in great eating and\n great drinking (and the prize was a talent of silver), and that he himself gained\n the victory in both; but he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be\n second to him, namely, Calomodrys, the athlete of Cyzicus. And Timocreon te\n Rhodian a poet, and an athlete who had gained the vcitory in the pentathlum, ate\n and drank a great deal, as the epigram on his tomb shows\u2014 \n Much did I eat, much did I drink, and much \n Did I abuse all men; now here I lie;\u2014 \n My name Timocreon, my country Rhodes. \n And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, in one his Prefaces, says that Timocreon\n came to the great king of Persia, and being entertained by him, did eat an immense\n quantity of food; and when the king asked him, What he would do on the strength of\n it? he said that he would beat a great many Persians; and the next day, having\n vanquished a great many, one after another, taking them one by one, after this, he\n beat the air with his hands; and when they asked him what he wanted, he said that\n he had all those blows left in him if any one was inclined to come on. And\n Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says, that Cantibaris the Persian,\n whenever his jaws were weary with eating, had his slaves to pour food into his\n mouth, which he kept open as if they were pouring it into an empty vessel. But\n Hellanicus, in the first book of his Deucalionea, says that Erysichthon, the son\n of Myrmidon, being a man perfectly insatiable in respect of food, was called\n Aethon. And Polemo, in the first book of his Treatise addressed to Tim\u00e6us, says\n that among the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony, and an image\n of Ceres Sito; near which, also, there was a\n statue of Himalis, as\n there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus, and as at Scolum, in B\u0153otia, there a e statues of Megalartus and Megalomazus. \n \n ","9":"\n And Alcman the poet records himself to have been a great eater, in his third book\n of Odes, when he says\u2014 \n And presently I will bestow \n On you a large round dish well fill'd; \n And even now 'tis on the fire, \n Full of pulse-broth, which e'en the glutton \n Alcman would like to feast on warm, \n After the wintry solstice sets in; \n For he for dainties does not care, \n But loves the common people's dishes, \n As long as they are full enough. \n And in his fifth book he also displays his love of eating, speaking thus\u2014\n \n God has bestow'd on man three various seasons, \n The summer, and the winter, and the autumn; \n And a fourth too, the spring, when men can dance, \n But scarce are able to get much to eat. \n \n \n And Anaxilas the comic poet, speaking in his play called Chrysochous of a man\n named Ctesias, says\u2014 \n You now have nearly all things, save the art \n Of Ctesias himself; for wise men say, \n That he does recognise nought but the beginning \n Of a rich banquet, and denies the end. \n And in his Rich Men he says\u2014 \n \n A. Others may also burst when fed too well \n Not Ctesias alone.- \n \n B. What should hinder it? \n \n A. For he, as wise men say, loves the beginning \n Of any feast, but ne'er can make an end of it. \n And in his play called The Graces he includes a man called Cranaus in his\n list of great eaters; saying\u2014 \n Men do not come and ask at random now, \n Does Cranaus eat less than Ctesias? \n Or do they both keep constantly devouring? \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Atalante, says\u2014 \n If it were needful, I could run more stadia \n Than e'er were run by Sotades; I surpass \n E'en Taureas himself in these my labours; \n And out-run Ctesias himself in eating. \n And Anaxippus, in his Thunderbolt, says\u2014 \n \n A. For now I see Damippus here approaching \n From the palaestra. \n \n B. What! that man of stone? \n \n Him whom your friends e'en now, from his great strength, \n Surname the Thunderbolt? \n \n A. Most probably; \n For I think he will overturn all tables \n Which he once strikes with his consuming jaw. \n And in these lines the comic poet shows that it was from this man that he\n had given his play the title of The Thunderbolt. And Theophilus, in his Epidaurus,\n says\u2014 \n There was a Mantinean centurion, \n Atrestides his name; who of all men \n That ever lived could eat the greatest quantity. \n And, in his Pancratiast, he introduces the athlete as eating a great\n deal, where he says\u2014 \n \n A. Of boil'd meat about three mine weight. \n \n B. Now mention something else. \n \n A. A fine pig's face; \n A ham; four pettitoes;\u2014 \n \n B. Oh, Hercules! \n \n A. Three calves' feet, and one hen. \n \n B. Oh, Ph\u0153bus, oh! \n What else? \n \n A. Two min\u00e6 weight of figs: that's all. \n \n B. And how much did you drink? \n \n A. Twelve measures only \n Of unmix'd wine. \n \n B. Oh, Bacchus! oh, Sabazius! \n \n \n ","10":"\n And whole nations also have been ridiculed by the comic poets for their gluttony;\n as the B\u0153otians, for instance. Accordingly, Eubulus says, in his Antiopa\u2014 \n We are courageous men to toil and eat, \n And to endure sharp pain; the Attic race \n Is quick and eloquent, and they eat little; \n But the B\u0153otians eat enormously. \n And in his Europa he says\u2014 \n Go now and build up the B\u0153otian city,' \n Where the men eat all day and never tire. \n And in his Ionian he says\u2014 \n He is so thorough a B\u0153otian \n In all his manners, that, like them, 'tis said \n He's never tired nor content with eating. \n And in his Cercopes he says\u2014 \n And after that I came to Thebes, where men \n Spend the whole night in feasts and revelry; \n And each man has a privy at his doors, \n Which is a great boon to an o'er-fed man; \n \n For men who have got a long way to go, \n And who eat much and bite their weary lips, \n Are some of the most ludicrous of sights. \n And in his Mysians he represents some one as making the following speech\n to Hercules\u2014 \n You leaving, as you say, the Theban plain, \n Where valiant men sit eating all the day, \n Being all throat, and close beside the privy. \n Diphilus in his B\u0153otian, says\u2014 \n That man can eat, beginning before dawn, \n Or come again and eat till the following day. \n Mnesimachus, in his Busiris, says\u2014 \n . . . . . . . For I am a B\u0153otian, \n Who do not eat much else, except these things. \n Alexis, in his Trophonius, says\u2014 \n And now that you may not be found out thus, \n And spoken of as men of B\u0153otia, \n By those whose wont it is to run you down, \n As men unequali'd in creating noise, \n And knowing nothing else save how to eat \n And drink unceasingly the whole night long; \n Strip yourselves quick, and all prepare for action. \n And Ach\u00e6us, in his Contests, says\u2014 \n \n A. Are you now speaking to the spectators here, \n Or to the body of competitors? \n \n B. To those who eat much, as men training do. \n \n A. Whence do the strangers come from? \n \n B. They're B\u0153otians. \n \n \n And very likely it is because of all this that Eratosthenes, in his Epistles,\n says, that Pempelus, when he was asked, What sort of people the B\u0153otians\n appeared to him? answered, That they only spoke just as vessels\n might be expected to speak, if they had a voice, of how much each of them could\n hold. And Polybius of Megalopolis, in the twentieth book of his\n Histories, says that the B\u0153otians, having gained great glory at the battle of\n Leuctra, after that relaxed their courage again, and turned to feasting and\n drunkenness, and to making parties for eating among friends; and many of them,\n even of those who had children, spent the greater part of their substance on their\n feasts so that there were a great number of B\u0153otians who had more invitations to\n supper than there were days in the month. On which account the Megarians, hating\n such a system as that, abandoned their alliance, and\n joined themselves to the Ach\u00e6ans. \n ","11":"\n The people of Pharsalus also are ridiculed by the comic poets as being enormous\n eaters; accordingly Mnesimachus, in his Philip, says\u2014 \n \n A. Has any man of the Pharsalians come, \n That he may eat up e'en our very tables? \n \n B. There's no one come at all. \n \n A. So much the better; \n Perhaps they have all gone somewhere else to eat \n Some city of Acha\u012ba ready roasted. \n And that it was a general imputation on all the Thessalians, that they\n were great eaters, Crates tells us in his Lamia, saying\u2014 \n Great words three cubits long, \n Cut into huge Thessalian slices thus:\u2014 \n and he by this alludes to the Thessalians as cutting their meat into\n overgrown pieces. And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Lampbearers, says also\u2014 \n And a huge piece of pork, enough to break \n One's arm, cut in the coarse Thessalian fashion. \n They used to speak also of a Thessalian mouthful, as something enormous.\n Hermippus says in his Fates\u2014 \n But Jupiter, considering nought of this, \n Wink'd, and made up a huge Thessalian mouthful. \n And such great bits of meat Aristophanes, in his Men Frying, calls\n Capanic, saying\u2014 \n What is all this \n To the great Lydian and Thessalian banquets? \n And presently he says\u2014 \n More splendid ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 ) far than the\n Thessalian; \n meaning big enough to load a wagon. For the Thessalians use the word\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 as equivalent to \u1f00\u03c0\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7. Xenarchus, in his Scythians, says\u2014 \n \n A. They kept to seven Capan\u00e6 for the games \n At Pisa. \n \n B. What do you mean? \n \n A. In Thessaly \n They call their carts Capan\u00e6. \n \n B. I understand. \n \n \n ","12":"\n And Hecat\u00e6us says that the Egyptians were great bread-eaters, eating loaves of\n rye, called \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2, and \n bruising barley to extract a drink from it; and on this account Alexis, in his\n treatise on Contentment, says that Bocchoris and his father Neochabis were\n contented with a moderate quantity of food; as Lycon of Iasus relates in his\n treatise on Pythagoras. But he did not abstain from animal food, as Aristoxenus\n tells us; and Apollodorus the Arithmetician says, that he even sacrificed a\n hecatomb when he found out that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the side\n subtending the right angle is equal to the squares of the two sides containing it\u2014\n \n When the illustrious Pythagoras \n Discover'd that renowned problem which \n He celebrated with a hecatomb. \n But Pythagoras was a very sparing drinker, and lived in a most frugal\n manner, so that he often contented himself with honey by itself. And nearly the\n same thing is told us of Aristides, and of Epaminondas, and of Phocion, and of\n Phormio, the generals. But Manius Curius, the Roman general, lived on turnips all\n his life; and once, when the Sabines sent him a large sum of gold, he said he had\n no need of gold while he ate such food as that. And this story is recorded by\n Megacles in his treatise on Illustrious Men. \n ","13":"\n And there are many people who approve of moderate meals, as Alexis tells us in his\n Woman in Love\u2014 \n But I am content with what is necessary, \n And hate superfluous things; for in excess \n There is not pleasure, but extravagance. \n And in his Liar he says\u2014 \n I hate excess; for those who practise it \n Have only more expense, but not more pleasure. \n And in his Foster Brothers he says\u2014 \n How sweet all kinds of moderation are! \n I now am going away, not empty, but \n In a most comfortable state,\u2014for wise \n Mnesitheus tells us that 'tis always right' \n T' avoid extravagance in everything. \n \n \n And Ariston the philosopher, in the second book of his Amatory Similitudes, says\n that Polemo, the Academic philosopher, used to exhort those who were going to a\n supper, to consider how they might make their party pleasant, not only for the\n present evening, but also for the morrow. And Timotheus, the son of Conon, being\n once taken by Plato from a very sumptuous and princely\n entertainment to one held at the Academy, and being there feasted in a simple and\n scholar- like manner, said that those who supped with Plato would be well the next\n day also. But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that on the next day\n Timotheus, meting with Plato, said, You, O Plato, sup well, more with\n reference to the next day than to the present one! But Pyrrho the\n Elean, when on one occasion one of his acquaintances received him with a very\n sumptuous entertainment, as he himself relates, said, I will for the future\n not come to you if you receive me in this manner; that I may avoid being\n grieved by seeing you go to a great expense for which there is no necessity,\n and that you, too, may not come to distress by being overwhelmed by such\n expenses; for it is much better for us to delight one another by our mutual\n companionship and conversation, than by the great variety of dishes which we\n set before one another, of which our servants consume the greater part. \n \n ","14":"\n But Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Menedemus, relating the way in which the\n banquets of that philosopher are managed, says, that he used to dine with one or\n two companions at most; and that all the rest of his guests used to come after\n they had supped. For in fact, Menedemus's supper and dinner were only one meal,\n and after that was over they called in all who chose to come; and if any of them,\n as would be the case, came before the time, they would walk up and down before the\n doors, and inquire of the servants who came out what was being now served up, and\n how far on the dinner had proceeded. And if they heard that it was only the\n vegetables or the cured fish that was being served up, they went away; but if they\n were told that the meat was put on the table, then they went into the room which\n had been prepared for that purpose. And in the summer a rush mat was spread over\n each couch, and in the winter a fleece. But every one was expected to bring his\n own pillow; and the cup, which was brought round to each person, did not hold more\n than one cotyla. And the dessert was lupins or beans as a general rule; but\n sometimes some fruits, such as ere in season, were brought in; in summer, pears or\n pomegranates; and in spring, pulse; and in winter, figs. And we have a witness as\n to these things, Lycophron the Chalcidian, who wrote a\n satyric drama entitled Menedemus, in which Silenus says to the satyrs\u2014 \n O cursed sons of a most excellent father, \n I, as you see, have quite a fancy for you: \n For, by the gods I swear, that not in Caria, \n Nor in fair Rhodes, nor royal Lydia, \n Have I e'er eaten so superb a supper; \n Ph\u0153bus Apollo! what a feast it was. \n And a little further on, he says\u2014 \n And the boy brought us round a scanty cup \n Of wine that might be worth five pence a bottle- \n Awfully flat; and then that cursed thing, \n That hang-dog lupin, danced upon the board, \n A fitting meal for parasites and beggars. \n And presently afterwards, he says that philosophical disqui- sitions were\n carried on during the entertainment\u2014 \n And for dessert, \n We had some learned conversation. \n It is also related that those who met in this way very often kept on\n conversing to such a time that the bird which calls the morn still caught\n them talking, and they were not yet satisfied. \n \n ","15":"\n But Arcesilaus, when giving a supper to some people, when the bread fell short,\n and his slave made him a sign that there were no loaves left, burst out laughing,\n and clapped his hands; and said, What a feast we have here, my friends! We\n forgot to buy loaves enough; run now, my boy: \u2014and this he said,\n laughing; and all the guests who were present burst out laughing, and great\n amusement and entertainment were excited, so that the very want of bread was a\n great seasoning to the feast. And at another time, Arcesilaus ordered Apelles, one\n of his friends, to strain some wine; and when he, not being used to doing so,\n shook some of the wine and spilt some, so that the wine appeared much thicker than\n usual, he laughed, and said, But I told a man to strain the wine who has\n never seen anything good any more than I myself have; so do you now get up,\n Aridices; and do you go away and tap the casks that are outside. And\n this good-humour of his so pleased and excited the mirth of those present, that\n they were all filled with joy. \n ","16":"\n But those of the present day who give entertainments, especially the inhabitants\n of the beautiful Alexandria, cry out, and make a noise, and\n curse the cup-bearer, the steward, and cook; and the slaves are all crying, being\n beaten with fists and driven about in every direction. And not only do the guests\n who are invited sup with great discomfort and annoyance, but even if there is any\n sacrifice going on, the god himself would veil his face and go away, leaving not\n only the house, but even the entire city, in which such things take place. For it\n is absurd for a man, proclaiming that people should all confine themselves to\n words of good omen, to curse his wife and his children; and such a man as that\n would say to the guests\u2014 \n And now then let us hasten to the feast, \n That we may plan the movements of the war;\u2014 \n for such a man's house\u2014 \n Is redolent of frankincense, \n And p\u00e6ans too, and groans at the same time. \n Now, when all this had been said, one of the guests who were present\n said,\u2014We ought, then, when we consider these things, to guard against indulging\n our appetites too much; \n For a frugal supper breeds no drunkenness, \n as Amphis says, in his Pan: nor does it produce insolence or insulting\n conduct; as Alexis testifies in his Ulysses Weaving, where he says\u2014 \n For many a banquet which endures too long, \n And many and daily feasts, are wont t' engender \n Insult and mockery; and those kind of jests \n Give far more pain than they do raise amusement. \n For such are the first ground of evil-speaking; \n And if you once begin t' attack your neighbour, \n You quickly do receive back all you bring, \n And then abuse and quarrels surely follow; \n Then blows and drunken riot. For this is \n The natural course of things, and needs no prophet. \n \n \n ","17":"\n And Mnesimachus, in his Philip, on account of the immoderate indulgence in suppers\n of people of his time, introduces an entertainment which professes to be a\n preparation for war, and which really is what that admirable writer Xenophon calls\n a workshop of war. And he speaks thus\u2014 \n Know you now with what men you must fight? \n With us, who sup upon well-sharpen'd swords, \n And swallow lighted firebrands for dainties: \n And then, for our dessert, our slaves bring in, \n After the first course, Cretan bows and arrows; \n \n And, 'stead of vetches, broken heads of spears, \n And fragments of well-batter'd shields and breastplates; \n And at our feet lie slings, and stones, and bows, \n And on our heads are wreaths of catapults. \n And Ph\u0153nix the Colophonian says\u2014 \n A cask of wine shall be our sword-a cup \n Shall be our spear-our hair shall arrows be; \n Goblets shall be our enemies-wine our horses- \n Ointments and perfumes our war-cry fierce. \n And in the Parasite, Alexis, speaking of some very voracious person,\n says\u2014 \n And all the younger men do call him parasite, \n Using a gentler name; but he cares not. \n And Telephus in speechless silence sits, \n Making but signs to those who ask him questions; \n So that the inviter often offers prayers \n To the great Samothracian gods o' the sea, \n To cease their blowing, and to grant a calm; \n For that young man's a storm to all his friends. \n And Diphilus, in his Hercules, speaking of some similar kind of person,\n says\u2014 \n Do you not now behold me drunk and merry, \n Well fill'd with wine, and all inflamed with anger? \n Have not I just devour'd a dozen cakes, \n Every one larger than a good-sized shield? \n On which account, Bion of the Borysthenes said, cleverly enough, that\n A man ought not to derive his pleasures from the table, but from\n meditation; and Euripides says\u2014 \n I pleased my palate with a frugal meal; \n signifying that the pleasure derived from eating and drinking is chiefly\n limited to the mouth. And Aeschylus, in his Phineus, says\u2014 \n And many a most deceitful meal they snatch'd \n Away from hungry jaws, in haste t' enjoy \n The first delight of the too eager palate. \n And in his Stheneb\u0153a, Euripides speaks of frugality thus\u2014 \n A life at sea is a much troubled life, \n Not reinforced with pleasures of the table, \n But like a stable on the shore. The sea itself \n Is a moist mother, not a nurse on land; \n 'Tis her we plough; from this our food, procured \n With nets and traps, comes daily home to us. \n \n \n ","18":"\n For the belly is a great evil to man; concerning which Alexis speaks, in his Men\n Dying together\u2014 \n \n And hence you well may see how great an evil \n The belly is to man; what lessons strange \n It teaches, and what deeds it forces on us. \n If there were any power which could take \n This part alone from out our bodies, then \n No one would any more do injury \n Or insult to his neighbour. But from this \n Flow all the ills that harass human life. \n And Diphilus, in his Parasite, says\u2014 \n Well did that wise Euripides oft speak, \n And this does seem his wisest word of all\u2014 \n \n But want compels me and my wretched belly; \n \n For there is nought more wretched than the belly: \n And into that you pour whate'er you have, \n Which you do not in any other vessel. \n Loaves you perhaps may in a wallet carry,\u2014 \n Not soup, or else you'll spoil it. So again, \n You put cakes in a basket, but not pulse; \n And wine into a bladder, but not crabs: \n But into this accursed belly, men \n Put every sort of inconsistent thing. \n I add no more; since it is plain enough \n That all men's errors are produced by it.' \n And Crates the Cynic, as Sosicrates tells us in his Successions,\n reproached Demetrius Phalereus for sending him a wallet of bread with a flagon of\n wine. I wish, said he, that the fountains bore\n bread. And Stilpo did not think himself guilty of intemperance when,\n having eaten garlic, he went to sleep in the temple of the Mother of the Gods; but\n all who eat of that food were forbidden even to enter into it. But when the\n goddess appeared to him in his sleep, and said, O Stilpo, do you, though\n you are a philosopher, transgress the Law? he thought that he made\n answer to her (still being asleep), Do you give me something better to eat,\n and I will not eat garlic. \n \n ","19":"\n After this, Ulpian said,\u2014Since we have feasted ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ) . . . .And Alexis, in his Curis, has used this\n expression, where he says\u2014 \n Since we have long since supp'd ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ); \n and so has Eubulus, in his Procris\u2014 \n But we have not yet supp'd ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ); \n and in another passage he says\u2014 \n A man who ought long since to have had supper ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n \n And Antiphanes, in his Leonidas, says\u2014 \n He will be here before we've finish'd supper ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And Aristophanes, in his Proagon, says\u2014 \n It's time for me to go now to my master, \n For by this time I think they all have supp'd ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And in his Danaides he says\u2014 \n You now are insulting me in a drunken manner \n Before you've supp'd ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And Plato, in his Sophist, and Epicrates of Ambracia (and this last is a\n poet of the middle comedy), in his Amazons, says\u2014 \n For these men seem to me to have had their supper ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ) \n In capital season. \n And, on the same principle, Aristophanes has given us the form \u1f20\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, in his Men Frying\u2014 \n We've drank our fill, my men, and well have dined ( \u1f20\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ). \n And Hermippus, in his Soldiers, says\u2014 \n To dine ( \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ), and come to this man's\n house. \n And Theopompus, in his Call\u00e6schrus, says\u2014 \n We've dined ( \u1f20\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd );\u2014for I must this\n discourse cut short. \n But, in his Politician, Antipho has used the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1fb6\u03bd, saying\u2014 \n When any one has all consumed in dinners ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd ) \n His own estate, and that of all his family. \n And Amphis has used the word \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, in his Vagabond, saying\u2014 \n The boys who long ago have lost their dinner ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ). \n \n \n ","20":"\n \n Let us, then, now, as Plato says in his Philebus, pray to\n the gods, and pour libations to them, whether it be Bacchus, or Vulcan, or\n whoever else of the gods it may be, who has had the honour of having our cups\n mixed for his sake. For there are two fountains by us, as if we were cupbearers\n to mix the wine: and a person might compare a fountain of pleasure to honey;\n but the fountain of wisdom, which is a sober and wine-eschewing spring, to that\n of some hard but wholesome water, which we must be very earnest to mix as well\n as possible. It is, then, time for us now to drink wine; and let some\n one of the slaves bring us goblets from the sideboard, for I see here a great\n variety of beautiful and variously-ornamented drinking-cups. Accordingly, when a\n large cup had been given to him, he said,\u2014But, O boy, draw\n out and pour into my cup a liquor with not quite so much water in it; not like the\n man in the comic poet Antiphanes, who, in the Twins, says\u2014 \n He took and brought me an enormous cup, \n And I pour'd into it unmixed wine, \n Not to the honour of a boy, but all \n My cups, and they were numberless, I quaff'd \n To all the gods and goddesses of heaven. \n Then, after them, I drank twice as much more \n To the great goddess and the noble king. \n So do you now, O boy, pour me out something stronger; for I do not\n prescribe to you the exact number of cyathi. But I will show you that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \n and \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (wine with less water in it) are\n both used: and then, too, I will give you a lecture about cupbearers. \n ","21":"\n But, first of all, I will speak about the habit of drinking strong drinks, with\n reference to which we find the word \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \n Antiphanes, in his Milanion, says\u2014 \n I think this man does drink the cup of health, \n Making his cupbearer shun too much water ( \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u1ff3\n \u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03cc\u1ff3 ). \n And in his Lampon he says\u2014 \n My friend Iapyx, mix it somewhat stronger ( \u03b5\u1f50\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Ephippus, in his Ephebi, says\u2014 \n He gave him in each hand a brimming flagon, \n Mixing in strong wine ( \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ), in\n Homer's fashion. \n And you find some people say that the expression in Homer\u2014 \n Take care and give less water ( \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\n \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5 ), \n does not mean that there is to be less water, but that the draught is to\n be hot; urging that \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 is derived from \n \u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 (giving life), and from \u03b6\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (boiling);\u2014for that, as there were companions\n present, it would have been absurd to begin mixing the cups of wine over again.\n But some say that the word is to be understood as equivalent to \u03b5\u1f54\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd (well-mixed); just as we find the form \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd used instead of \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd. And some say that, since the year is called \u1f67\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, and since the particle \u03b6\u03b1 indicates magnitude or number, \u03b6\u1ff6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 means merely what has been made many years. And Diphilus, in\n his Pederast\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Pour me now out a cup of wine to drink; \n Give it, by Jove! \u03b5\u1f50\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd than that; \n For wat'ry things are ruinous to the stomach. \n And Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drinking, says that \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd means mixed; quoting the following lines of\n Empedocles;\u2014 \n And soon the things which formerly they learnt \n Immortal were, did mortal now become, \n And things unmix'd before became now mix'd ( \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u1f70, ) \n Changing their previous ways and habits all. \n \n \n ","22":"\n And Plato has used the word \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 in the sense of\n a ladle, in his Phaon, where he says\u2014 \n Taking up thus the ladle ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) in their\n mouths. \n And in his Ambassadors he says\u2014 \n He stole the ladles ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 ) every time he\n could. \n And Archippus, in his Fishes, says\u2014 \n I bought a ladle ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) there from\n D\u00e6sias. \n And there is a similar use of the word in the Peace of Aristophanes:\u2014\n \n All having fought till they had got black eyes, \n Lying all on the ground around the \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9; \n \n for black eyes are reduced by having \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 (cupping glasses) applied to them. Xenophon also speaks of\n the \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 in the first book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia; and\n so does Cratinus; and, besides, so does Aristophanes in many places, and Eubulus\n in his Orthanna; and Pherecrates, in his Triflers, has spoken of a \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 made of silver. But Timon, in the second book of\n his History of the Silli, has called \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9,\n \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; speaking thus:\u2014 \n And \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, hard to fill with wine; \n naming them so from the verb \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to\n draw.

And this is\n that Apollo in whose honour they celebrate the Thargelian festival; and a\n writing concerning them is kept at Phyl\u00e6, in the Daphnephorium. And\n Hieronymus the Rhodian gives the same account, who was a disciple of Aristotle,\n and that too in a book of his entitled a Treatise on Drunkenness. And the\n beautiful Sappho often praises her brother Larichus, as having acted as cupbearer\n to the Mitylen\u00e6ans in the Prytaneum. And among the Romans, the most nobly born of\n the youths perform this office in the public sacrifices, imitating the Aeolians in\n everything, as even in the tones of their voices. \n ","24":"\n And so great was the luxury of the ancients in respect of their sumptuous meals,\n that they not only had cupbearers, but also men whom they called \u0153nopt\u00e6\n (inspectors of wines). At all events, the office of \u0153nopt\u00e6 is a regular office\n among the Athenians; and it is mentioned by Eupolis, in his play called The\n Cities, in the following lines\u2014 \n And men whom heretofore you'd not have thought \n Fit e'en to make \u0153nopt\u00e6 of, we now \n See made commanders. But oh, city, city! \n How much your fortune does outrun your sense. \n And these \u0153nopt\u00e6 superintended the arrangement of banquets, taking care\n that the guests should drink on equal terms. But it was an office of no great\n dignity, as Philinus the orator tells us, in his debate on the Croconid\u00e6. And he\n tells us, too, that the \u0153nopt\u00e6 were three in number, and that they also provided\n the guests with lamps and wicks. And some. people called them eyes; \n but among the Ephesians, the youths who acted as cupbearers at the festival of\n Neptune were called bulls, as Amerias tells us. And the people of\n the Hellespont call the cupbearer \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03b3\u03c7\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, or\n the pourer out; and they call carving, which we call \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \n \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, as Demetrius of Scepsis tells us, in\n the twenty-sixth book of his Arrangement of the Trojan Forces. And some say that\n the nymph Harmonia acted as cupbearer to the gods; as Capito the epic poet relates\n (and he was a native of Alexandria by birth), in the second book of his Love\n Poems. But Alc\u00e6us also represents Mercury as their cupbearer; as also does Sappho,\n who says\u2014 \n And with ambrosia was a goblet mix'd, \n And Mercury pour'd it out to all the gods. \n \n \n \n ","25":"\n But the ancients used to call the men who discharged this office, heralds\n ( \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 ). Homer says\u2014 \n Meanwhile the heralds through the crowded town \n Bring the rich wine and destined victims down. \n Id\u00e6us's arms the golden goblets prest, \n Who thus the venerable king addrest. \n And a few lines further on he says\u2014 \n On either side a sacred herald stands; \n The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands \n Pour the full urn. \n But Clidemus says that the cooks used to be called heralds. And some\n people have represented Hebe as acting as cupbearer to the gods, perhaps because\n their banquets were called Hebeteria. And Ptolemy, the son of Agesarchus, speaks\n of a damsel named Cleino as the cupbearer of Ptolemy the king, who was surnamed\n Philadelphus, mentioning her in the third book of his History of Philopator. But\n Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History, adds that there are statues of\n her in Alexandria, in many parts of the city, clad in a tunic alone, holding a cup\n in her hand. \n ","26":"\n And so, after this conversation, Ulpian drinking a goblet of wine, said\u2014 \n I drink this cup, a pledge of friendship dear, \n To all my kinsmen, naming them. \n And while he was still drinking, one of those who were present quoted the\n rest of the passage\u2014 \n When I have drunk, I'll say \n The rest; for I am choked: but now drink this. \n And Ulpian, when he had drunk it up, said,\u2014Clearchus has these lines in\n his Harp Player; but I, as is said in the Wool-spinners of Amphis, recommend\u2014\n \n Let the boy wait on all with frequent goblets. \n And again\u2014 \n You fill for me, and I will give you drink; \n So shall the almond with the almond play: \n as Xenarchus says, in his Twins. And accordingly, where some of the\n guests asked for more wine, and others wished to have it mixed half-and-half, and\n when some one mentioned that Archippus, in the second edition of his Amphitryon,\n said\u2014 \n Wretch, who has mix'd for you this half-and-half? \n \n and that Cratinus had said\u2014 \n Giving him half-and-half; but I'm undone; \n every one seemed to agree to speak of the way of mixing wine among the\n ancients. \n ","27":"\n And when some one mentioned that Menander, in his Hero, said\u2014 \n Here is a measure of well-temper'd wine; \n Take it, and drink it up;\u2014 \n Democritus said\u2014Hesiod, my friends, recommends men \n To pour three parts of water in the cup, \n And let the fourth part be the vinous juice. \n And, perhaps, it was on account of Hesiod that Anaxilas said, in his\n Nereus,\u2014 \n And this is much more pleasant; for I'd never \n Have drunk one part of wine to three of water. \n And Alexis, in his Nurse, recommends even a more moderate mixture than\n this\u2014 \n See, here is wine. Shall I, then, give to Criton \n Equal proportions? This is better far, \n One part of wine to four of limpid water: \n Perhaps you'll call that weak; but still, when you \n Have drunk your fill of this, you'll find your head \n Clear for discussion,\u2014and the drink lasts longer. \n And Diocles, in his Bees, says\u2014 \n \n A. In what proportions should the wine be mix'd? \n \n B. Four parts of water to two parts of wine. \n And this mixture, as it is not that in ordinary use, put the questioner\n in mind of the well-known proverb,\u2014 \n Drink waters three or five; but never four. \n That they mean is, You had better take two parts wine with five of water,\n or one of wine to three of water. But, concerning this mixture, Ion the poet, in\n his book on Chios, says that Palamedes the soothsayer discovered and prophesied to\n the Greeks, that they would have a favourable voyage if they drank one portion of\n wine to three of water. But they, applying themselves to their drink very\n vigorously, took two pints of wine to five of water;\u2014accordingly Nicochares in his\n Amymone, playing on the name, says\u2014 \n Here, you \u0152nornaus,\u2014here. you two and five,\u2014 \n Let you and I now have a drink together. \n And he said nearly the same in his Lemnian Women: and Ameipsias, in his\n Men Playing the Cottabus, says\u2014 \n \n But I (it is Bacchus who is represented as speaking) am five and two to all\n of you. \n And Eupolis says, in his Goats,\u2014 \n Hail, my friend Bacchus, are you two to five? \n And Hermippus says, in his Gods,\u2014 \n \n A. Then, when we drink, or when we thirsty are, \n We pray our wine may be in due proportion. \n \n B. I do not bring it from a roguish wine-vault, \n Meaning to mock you: this which I do bring \n Is, as before, the proper two and five. \n \n \n ","28":"\n But in Anacreon we find one measure of wine to two of water spoken of\u2014 \n Come, my boy, and bring to me \n Such a cup as I may drink \n At one easy draught: pour in \n Ten cyathi of water pure, \n And five of richest Chian wine; \n That I may drink, from fear removed, \n And free from drunken insolence. \n And going on presently, he calls the drinking of unmixed wine, a Scythian\n draught\u2014 \n Come hither, now, and let us not \n Give way to vulgar shouts and noise, \n Indulging in the Scythian draughts \n While o'er our wine; but let us drink, \n Singing well-omen'd, pious hymns. \n And the Laced\u00e6monians, according to the statement of Herodotus, in his\n sixth book, say that Cleomenes the king, having lived among the Scythians, and got\n the habit of drinking unmixed wine, became perfectly mad from his habit of\n drunkenness. And the Laced\u00e6monians themselves, when they take it into their heads\n to drink hard, say that they are Episcythising. Accordingly, Cham\u00e6leon of\n Heraclea, in his book on Drunkenness, writes thus concerning them:\u2014 Since\n the Laced\u00e6monians say also, that Cleomenes the Spartan became ma d from having\n lived among the Scythians, and there learnt to drink unmixed wine; on which\n account, when they take a fancy to drink unmixed wine they desire their slaves\n to pour out in the Scythian fashion. And Ach\u00e6us, in his Aethon, a\n satyric drama, represents the Satyrs as indignant at being compelled to drink\n their wine watered, and as saying\u2014 \n Was the whole Achelous in this wine? \n But even then this race would not cease drinking, \n For this is all a Scythian's happiness. \n \n \n \n ","29":"\n But the habit of pouring libations of pure wine, as Theophrastus says, in his\n treatise on Drinking, was not ancient; but originally libations were what is given\n to the Gods, and the cottabus, what was devoted to the object of one's love. For\n men practised throwing the cottabus with great care, it being originally a\n Sicilian sport, as Anacreon - the Teian says\u2014 \n Throwing, with his well-bent arm \n The Sicilian cottabus. \n On which account those songs of the ancient poets, which are called\n scolia, are full of mention of the cottabus. I mean, for instance, such a scolion as Pindar composed\u2014 \n And rightly I adore the Graces, \n Nymphs of Venus and of Love, \n While drinking with a loving heart \n This sounding cottabus I pour \n To Agathon, my heart's delight. \n And they also consecrated to those of their friends who were dead, all\n that portion of their victuals which fell from their tables. On which account\n Euripides says of Sthenoboea, when she thinks that Bellerophon is dead\u2014 \n Nothing escaped her from her hand which fell, \n But in a moment she did couple it \n With the loved name of the Corinthian stranger. \n \n \n ","30":"\n But the ancients were not in the habit of getting drunk. But Pittacus recommended\n Periander of Priene not to get drunk, nor to become too much addicted to feasting,\n so that, says he, it may not be discovered what sort of a\n person you really are, and that you are not what you\n pretend to be. \u2014 \n For brass may be a mirror for the face,\u2014 \n Wine for the mind. \n On which account they were wise men who invited the proverb, Wine\n has no rudder. Accordingly, Xenophon the son of Gryllus, (when once at\n the table of Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily, the cupbearer was compelling the\n guests to drink,) addressed the tyrant himself by name, and said, Why, O\n Dionysius, does not also the confectioner, who is a skilful man in his way, and\n one who understands a great many different recipes for dressing things, compel\n us also, when we are at a banquet, to eat even when we do not wish to; but why,\n on the contrary, does he spread the table for us in an orderly manner, in\n silence? And Sophocles, in one of his Satyric dramas, says\u2014 \n To be compell'd to drink is quite as hard \n As to be forced to bear with thirst. \n From which also is derived the saying\u2014 \n Wine makes an old man dance against his will. \n And Sthenelus the poet said very well\u2014 \n Wine can bring e'en the wise to acts of folly. \n And Phocylides says\u2014 \n It should be a rule for all wine-bibbing people \n Not to let the jug limp round the board like a cripple, \n But gaily to chat while enjoying their tipple: \n and to this day this custom prevails among some of the Greeks. But since\n they have begun to be luxurious and have got effeminate they have given up their\n chairs and taken to couches; and having taken indolence and laziness for their\n allies, they have indulged in drinking in an immoderate and disorderly manner; the\n very way in which the tables were laid contributing, as I imagine, to luxury. \n ","31":"\n And it is on this account that Hesiod, in his Eo\u00e6, has said\u2014 \n What joys and also what exceeding pains \n Has Bacchus given to mortal men who drink, \n Indulging in excess: for to such men \n Wine is an insolent master, binding fast' \n Their feet and hands, their tongues and intellects, \n With chains unspeakable, unnoticeable; \n And tender sleep loves on their eyes to fall. \n \n And Theognis says\u2014 \n I come like wine, the sweetest drink of men,\u2014 \n I am not sober, nor yet very drunk; \n But he who goes to great excess in drink \n Is no more master of his mind or senses; \n Then he talks unintelligible nonsense, \n Which seems to sober men a shameful thing; \n But he, when drunk, is not ashamed of anything, \n E'en though at other times a modest man \n And gentle-minded. Mind you this, my friend, \n And don't indulge in drinking to excess, \n But rise from table ere the wine begins \n To take effect; nor let your appetite \n Reduce you to become its daily slave. \n But Anacharsis the philosopher, wishing to exhibit the power of the vine\n to the king of the Scythians, and showing him some of its branches, said that if\n the Greeks did not prune it every year it would by this time have reached to\n Scythia. \n ","32":"\n But those men do not act wisely who represent and describe Bacchus in their\n statues or pictures, and who also lead him through the middle of the market-place\n on a waggon, as if he were drunk; for, by so doing, they show the beholders that\n wine is stronger than the god. And I do not think that even a good and wise man\n could stand this. And if they have represented him in this state because he first\n showed us the use of wine, it is plain that for the same reason they should always\n represent Ceres as reaping corn or eating bread. And I should say that Aeschylus\n himself erred in this particular; for he was the first person (and not Euripides,\n as some people say,) who introduced the appearance of drunken people into a\n tragedy. For in his Cabiri he introduces Jason drunk. But the fact is, that the\n practices which the tragedian himself used to indulge in, he attributed to his\n heroes: at all events he used to write his tragedies when he was drunk; on which\n account Sophocles used to reproach him, and say to him, O Aeschylus, \n even if you do what you ought, at all events you do so\n without knowing it; as Cham\u00e6leon tells us, in his treatise on\n Aeschylus. And they are ignorant people who say that Epiharmus was the first\n person who introduced a drunken man on the stage, and after him Crates, in his\n Neighbours. And Alc\u00e6us the lyric poet, and Aristophanes the comic poet, used o\n write their poems when they were drunk. And many other men have fought with great\n gallantry in war when they were drunk. But among the Epizephyrian Locrians, if any\n one drank untempered wine, except by the express command of his physician for the\n sake of his health, he was liable to be punished with death, in accordance with a\n law to that effect passed by Zalericus. \n And among the people of Massilia there was a law that the women should drink water\n only. And Theophrastus says, that to this day that is the law at Miletus. And\n among the Romans no slave ever drank wine, nor any free woman, nor any youth born\n of free parents till he was thirty years of age. And Anacreon is very ridiculous\n for having referred all his poems to the subject of drunkenness; for, owing to\n this, he is found fault with as having in his poems wholly abandoned himself to\n effeminacy and luxury, as the multitude are not aware that while he wrote he was a\n sober and virtuous man, who pretended to be a drunkard, when there was no\n necessity at all for his doing so. \n ","33":"\n And men who are ignorant of the power of wine, say that Bacchus is the cause of\n madness to men; in saying which they abuse wine in a very senseless manner. On\n which account Melanippides says\u2014 \n All men have detested water \n Who did not before have wine; \n And though some have enjoy'd their cups, \n Others have turn'd to ravings wild. \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drinking, says, If the wine be\n moderately boiled, then when it is drunk, it is less pt to intoxicate; for, as\n some of its power has been boiled away, it has become weaker. And he\n also says, \"Old men become drunk more quickly on account of the small quantity of\n natural warmth which there is in them, and also of the weak \n ness of what there is. And again, those who are very young get drunk very quickly,\n on account of the great quantity of natural warmth that there is in them; for, in\n consequence, they are easily subdued by the warmth proceeding from the wine which\n is added to their natural warmth. And some of the brute beasts are also capable of\n becoming intoxicated; such as pigs when they are filled with the husks of pressed\n grapes; and the whole race of crows, and of dogs, when they have eaten of the herb\n called cenussa: and the monkey and the elephant get intoxicated if they drink\n wine; on which account they hunt monkeys and crows when the former have been made\n drunk with wine, and the latter with \u0153nussa. \n But to drink unceasingly\u2014 \n as Crobylus says, in his Woman who deserted her Husband\u2014 \n Can have \n No pleasure in it, surely; how should it, \n When it deprives a living man of power \n To think as he should think? and yet is thought \n The greatest blessing that is given to man. \n And Alexis, in the revised edition of his Phrygian, says\u2014 \n If now men only did their headaches get \n Before they get so drunk, I'm sure that no one \n Would ever drink more than a moderate quantity: \n But now we hope t' escape the penalty \n Of our intemperance, and so discard \n Restraint, and drink unmixed cups of wine. \n And Aristotle says, that the wine called the Samagorean wine was so\n strong that more than forty men were made drunk with a pint and a half of it after\n it had been mixed with water. \n ","34":"\n Democritus having said this, and having drunk, said,\u2014 Now if any one can gainsay\n any of these statements let him come forward: and then he shall be told, as Evenus\n says\u2014 \n That may be your opinion; this is mine. \n But I, since I have now made this digression about the mix- tures of the\n ancients, will resume the thread of my original discourse where I let it drop;\n considering what was said by Alc\u00e6us the lyric poet. For he speaks, somewhere or\n other, in this way\u2014 \n Pour out, in just proportion, one and two. \n For in these words some people do not think that he is alluding to the\n mixture of wine and water at all; but that, being a moderate and temperate man, he\n would not drink more than one cyathus of pure wine, or\n perhaps, at the most, two. And this is the interpretation given to the passage by\n Chameleon of Pontus, who was ignorant how fond of wine Alc\u00e6us had been. For this\n poet will be found to have been in the habit of drinking at every season and in\n every imaginable condition of affairs. In winter he speaks thus\u2014 \n Now the storm begins to lower, \n And Jove descends in heavy snow, \n And streams of water stand congeal'd \n In cruel ice: let's drive away \n The wintry cold, and heap up fire, \n And mingle with unsparing hand \n The honied cup, and wreathe our brows \n With fragrant garlands of the season. \n And in summer, he writes\u2014 \n Now it behoves a man to soak his lungs \n In most cool wine; for the fierce dogstar rages, \n And all things thirst with the excessive heat. \n And in spring he says\u2014 \n Now does the flowery spring return, \n And shed its gifts all o'er the land; \n and he continues\u2014 \n Come then, my boy, and quickly pour \n A cup of luscious Lesbian wine. \n And in his misfortunes he sings\u2014 \n One must not give one's thoughts up wholly \n To evil fortune; for by grieving \n We shall not do ourselves much good. \n Come to me, Bacchus; you are ever \n The best of remedies, who bring \n Us wine and joyous drunkenness. \n And in his hours of joy he says\u2014 \n Now is the time to get well drunk, \n Now e'en in spite of self to drink, \n Since Myrsilus is dead at last. \n And, giving some general advice, he says\u2014 \n Never plant any tree before the vine. \n \n \n How, then, could a man who was so very devoted to drinking be a sober man, and be\n content with one or two cups of wine? At all events, his very poem, says Seleucus,\n testifies against those people who receive the line in this sense. For he says, in\n the whole passage\u2014 \n Let us now drink,\u2014why put we out the light? \n Our day is but a finger: bring large cups, \n \n Fili'd with the purple juice of various grapes; \n For the great son of Semele and Jove \n Gave wine to men to drive away their cares. \n Pour on, in just proportion, one and two, \n And let one goblet chase another quickly \n Out of my head. \n In which words he plainly enough intimates that his meaning is, that one\n cup of wine is to be mixed with two of water. \n ","35":"\n But Anacreon likes his liquors stronger still; as is shown by the verses in which\n he says\u2014 \n Let the cup well be clean'd, then let it hold \n Five measures water, three of rosy wine. \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Tereus, speaks of two measures of water to three\n of wine. And he speaks thus,\u2014 \n I seem to have drunk two measures now of water, \n And only three of wine. \n And Pherecrates, in his Corianno, speaks even of two measures of water to\n four of wine, and says\u2014 \n \n A. Throw that away, my dear; the fellow has \n Given you such a watery mixture. \n \n B. Nay rather, 'tis mere water and nought else. \n \n A. What have you done?\u2014in what proportions, \n You cursed man, have you this goblet mix'd? \n \n B. I've put two waters only in, my mother. \n \n A. And how much wine? \n \n B. Four parts of wine, I swear. \n \n A. You're fit to serve as cupbearer to the\n frogs. \n And Ephippus, in his Circe, says\u2014 \n \n A. You will find it a much more prudent mixture, \n To take three parts of one, and four of th' other. \n \n B. That's but a watery mixture, three to four. \n \n A. Would you, then, quite unmix'd your wine\n prefer? \n \n B. How say you? \n \n \n ","36":"\n And Timocles speaks of half and half in his Conisalus,\u2014 \n And I'll attack you straight with half and half, \n And make you tell me all the truth at once. \n And Alexis, in his Dorcis, or the Caressing Woman, says\u2014 \n I drink now cups brimming with love to you, \n Mixed in fair proportions, half and half. \n And Xenarchus, or Timocles, in his Purple, says\u2014 \n By Bacchus, how you drink down half and half! \n And Sophilus, in his Dagger, says,\u2014 \n And wine was given in unceasing flow, \n Mix'd half and half; and yet, unsatisfied, \n They ask'd for larger and for stronger cups. \n \n And Alexis, in his play entitled The Usurer, or Liar, says\u2014\n \n \n A. Don't give him wine quite drown'd in water,\n now;\u2014 \n Dost understand me? Half and half, or nearly: \n That's well. \n \n B. A noble drink: where was the land \n That raised this noble Bacchus by its flavour, \n I think he came from Thasos. \n \n A. Sure 'tis just \n That foreigners should foreign wines enjoy, \n And that the natives should drink native produce. \n And again, in his Supposititious Son, he says\u2014 \n He drank and never drew his breath, as one \n Would quaff rich wine, mix'd half and half with care. \n And Menander, in his Brethren\u2014 \n Some one cried out to mingle eight and twelve, \n Till he with rivalry subdued the other ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 ). \n And the verb \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c9 was especially used\n of those who fell down from drinking, taking its metaphor from the shaking down\n fruit from the tree. \n And Alexis, in his Man cut off, says\u2014 \n He was no master of the feast at all, \n But a mere hangman, Ch\u00e6reas his name; \n And when he'd drunk full twenty cups of wine, \n Mix'd half and half, he ask'd for more, and stronger. \n \n \n ","37":"\n And Diodorus of Sinope, in his Female Flute-player, says\u2014 \n When any one, O Crito, drinks ten cups, \n Consider, I do beg you, whether he \n Who never once allows the wine to pass \n Is in a fit state for discussion. \n \n \n And it was not without some wit that Lysander the Spartan, as Hegesander relates\n in his Commentaries, when some vintners sold wine which had been much watered in\n hi camp, ordered some one to supply it properly tempered, that his men might buy\n it with less water in it. And Alexis has said something which comes to nearly the\n same thing, in his Aesop; thus\u2014 \n \n A. That is a good idea of yours, O Solon, \n And cleverly imagined, which you have \n Adopted in your city. \n \n S. What is that? \n \n A. You don't let men drink neat wine at their\n feasts. \n \n S. Why, if I did, 'twould not be very easy \n For men to get it, when the innkeepers \n \n Water it ere it comes out of the waggon. \n No doubt they do not do so to make money, \n But only out of prudent care for those \n Who buy the liquor; so that they may have \n Their heads from every pang of headache free. \n This now is, as you see, a Grecian drink; \n So that men, drinking cups of moderate strength, \n May chat and gossip cheerfully with each other: \n For too much water is more like a bath \n Than like a wine-cup; and the wine-cooler \n Mix'd with the cask, my friend, is death itself. \n \n \n ","38":"\n \n But to drink to the degree of drunkenness, says Plato, in his sixth\n book of the Laws, is neither becoming any- Where\u2014except perhaps in the days of\n festival of the god who gave men wine for their banquets,\u2014nor is it wholesome:\n and, above all, a man ought to guard against such a thing who has any thoughts of\n marriage; for at such a time, above all other times, both bride and bridegroom\n ought to be in full possession of their faculties; when they are entering upon\n what is no small change in the circumstances of their life; and also they ought to\n be influenced by anxiety that their offspring shall be the offspring of parents in\n the fullest possible possession of all their faculties; for it is very uncertain\n what day or what night will be the originating cause of it. And in the\n first book of his Laws he says\u2014 But respecting drunkenness it may be a\n question, whether we ought to give way to it as the Lydians do, and the Persians,\n and the Carthaginians, and the Celt\u00e6, and the Spaniards, and the Thracians, and\n other nations like them; or whether like you, O Laced\u00e6monians, one ought wholly to\n abstain from it. But the Scythians and the Thracians, who indulge altogether in\n drinking unmixed wine, both the women and all the men, and who spill it all over\n their clothes, think that they are maintaining a very honourable practice, and one\n that tends to their happiness. And the Persians indulge to a great extent in other\n modes of luxury which you reject; but still they practise them with more\n moderation than the Scythians and Thracians. \n ","39":"\n And a great many of the guests were drinking, and putting lumps of meal into their\n wine, a custom which Hegesander of Delphi mentions. Accordingly Epinicus, when\n Mnesiptolemus had given a recitation of his history, in which it was written how\n Seleucus had used meal in his wine, having written a drama\n entitled Mnesiptolemus, and having turned him into ridicule, as the comic poets\n do, and using his own words about that sort of drink, represents him as saying:\u2014\n \n Once I beheld the noble king Seleucus, \n One summer's day, drinking with mighty pleasure \n Some wine with meal steep'd in it. (So I took \n A note of it, and show'd it to a crowd, \n Although it was an unimportant thing, \n Yet still my genius could make it serious.) \n He took some fine old Thasian wine, and eke \n Some of the liquor which the Attic bee \n Distils who culls the sweets from every flower; \n And that he mingled in a marble cup, \n And mix'd the liquor with fair Ceres' corn, \n And took the draught, a respite from the heat. \n And the same writer tells us that in the Therades islands men mash\n lentils and pease into meal, instead of ordinary corn, and put that into the wine,\n and that this drink is said to be better than that in which the meal is mixed. \n ","40":"\n Now it was not the fashion among the Laced\u00e6monians to practise the system of\n pledging healths at their banquets, nor to salute one another with mutual\n greetings and caresses at their feasts. And Critias shows us this in his Elegies:\u2014\n \n And this is an old fashion, well establish'd, \n And sanction'd by the laws of noble Sparta, \n That all should drink from one well-fill'd cup; \n And that no healths should then be drunk to anyone, \n Naming the tender object: also that \n The cup should not go round towards the right. \n The Lydian goblets . . . . \n * * * * \n And to drink healths with skill and well-turn'd phrase, \n Naming the person whom one means to pledge. \n For, after draughts like this, the tongue gets loose, \n And turns to most unseemly conversation; \n They make the body weak; they throw a mist \n Over the eyes; and make forgetfulness \n Eat recollection out of the full heart. \n The mind no longer stands on solid ground; \n The slaves are all corrupted by licentiousness, \n And sad extravagance eats up the house. \n But those wise youths whom Laced\u00e6mon breeds \n Drink only what may stimulate their souls \n To deeds of daring in th' adventurous war, \n And rouse the tongue to wit and moderate mirth. \n Such draughts are wholesome both for mind and body, \n \n And not injurious to the pocket either: \n Good, too, for deeds of love; authors of sleep, \n That wholesome harbour after toil and care: \n Good, too, for health-that best of goddesses \n Who mortal man befriend: and likewise good \n For piety's best neigbour temperance. \n And presently afterwards he goes on\u2014 \n For fierce, immoderate draughts of heady wine \n Give momentary pleasure, but engender \n A long-enduring pain which follows it. \n But men at Sparta love a mode of life \n Which is more equal; they but eat and drink \n That which is wholesome, so that they may be \n Fit to endure hard pains, and do great deeds. \n Nor have they stated days in all the year \n When it is lawful to indulge too much. \n \n \n ","41":"\n And a man who is always ready for wine is called \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. . But he is called \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 who is always ready to drink anything; and he is called\n \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03c9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 who drinks to the degree of\n drunkenness. And of all heroes, the greatest drinker is Nestor, who lived three\n times as long as other men; for he evidently used to stick to his wine more\n closely than other people, and even than Agamemnon himself, whom Achilles upbraids\n as a man given to much drinking. But Nestor, even when a most important battle was\n impending, could not keep away from drinking. Accordingly Homer says\u2014 \n But not the genial feast or flowing bowl \n Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul. \n And he is the only hero whose drinking-cup he has described, as he has\n the shield of Achilles; for he went to the war with his goblet just as he did with\n that shield, the fame of which Hector says had reached to heaven. And a man would\n not be very wrong who called that cup of his the Goblet of Mars, like the C\u00e6neus\n of Antiphanes, in which it is said\u2014 \n The hero stood and brandish'd Mars's cup, \n Like great Timotheus, and his polish'd spear. \n And indeed it was on account of his fondness for drinking that Nestor, in\n the games instituted in honour of Patroclus, received a drinking-cup as a present\n from Achilles; not but what Achilles also gave a cup to the competitor who was\n defeated: for victory does not commonly attend hard drinkers, on account of their\n usual inactivity; or perhaps it is owing to their thirst that boxers usually fail,\n from being fatigued with holding out their hands too long.\n But Eumelus receives a breastplate after having run a course with great danger,\n and having been torn, the breastplate being a serviceable piece of defensive\n armour. \n ","42":"\n But there is nothing more covetous than thirst; on which account the poet has\n called Argos thirsty, or rather causing great thirst, as having been much desired\n on account of the length of time the person of whom he is speaking had been absent\n from it. For thirst engenders in all men a violent desire for abundant enjoyment;\n on which account Sophocles says\u2014 \n Though you were to unfold unnumber'd treasures \n Of wisdom to a thirsty man, you'd find \n You pleased him less than if you gave him drink. \n And Archilochus says\u2014 \n I wish to fight with you, as much as e'er \n A thirsty man desired to quench his thirst. \n And one of the tragic poets has said\u2014 \n I bid you check your hand which thirsts for blood. \n And Anacreon says\u2014 \n For you are kind to every stranger, \n So let me drink and quench my thirst. \n And Xenophon, in the third book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia, represents Cyrus as\n speaking in this manner:\u2014 I thirst to gratify you. And Plato, in his\n Polity, says\u2014 But if, as I imagine, any city which is governed by a\n democracy, thirsting for its liberty, should have evil-disposed cupbearers to\n wait upon it, and should be intoxicated to an improper degree with unmixed wine\n . . . . \n \n ","43":"\n Proteas the Macedonian was also a very great drinker, as Ephippus tells us in his\n treatise on the Funeral of Alexander and Heph\u00e6stion: and he had an admirable\n constitution, and he had practised drinking to a great degree. Accordingly,\n Alexander, having once asked for a cup containing two choes, and having drank from\n it, pledged Proteas; and he, having taken it, and having sung the praises of the\n king a great deal, drank it in such a manner as to be applauded by every one. And\n presently Proteas asked for the same cup again, and again he drank and pledged the\n king. And Alexander, having taken the cup, drank it off in a princely manner, but\n he could not stand it, but leaned back on the pillow, letting\n the cup fall from his hands; and after this he fell sick and died, Bacchus, as it\n is said, being angry with him because he had besieged his native city of Thebes.\n And Alexander drank a great deal too, so that he once, after a drunken bout, slept\n without interruption two days and two nights. And this is shown in his Journals,\n which were compiled by Eumenes the Cardian, and Diodotus the Erythr\u00e6an. But\n Menander, in his Flatterer, says\u2014 \n \n A. My good friend, Struthias, I thrice have\n drunk \n A golden cup in Cappadocia, \n Containing ten full cotyl\u00e6 of wine. \n \n St. Why, then you drank more than king\n Alexander. \n \n A. At all events not less, I swear by Pallas. \n \n St. A wondrous feat. \n But Nicobule, or whoever it was who wrote the books attributed to her,\n says that Alexander, once supping with Medeus the Thessalian, when there\n were twenty people present at the party, pledged every one of the guests,\n receiving a similar pledge from all of them, and then, rising up from the\n party, he presently went off to sleep. And Callisthenes the Sophist, as\n Lynceus the Samian says in his Commentaries, and Aristobulus and Chares in their\n Histories, when in a banquet given by Alexander, a cup of unmixed wine came to\n him, rejected it; and when some one said to him, Why do you not drink? I do not\n wish, said he, after having drunk the cup of Alexander, to stand in need of the\n cup of Aesculapius.\" \n ","44":"\n But Darius, who destroyed the Magi, had an inscription written on his\n tomb,\u2014 I was able to drink a great deal of wine, and to bear it\n well. And Ctesias says, that among the Indians it is not lawful for the\n king to get drunk; but among the Persians it is permitted to the king to get drunk\n one day in the year,\u2014the day, namely, on which they sacrifice to Mithras. And\n Duris writes thus, with respect to this circumstance, in the seventh book of his\n Histories:\u2014\"The king gets drunk and dances the Persian dance on that festival only\n which is celebrated by the Persians in honour of Mithras; but no one else does so\n in all Asia; but all abstain during this day from dancing at all. For the Persians\n learn to dance as they learn to ride; and they think that the motion originated by\n this sort of exercise contains in it a good kind of practice tending to the\n strength of the body. But Alexander used to get so drunk, as\n Carystius of Pergamus relates in his Historic Commentaries, that he used even to\n celebrate banquets in a chariot drawn by asses; and the Persian kings too, says\n he, did the same thing. And perhaps it was owing to this that he had so little\n inclination for amatory pleasures; for Aristotle, in his Problems of Natural\n History, says, that the powers of men who drink to any great excess are much\n weakened. And Hieronymus, in his Letters, says, that Theophrastus says, that\n Alexander was not much of a man for women; and accordingly, when Olympias had\n given him Callixene, a Thessalian courtesan, for a mistress, who was a most\n beautiful woman, (and all this was done with the consent of Philip, for they were\n afraid that he was quite impotent,) she was constantly obliged to ask him herself\n to do his duty by her. \n ","45":"\n And Philip, the father of Alexander, was a man very fond of drinking, as\n Theopompus relates in the twenty-sixth book of his History. And in another part of\n his History he writes, Philip was a man of violent temper and fond of\n courting dangers, partly by nature, and partly too from drinking; for he was a\n very hard drinker, and very often he would attack the enemy while he was\n drunk. And in his fifty-third book, speaking of the things that took\n place at Ch\u00e6ronea, and relating how he invited to supper the ambassadors of the\n Athenians who were present there, he says, \"But Philip, when they had gone away,\n immediately sent for some of his companions, and bade the slaves summon the female\n flute-players, and Aristonicus the harp-player, and Durion the flute-player, and\n all the rest who were accustomed to drink with him; for Philip always took people\n of that sort about with him, and he had also invented for himself many instruments\n for banquets and drinking parties; for being very fond of drinking and a man\n intemperate in his manners, he used to keep a good many buffoons an musicians and\n professed jesters about him. And when he had spent the whole night in drinking,\n and had got very drunk and violent, he then dismissed all the rest, and when it\n was day-break proceeded in a riotous manner to the ambssadors of the Athenians.\n And Carystius in his Historical Commentaries says, that Philip, when he intended\n to get drunk, spoke in this way: Now we may drink; for it is quite\n sufficient if Antipater is sober. And once, when he was playing at dice, and some one told him that Antipater was coming, he\n hesitated a moment, and then thrust the board under the couch. \n ","46":"\n And Theopompus gives a regular catalogue of men fond of drinking and addicted to\n drunkenness; and among them he mentions the younger Dionysius, the tyrant of\n Sicily, whose eyes were a good deal injured by wine. And Aristotle, in his Polity\n of the Syracusans, says that he sometimes was drunk for three months at a time\n together, owing to which he had got somewhat weak in the eyes. And Theophrastus\n says that his companions also, who were flatterers of the supreme power, pretended\n not to see well, and to be led by the hand by Dionysius, and not to be able to see\n the meat that was served up before them, nor the cups of wine, on which account\n they got the name of Dionysiocolaces, or flatterers of Dionysius Nys\u00e6us also, who\n was tyrant of Syracuse, drank a great deal, and so did Apollocrates; and these men\n were the sons of the former Dionysius, as Theopompus tells us in the fortieth and\n forty-first books of his History; and he writes thus about Nys\u00e6us: Nys\u00e6us,\n who was afterwards tyrant of Syracuse, when he was taken for the purpose of\n being put to death, and knew that he had only a few months to live, spent them\n wholly in eating and drinking. And in his thirty-ninth book he says:\n Apollocrates, the son of Dionysius the tyrant, was an intemperate man,\n and addicted to drinking; and some of his flatterers worked upon him so as to\n alienate him as much as possible from his father. And he says that\n Hipparinus, the son of Dionysius, who behaved like a tyrant when drunk, was put to\n death. And about Nyssus he writes as follows: Nys\u00e6us, the son of the elder\n Dionysius, having made himself master of Syracuse, got a four-horse chariot,\n and put on an embroidered robe, and devoted himself to gluttony and hard\n drinking, and to insulting boys and ravishing women, and to all other acts\n which are consistent with such conduct. And he passed his life in this\n manner. And in his forty-fifth book the same historian, speaking of\n Timolaus the Theban, says: For though there have been a great many men who\n have been intemperate in their daily life, and in their drinking, I do not\n believe that there has ever been any one who was concerned in state affairs,\n more intemperate, or a greater glutton, or a more complete slave to his\n pleasures than Timolaus, whom I have mentioned. \n And in his twenty-third book, speaking of Charidemus of Oreum, whom the Athenians\n made a citizen, he says: For it was notorious that he spent every day in\n the greatest intemperance, and in such a manner that he was always drinking and\n getting drunk, and endeavoring to seduce free-born women; and he carried his\n intemperance to such a height that he ventured to beg a young boy, who was very\n beautiful and elegant, from the senate of the Olynthians, who had happened to\n be taken prisoner in the company of Derdas the Macedonian. \n \n ","47":"\n A man of the name of Arcadion, too, was a very great drinker, (but it is uncertain\n whether this is the same man who was at enmity with Philip,) as the epigram shows\n which Polemo has preserved in his treatise on the Inscriptions existing in\n different Cities\u2014 \n This is the monument of that great drinker, \n Arcadion; and his two loving sons, \n Dorcon and Charmylus, have placed it here, \n At this the entrance of his native city: \n And know, traveller, the man did die \n From drinking strong wine in too large a cup. \n And the inscription over some man of the name of Erasixenus says that he\n also drank a great deal. \n Twice was this cup, full of the strongest wine, \n Drain'd by the thirsty Erasixenus, \n And then in turn it carried him away. \n Alcetas the Macedonian also used to drink a great deal, as Aristos the\n Salaminian relates; and so did Diotimus the Athenian: and he was the man who was\n surnamed the Funnel. For he put a funnel into his mouth, and would then drink\n without ceasing while the wine was being poured into it, according to the account\n of Polemo. And it has been already mentioned that Cleomenes the Laced\u00e6monian was a\n great drinker of unmixed wine; and that in consequence of his drunkenness he cut\n himself to pieces with a sword, is related by Herodotus. And Alc\u00e6us the poet also\n was very fond of drinking, as I have already mentioned. And Baton of Sinope, in\n his essay on Ion the poet, says that Ion was a man fond of drinking and amorous to\n excess; and he himself, too, in his Elegies, confesses that he loved Chrysilla the\n Corinthian, the daughter of Teleas, with whom Teleclides, in his Hesiods, says\n that the Olympian Pericles also was in love. And\n Xenarchus the Rhodian, on account of the excessive way in\n which he used to drink, was surnamed The Nine-gallon Cask; and\n Euphorion the Epic poet mentions him in his Chiliades. \n ","48":"\n And Chares the Mitylen\u00e6an, in his History of Alexander, speaking of Calanus the\n Indian philosopher, and saying that he threw himself on a funeral pile that had\n been raised, and so died, says also that Alexander instituted some gymnastic games\n at his tomb, and also a musical contest of panegyrics on him.\u2014 And he\n instituted, says Chares, because of the great fondness of the\n Indians for wine, a contest as to who should drink the greatest quantity of\n unmixed wine; and the prize was a talent for the first, and thirty mince for\n the second, and ten mince for the third. And of those who entered for the prize\n and drank the wine, thirty-five died at once by reason of the cold; and a\n little afterwards six more died in their tents. And he who drank the greatest\n quantity and won the prize, drank four choes of unmixed wine, and received the\n talent; and he lived four days after it; and he was called the\n Champion. And Tim\u00e6us says that Dionysius the tyrant gave, at the\n festival of the Choes, to the first man who should drink a choeus, a golden\n crown as a prize: and he says also that Xenocrates the\n philosopher was the first person who drank it; and that he, taking the golden\n crown, and departing, offered it up to the Mercury who was placed in his\n vestibule, on which statue he was always accustomed on every occasion to offer\n up the garlands of flowers which he had, every evening as he returned home; and\n he was much admired for this conduct. And Phanodemus says, that the\n festival of the Choes was established at Athens by Demophoon the king, when he was\n desirous to receive Orestes in hospitality on his arrival at Athens. And that, as\n he did not like him to come to the temples, or to share in the libations offered\n to the gods, before his trial was decided, he ordered all the temples to be shut,\n and a choeus of wine to be set before everybody, saying that a cheesecake should\n be given as a prize to the first person who drank it up. And he bade them, when\n they had finished drinking, not to offer up the garlands, with which they had been\n crowned, in the temples, because they had been under the same roof with Orestes;\n but he desired each man to place his garland round his own cup, and so to bring\n them to the priestess at the temple which is in the Marshes, and after that to perform the rest of the sacred ceremonies in the\n temple. And from thence it was that this festival got the name of the Choes. But\n on the day of the festival of the Choes, it is customary for the Athenians to send\n presents and pay to the sophists, who also themselves invite their acquaintances\n to a banquet, as Eubulides the dialectician shows us in his drama entitled the\n Revellers, where he says\u2014 \n You're acting like a sophist now, you wretch, \n And long for the pay-giving feast of Choes. \n \n \n ","49":"\n But Antigonus the Carystian, in his essay on the Life of Dionysius of Heraclea,\n who was called the Turncoat, says that Dionysius, when he was feasting with his\n slaves at the festival of the Choes, and was not able, by reason of his old age,\n to avail himself of the courtesan whom they brought him, turned round and said to\n those who were feasting with him\u2014 \n I cannot now, so let another take her. \n But Dionysius, as Nicias of Nic\u00e6a tells us in his Successions, had been\n from the time he was a boy very furious in the indulgence of his amorous\n propensities; and he used to go to all the common women promiscuously. And once,\n when walking with some of his acquaintances, when he came near the house where the\n girls are kept, and where, having been there the day before, he had left some\n money owing, as he happened to have some with him then, he put out his hand and\n paid it in the presence of all of them. And Anacharsis the Scythian, when a prize\n for drinking was proposed at the table of Periander, demanded the prize, because\n he was the first man to be drunk of all the guests who were present; as if to get\n to the end were the goal to be aimed at and the victory to be achieved in drinking\n as in running a race. But Lacydes and Timon the philosophers, being invited to an\n entertainment which was to last two days, by one of their friends, and wishing to\n adapt themselves to the rest of the guests, drank with great eagerness. And\n accordingly, in the first day, Lacydes went away first, as soon as he was quite\n satiated with drink. And Timon, seeing him as he was departing, said\u2014 \n Now have we gain'd immortal praise and fame, \n Since we have slain great Hector. \n But on the next day Timon went away first because he could not drink up the goblet in which he had been pledged, and\n Lacydes seeing him departing, said\u2014 \n Wretched are they who dare encounter me. \n \n \n ","50":"\n And Herodotus, in his second book, relates that Myce- rinus the Egyptian, having\n been told by the soothsayers that he was fated to live but a short time, used to\n light a great number of lamps when night arrived, and spend all his time in\n drinking and luxury, relaxing neither by day nor by night; and when he withdrew\n into the marshes and into the groves, or wherever he heard that there were\n meetings of young people to amuse themselves, he always got drunk. And Herodotus\n tells us that Amasis also, who was another of the Egyptian kings, was a very hard\n drinker indeed. And Hermeas the Methymn\u00e6an, in the third book of his History of\n Sicily, says that Nicoteles the Corinthian was a man greatly addicted to drinking.\n And Ph\u00e6nias the Eresian, in the book entitled, The Slaying of Tyrants out of\n Revenge, says that Scopas the son of Creon, and the grandson of the former Scopas,\n was throughout his whole life very fond of drinking; and that he used to return\n from banquets at which he had been present, sitting on a throne, and carried by\n four palanquin-bearers, and in that way he used to enter his house. And\n Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories, says that Antiochus the king was a\n man very fond of wine; and that he used to get drunk, and then go to sleep for a\n long time, and then, as evening came on, he would wake up, and drink again. And it\n was very seldom, says he, that he transacted the affairs of his kingdom when he\n was sober, but much more frequently when he was drunk; on which account there were\n two men about him who managed all the real business of the state as they pleased,\n namely Aristos and Themiso, Cyprians by birth, and brothers; and they were both on\n terms of the greatest intimacy with Antiochus. \n ","51":"\n And Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Epiphanes, was also a great drinker,\u2014the\n one, I mean, who had been a hostage among the Romans, whom Ptolemy Euergetes\n mentions in the third book of his Commentaries, and also in the fifth; saying that\n he turned to Indian revellings and drunkenness, and spent a vast quantity of money\n in those practices; and for the rest of the money which he had at hand, he spent\n a part of it in his daily revels, and the rest he would\n scatter about, standing in the public streets, and saying, Let whoever\n chance gives it to, take it: and then, throwing the money about, he\n would depart. And very often, having a plaited garland of roses on his head, and\n wearing a golden embroidered robe, he would walk about alone, having stones under\n his arm, which he would throw at those of his friends who were following him. And\n he used to bathe also in the public baths, anointed all over with perfumes; and,\n on one occasion, some private individual, seeing him, said, You are a happy\n man, O king; you smell in a most costly manner: and he, being much\n pleased, said, I will give you as much as you can desire of this\n perfume. And so he ordered an ewer containing more than two choes of\n thick perfumed unguent to be poured over his head; so that the multitude of the\n poorer people who were about all collected to gather up what was spilt; and, as\n the place was made very slippery by it, Antiochus himself slipped and fell,\n laughing a great deal, and most of the bathers did the same. \n But Polybius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories, calls this man Epimanes\n (mad), and not Epiphanes (illustrious), on account of his actions. For he\n not only used to go to entertainments of the common citizens, but he also would\n drink with any strangers who happened to be sojourning in the city, and even\n with those of the meanest class. And if, says Polybius, he heard\n that any of the younger men were making a feast anywhere whatever, he would\n come with an earthen bowl, and with music, so that the greater part of the\n feasters fled away alarmed at his unexpected appearance. And very often he\n would put off his royal robes, and take a common cloak, and in that dress go\n round the market. \n \n ","52":"\n And in the thirty-first book of his Histories, the same Polybius tells us\n that when Antiochus was celebrating some public games at Antioch, he\n invited all the Greeks and any of the multitude who chose to come to the\n spectacle. And when a great many people came, he anointed them all in the\n gymnasia with ointment of saffron, and cinnamon, and nard, and amaracus, and\n lilies, out of golden vessels: and then, inviting them all to a feast, he\n filled sometimes a thousand and sometimes fifteen hundred triclinia with the\n most expensive preparations; and he himself personally\n attended to waiting on the guests. For, standing at the entrance, he introduced\n some, and others he placed upon the couches; and he himself marshalled the\n servants who brought in the different courses; and, walking about among the\n guests, at times he sat down in one place, and at times he lay down in another.\n And sometimes he would put down what he was eating, and at other times he would\n lay down his cup, and jump up, and change his place, and go all round the\n party, standing up himself, and pledging different people at different times;\n and then, mingling with the musicians, he would be brought in by the actors,\n entirely covered up, and laid down on the ground, as if he had been one of the\n actors himself; and then, when the music gave the signal, the king would leap\n up, and dance and sport among the actors, so that they were all ashamed. To\n such absurdities does a want of education, when joined with drunkenness, reduce\n miserable men. And his namesake, the Antiochus who carried on war in\n Media against Arsaces, was very fond of drinking; as Posidonius of Apamea relates\n in the sixteenth book of his History. Accordingly, when he was slain, he says that\n Arsaces, when he buried him, said\u2014Your courage and your drunkenness have ruined\n you, O Antiochus; for you hoped that, in your great cups, you would be able to\n drink up the kingdom of Arsaces.\" \n ","53":"\n But the Antiochus who was surnamed the Great, who was subdued by the Romans (as\n Polybius relates in his twentieth book), having arrived at Chalcis, in Euboea,\n celebrated a marriage when he was fifty years of age; and after he had undertaken\n two most enormous and important affairs, namely, the liberation of the Greeks (as\n he himself professed) and the war against the Romans. At all events, he, being\n smitten with love for a damsel of Chalcis, was very anxious to marry her at the\n very time that he was engaged in this war, being a man very fond of drinking and\n delighting in drunkenness. And she was the daughter of Cleophanes, one of the\n nobles, and superior to all the maidens of her country in beauty. Accordingly, he\n celebrated his marriage in Chalcis, and remained there all the winter, not once\n giving the smallest thought to the important affairs which he had in hand. And he\n gave the damsel the name of Eub\u0153a. Accordingly, being defeated in the war, he fled to Ephesus, with his newly-married bride. And in the second\n book, the same Polybius relates that Agron, the king of the Illyrians, being\n delighted at having gained a victory over the haughty Aetolians, being a man much\n addicted to drinking, and to drunkenness, and banqueting, fell ill of a pleurisy,\n and died. And the same historian says, in his twenty-ninth book, that Genthion,\n the king of the Illyrians, on account of his great fondness for drinking, did a\n great many intemperate things during his life, being incessantly drunk, both night\n and day; and having murdered Pleuratus, his brother, who was about to marry the\n daughter of Menunius, he married the damsel himself, and treated his subjects with\n great cruelty. And he says, in the thirty-third book of his History, that\n Demetrius, when he fled after having been a hostage at Rome, and became king of\n the Syrians, became a great drinker, and was drunk the greater part of the day.\n And he also, in his thirty-second book, says that Orophernes, who was for a short\n time king of Cappadocia, disregarded all the customs of his country, and\n introduced the artificial luxury of the Ionians. \n ","54":"\n On which account, that divinest of writers, Plato, lays down admirable laws in his\n second book\u2014 That boys, till they are eighteen years of age, should\n absolutely never taste wine at all; for that it is not well to heap fire on\n fire: that men up to thirty years of age may drink wine in moderation; and that\n the young man should wholly abstain from much wine and from drunkenness. But\n that a man, when he arrives at forty years of age, may feast in large banquets,\n and invoke the other gods, and especially Bacchus, to the feasts and amusements\n of the older men; since he it is who has given men this means of indulgence, as\n an ally against the austerity of old age, for which wine was the best medicine;\n so that, owing to it, we grow young again, and forget our moroseness. \n And then he proceeds to say\u2014 But there is a report and story told that this\n god was once deprived of his mind and senses by his mother-in-law, Juno; on\n which account he sent Bacchic frenzy, and all sorts of frantic rage, among men,\n out of revenge for the treatment which he had experienced; on which account\n also he gave wine to men. \n \n ","55":"\n But Phal\u00e6cus, in his Epigrams, makes mention of a woman, whose name was Cleo, as\n having been a very hard drinker\u2014 \n \n Cleo bestow'd this splendid gift on Bacchus, \n The tunic, fringed with gold and saffron hues, \n Which long she wore herself; so great she was \n At feasts and revelry: there was no man \n Who could at all contend with her in drinking. \n And it is a well-known fact that all the race of women is fond of\n drinking. And it was not without some wit that Xenarchus introduces, in his\n Pentathlum, a woman swearing this most horrible oath:\u2014 \n May it be granted me to pass from life \n Drinking abundant draughts of wine, while you, \n My darling daughter, live and prosper here. \n But among the Romans, as Polybius says, in his sixth book, it was\n forbidden to women to drink wine at all. However, they drink what is called\n Passum; and that is made of raisins, and when drank is very like the sweet\n Aegosthenite and Cretan wine, on which account men use it when oppressed by\n excessive thirst. And it is impossible for a woman to drink wine without being\n detected: for, first of all, she has not the key of the cellar; and, in the next\n place, she is bound to kiss her relations, and those of her husband, down to\n cousins, and to do this every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she\n is forced to be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may\n chance to meet; for if she has merely tasted wine, it needs no informer, but is\n sure to betray itself.\" \n And Alcimus the Sicilian, in that book of his which is entitled the Italian\n History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine on this account:\n When Hercules was in the district of the Crotoniat\u00e6, he one day was very\n thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside and asked for something to\n drink; and it happened that the wife of the master of the house had privily\n opened a cask of wine, and therefore she said to her husband that it would be a\n shameful thing for him to open this cask for a stranger; and so she bade him\n give Hercules some water. But Hercules, who was standing at the door, and heard\n all this, praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself\n and look at the cask. And when he had gone in, he found that the cask had\n become petrified. And this fact is proved by the conduct of the women of the\n country, among whom it is reckoned disgraceful, to this day, to drink wine, on\n account of the above-mentioned reason. \n \n \n ","56":"\n And what sort of women those among the Greeks are who get drunk, Antiphanes tells\n us, in his Female Darter; where he says\u2014 \n There is a certain neighbouring victualler, \n And he, whenever I arrive, being thirsty, \n Is th' only man who knows the proper way \n In which to mix my wine; and makes it not \n Too full of water, nor too strong and heady: \n I recollect that once when I was drinking . . . . \n And, in his Woman Initiated, (and it is women who are conversing,) he\n writes\u2014 \n \n A. Would you now like, my dearest friend, to\n drink? \n \n B. No doubt I should. \n \n A. Well come, then, take a cup; \n For they do say the first three cups one takes \n All tend to th' honour of the heavenly gods. \n And Alexis, in his Female Dancer, says\u2014 \n \n A. But women are quite sure to be content \n If they have only wine enough to drink. \n \n B.

I like this aged sphinx; \n For hear how now she talks to me in riddles. \n And so on. And, in his Jupiter the Mourner, he mentions a certain woman\n named Zopyra, and says\u2014 \n Zopyra, that wine-cask. \n Antiphanes, in his Female Bacchanalians\u2014 But since this now is not the\n case, I'm sure He is a wretched man who ever marries Except among the Scythians;\n for their country Is the sole land which does not bear the vine. And Xenarchus, in\n his Pentathlum, says\u2014 \n I write a woman's oath in mighty wine. \n \n \n ","57":"\n Plato, in his Phaon, relating how many things happen to women because of wine,\n says\u2014 \n Come now, ye women, long ago have I \n Pray'd that this wine may thus become your folly; \n For you don't think, as the old proverb goes, \n That there is any wisdom at a vintner's. \n For if you now desire to see Phaon, \n You first must all these solemn rites perform. \n First, as the nurse of youths, I must receive \n A vigorous cheesecake, and a pregnant mealcake, \n And sixteen thrushes whole, well smear'd with honey, \n \n Twelve hares, all taken when the moon was full; \n But all the other things may be got cheaply. \n Now listen.

Now if you bring \n These things, you'll certainly obtain admittance; \n But if you don't, you'll knock in vain, and long \n In vain to enter, and get nothing by it. \n And Axionicus says, in his Philinna\u2014 \n Just trust a woman to drink only water. \n \n \n ","58":"\n And whole nations are mentioned as addicted to drunkenness. Accordingly, B\u00e6ton,\n the measurer of distances for Alexander, in his book which is entitled Stations of\n the March of Alexander, and Amyntas also, in his Stations, says that the nation of\n the Tapyri is so fond of wine that they never use any other unguent than that. And\n Ctesias tells the same story, in his book Concerning the Revenues in Asia. And he\n says that they are a most just people. And Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise\n on the Laws in force among the people of Phigalea, says that the Phigaleans are\n addicted to drinking, being neighbours of the Messenians, and being also a people\n much accustomed to travelling. And Phylarchus, in his sixth book, says that the\n Byzantians are so exceedingly fond of wine, that they live in the wine-shops and\n let out their own houses and their wives also to strangers: and that they cannot\n bear to hear the sound of a trumpet even in their sleep. On which account once,\n when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not endure the labour of defending\n their walls, Leonidas, their general, ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected\n as tents upon the walls, and even then it was with difficulty that they were\n stopped from deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But Menander,\n in his play called the Woman carrying the Mysterious sacred Vessels of Minerva, or\n the Female Flute-player, says\u2014 \n Byzantium makes all the merchants drunk. \n On your account we drank the whole night long, \n And right strong wine too, as it seems to me,\u2014 \n At least I got up with four heads, I think. \n \n And the Argives too are ridiculed by the comic poets as\n addicted to drunkenness; and so are the Tirynthians by Ephippus, in his Busiris.\n And he introduces Hercules as saying\u2014 \n \n A. For how in the name of all the gods at once, \n Do you not know me, the Tirynthian Argive? \n That race fights all its battles when 'tis drunk. \n \n B. And that is why they always run away. \n And Eubulus, in his Man Glued, says that the Milesians are very insolent\n when they are drunk. And Polemo, in his treatise on the Inscriptions to be found\n in Cities, speaking of the Eleans, produces this epigram:\u2014 \n Elis is always drunk, and always lying: \n As is each single house, so is the city. \n \n \n ","59":"\n And Theopompus, in his twenty-second book, speaking of the Chalcidians in Thrace,\n says: \"For they disregarded all the most excellent habits, rushing readily with\n great eagerness to drinking and laziness, and every sort of intemperance. And all\n the Thracians are addicted to drinking; on which account Callimachus says\u2014 \n For he could hardly bear the Thracian way \n Of drinking monstrous goblets at one draught; \n And always did prefer a smaller cup.\" \n And, in his fiftieth book, Theopompus makes this statement about the\n Methymn\u00e6ans: And they live on the more sumptuous kind of food, lying down\n and drinking\u2014and never doing anything at all worthy of the expense that they\n went to. So Cleomenes the tyrant stopped all this; he who also ordered the\n female pimps, who were accustomed to seduce free-born women, and also three or\n four of the most nobly born of those who had been induced to prostitute\n themselves, to be sewn in sacks and thrown into the sea. And Hermippus,\n in his account of the Seven Wise Men, says Periander did the same thing. But in\n the second book of his History of the Exploits of Philip he says, The\n Illyrians both eat and drink in a sitting posture; and they take their wives to\n their entertainments; and it is reckoned a decorous custom for the women to\n pledge the guests who are present. And they lead home their husbands from their\n drinking parties; and they all live plainly, and when they drink, they girdle\n their s stomach with broad girdles, and at first they do so moderately; but\n when they drink more vehemently, then they keep contracting their belt. And the Ari\u00e6ans, says he, have three hundred\n thousand slaves whom they call prospelat\u00e6, and who correspond to the Helots;\n and they get drunk every day, and make large entertainments, and are very\n intemperate in their eating and drinking. On which account the Celt\u00e6 when\n making war upon them, knowing their intemperance, ordered all the soldiers to\n prepare as superb a feast as possible in the tent, and to put in the food some\n medicinal herbs which had the power to gripe and purge the bowels exceedingly.\n And when this had been done . . . .And so some of them were taken by the Celt\u00e6\n and put to death, and some threw themselves into the rivers, being unable to\n endure the pains which they were suffering in their stomachs. \n \n ","60":"\n Now, after Democritus had uttered all this long uninterrupted discourse, Pontianus\n said that wine was the metropolis of all these evils; and it was owing to this\n that drunkenness, and madness, and all sorts of debauchery took place; and that\n those people who were too much addicted to it were not unappropriately called\n rowers of cups, by that Dionysius who is surnamed the Brazen, in his Elegies,\n where he says\u2014 \n And those who bring their wine in Bacchus' rowing, \n Sailors through feasts, and rowers of large cups. \n And concerning this class of men, (for it is not extinct,) Alexis, in his\n Curia, speaking of some one who drunk to excess, says\u2014 \n This then my son is such in disposition \n As you have just beheld him. An \u0152nopion, \n Or Maron, or Capelus, or Timoclees, \n For he's a drunkard, nothing more nor less. \n And for the other, what can I call him? \n A lump of earth, a plough, an earth-born man. \n So getting drunk is a bad thing, my good friends; and the same Alexis\n says, with great cleverness, to those who swallow wine in this way, in his Opora,\n (and the play is called after a courtesan of that name,)\u2014 \n Are you then full of such a quantity \n Of unmix'd wine, and yet avoid to vomit? \n And in his Ring he says\u2014 \n Is not, then, drunkenness the greatest evil, \n And most injurious to the human race? \n \n And in his Steward he says\u2014 \n For much wine is the cause of many crimes. \n And Crobylus, in his Female Deserter, says\u2014 \n What pleasure, prithee tell me, can there be \n In getting always drunk? in, while still living, \n Yourself depriving thus of all your senses; \n The greatest good which nature e'er has given? \n Therefore it is not right to get drunk; for A city which has been\n governed by a democracy, says Plato, in the eighth book of his Polity,\n when it has thirsted for freedom, if it meets with bad cupbearers to\n help it, and if, drinking of the desired draught too deeply, it becomes\n intoxicated, then punishes its magistrates if they are not very gentle indeed,\n and if they do not allow it a great deal of licence, blaming them as wicked and\n oligarchical; and those people who obey the magistrates it insults. \n And, in the sixth book of his Laws, he says\u2014 A city ought to be like a\n well-mixed goblet, in which the wine which is poured in rages; but being\n restrained by the opposite and sober deity, enters into a good partnership with\n it, and so produces a good and moderate drink. \n \n ","61":"\n For profligate debauchery is engendered by drunkenness. On which account\n Antiphanes, in his Arcadia, says\u2014 \n For it, O father, never can become \n A sober man to seek debauchery, \n Nor yet to serious cares to give his mind, \n When it is rather time to drink and feast. \n But he that cherishes superhuman thoughts, \n Trusting to small and miserable riches, \n Shall at some future time himself discover \n That he is only like his fellow-men, \n If he looks, like a doctor, at the tokens, \n And sees which way his veins go, up or down, \n On which the life of mortal man depends. \n And, in his Aeolus, mentioning with indignation the evil deeds which\n those who are great drinkers do, he says\u2014 \n Macareus, when smitten with unholy love \n For one of his own sisters, for a while \n Repress'd the evil thought, and check'd himself; \n But after some short time he wine admitted \n To be his general, under whose sole lead \n Audacity takes the place of prudent counsel, \n And so by night his purpose he accomplish'd. \n \n And well, therefore, did Aristophanes term wine the milk of\n Venus, saying\u2014 \n And wine, the milk of Venus, sweet to drink; \n because men, after having drunk too much of it, have often conceived a\n desire for illicit amours. \n ","62":"\n But Hegesander the Delphian speaks of some men as \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9; by which term he means, overtaken with wine; speaking\n thus:\u2014 Comeon and Rhodophon being two of the ministers who managed the\n affairs of Rhodes, were both drunk; and Comeon attacking Rhodophon as a\n gambler, said\u2014 \n O you old man, the crew of youthful gamblers \n Beyond a doubt are pressing hard upon you. \n And Rhodophon reproached him with his passion for women, and with his\n incontinence, abstaining from no sort of abuse. And Theopompus, in the\n sixteenth book of his Histories, speaking of another Rhodian, says\u2014 When\n Hegesilochus had become perfectly useless, partly from drunkenness and\n gambling, and when he had utterly lost all credit among the Rhodians, and when\n instead his whole course of life was found fault with by his own companions and\n by the rest of the citizens. . . . .Then he goes on to speak of the\n oligarchy which he established with his friends, saying\u2014 And they violated a\n great number of nobly-born women, wives of the first men in the state; and they\n corrupted no small number of boys and young men; and they carried their\n profligacy to such a height that they even ventured to play with one another at\n dice for the free-born women, and they made a bargain which of the nobly-born\n matrons he who threw the lowest number on the dice should bring to the winner\n for the purpose of being ravished; allowing no exception at all; but the loser\n was bound to bring her to the place appointed, in whatever way he could, using\n persuasion, or even force if that was necessary. And some of the other Rhodians\n also played at dice in this fashion; but the most frequent and open of all the\n players in this way was Hegesilochus, who aspired to become the governor of the\n city. \n \n And Antheas the Lindian, who claimed to be considered a relation of Cleobulus the\n philosopher, as Philodemus reports, in his treatise on the Sminthians in Rhodes,\n being an oldish man, and very rich, and being also an accomplished poet, celebrated the festivals in honour of Bacchus all his life,\n wearing a dress such as is worn by the votaries of Bacchus, and maintaining a\n troop of fellow-revellers. An he was constantly leading revels both day and night;\n and he was the first man who invented that. kind of poetry which depends upon\n compound words, which Asopodorus the Phliasian afterwards employed in his\n conversational Iambics. And he too used to write comedies and many other pieces in\n the same style of poetry, which he used to recite to his phallus-bearers. \n ","63":"\n When Ulpian had heard all this he said,\u2014Tell me, my good Pontianus, says he, in\n what author does the word \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 occur? And he\n replied\u2014 \n You will undo me with your questions.. \n (as the excellent Agatho says)\u2014 \n . . . . and your new fashion, \n Always talking at an unseasonable time. \n But since it is decided that we are to be responsible to you for every\n word, Antiphanes, in his Lydian, has said\u2014 \n A Colchian man drunken and quarrelsome ( \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n But you are not yet satisfied about your \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, and drunkards; nor do you consider that Eumenes the king\n of Pergamus, the nephew of Philet\u00e6rus, who had formerly been king of Pergamus,\n died of drunkenness, as Ctesicles relates, in the third book of his Times. But,\n however, Perseus, whose power was put down by the Romans, did not die in that way;\n for he did not imitate his father Philip in anything; for he was not eager about\n women, nor was he fond of wine; but when at a feast he was not only moderate\n himself, but all his friends who were with him were so too, as Polybius relates,\n in his twenty-sixth book. But you, O Ulpian, are a most immoderate drinker\n yourself ( \u1f00\u1fe4\u1fe5\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ), as Timon te Phliasian\n calls it.

For a fellow-drinker of his once, seeing his\n wife at a banquet, said, Anacharsis, you have married an ugly\n woman.

For he says, But\n there is a peculiarity in the effects of the drink made from barley, which they\n call \u03c0\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, for they who get drunk on other\n intoxicating liquors fall on all parts of their body; they fall on the left\n side, on the right side, on their faces, and on their backs. But it is only\n those who get drunk on beer who fall on their backs, and lie with their faces\n upwards. But the wine which is made of barley is by some called\n \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, as Sophocles says, in his Triptolemus\u2014\n \n And not to drink the earthy beer ( \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Archilochus says\u2014 \n And she did vomit wine as any Thracian \n Might vomit beer ( \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ), and played the\n wanton stooping. \n And Aeschylus, also, mentions this drink, in his Lycurgus\u2014 \n And after this he drank his beer ( \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ),\n and much \n And loudly bragg'd in that most valiant house. \n But Hellanicus, in his Origins, says that beer is made also out of roots,\n and he writes thus:\u2014 But they drink beer ( \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ) made of roots, as the Thracians drink it made of\n barley. And Hecat\u00e6us, in the second book of his Description of the\n World, speaking of the Egyptians, and saying that they are great bread-eaters,\n adds, They bruise barley so as to make a drink of it. And, in his\n Voyage round Europe, he says that the P\u00e6onians drink beer made of barley,\n and a liquor called \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b7, made of millet and\n conyza. And they anoint themselves, adds he, with oil made of\n milk. And this is enough to say on these topics. \n ","67":"\n \n \n But in our time dear to the thyrsus-bearers \n Is rosy wine, and greatest of all gods \n Is Bacchus. \n As Ion the Chian says, in his Elegies\u2014 \n For this is pretext fit for many a song; \n The great assemblies of th' united Greeks, \n The feasts of kings, do from this gift proceed, \n Since first the vine, with hoary bunches laden, \n Push'd from beneath the ground its fertile shoots, \n Clasping the poplar in its firm embrace, \n And from its buds burst forth a numerous race, \n \n \n \n Crashing, as one upon the other press'd; \n But when the noise has ceased they yield their juice, \n Divinest nectar, which to mortal men \n Is ever the sole remedy for care, \n And common cause of joy and cheerfulness. \n Parent of feasts, and laughter, and the dance, \n Wine shows the disposition of the good, \n And strengthens all their noble qualities. \n Hail! then, O Bacchus, president of feasts, \n Dear to all men who love the wreathed flowers; \n Give us, kind God, an age of happiness, \n To drink, and play, and cherish just designs. \n \n \n But Amphis, in his Philadelphi, praising the life of those who are fond of\n drinking, says:\u2014 \n For many causes do I think our life, \n The life of those who drink, a happy one; \n And happier far than yours, whose wisdom all \n Lies in a stern and solemn-looking brow. \n For that slow prudence which is always busy \n In settling small affairs, which with minuteness, \n And vain solicitude, keeps hunting trifles, \n Fears boldly to advance in things of weight; \n But our mind, not too fond of scrutinising \n Th' exact result of every trifling measure, \n Is ever for prompt deeds of spirit ready. \n \n \n ","68":"\n And when Ulpian was about to add something to this Aemilianus said,\u2014It is time for\n us, my friends, to inquire in some degree about \u03b3\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9, that we may leave our cups for a little while, not indeed in\n the spirit of that work which is entitled the Grammatical Tragedy of Callias the\n Athenian: but let us first inquire what is the definition of what we call a\n \u03b3\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2. . . . And we may omit what Cleobulina\n of Lindus has proposed in her Epigrams; for our companion, Diotimus of Olympia,\n has discussed that point sufficiently; but we must consider how the comic poets\n have mentioned it, and what punishment those who have failed to solve it have\n undergone. And Laurentius said,\u2014Clearchus the Solensian defines the word thus: \n \u03b3\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, \n says he, is a sportive problem, in which we are bidden to seek\n out, by the exertion of our intellect and powers of investigation, what i\n proposed to us, which has been uttered for the sake of some honour or some\n penalty. And in his discussion on these griphi, the same Clearchus\n asserts that there are seven kinds of griphi. In the letter, when we say\n that there is a certain name of a fish or plant, beginning with a. And\n similarly, when he who proposes the griphus desires us to\n mention some name in which some particular letter is or is not. Such are those\n which are called sigma-less griphi; on which account Pindar has composed an ode\n on the \u03c2, as if some griphus had been proposed\n to him as a subject for a lyric poem. Then griphi are said to be in the\n syllable, when we are desired to recite some verse which begins with the\n syllable \u03b2\u03b1, as with \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2, for instance, or which ends with \u03bd\u03b1\u03be, as \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03be, or some in\n which the syllables \u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd take the lead, as\n \u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, or on the other hand close the\n sentence, as \u03b8\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03dd. They are in the name,\n when we utter simple or compound names of two syllables, by which some tragic\n figure, or on the other hand some humble one, is indicated; or some names which\n have no connexion with anything divine, as \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, or which have some such connexion, as \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 : and this, too, whether the connexion be\n with one God or with more, as \u02bd\u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; or\n whether the name begins with Jupiter, as \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2, or with Mercury, as \u02bd\u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2; or whether it ends, as it perhaps may, with \u03bd\u1fd6\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2. And then they who were desired to say such and\n such things, and could not, had to drain the cup. And Clearchus defined\n the word in this way. And now you, my good friend Ulpian, may inquire what the cup\n to be drained is. \n ","69":"\n But concerning these griphi, Antiphanes says, in his Cn\u0153this, or the Pot-bellied\n Man\u2014 \n \n A. I thought before that those who while at\n meals \n Bade me solve griphi, were the silliest triflers, \n Talking mere nonsense. And when any one \n Was bade to say what a man bore and bore not, \n I laugh'd and thought it utter childishness; \n And did not think that truth did lie beneath, \n But reckon'd them as traps for the unwary. \n But now, indeed, I see there is some truth in them; \n For we, ten men, contribute now for supper, \n But no one of them all bears what he brings, \n So here's a case where he who bears bears not, \n And this is just the meaning of a griphus. \n So surely this may fairly be excused; \n But others play tricks with the things themselves, \n Paying no money, as, for instance, Philip. \n \n B. A wise and fortunate man, by Jove, is he. \n And in his Aphrodisian he says\u2014 \n \n A.

Prithee say \n A cheesecake. \n \n A. Shall I speak of rosy sweat \n From Bacchic spring? \n \n B. I'd rather you'd say wine. \n \n A. Or shall I speak of dusky dewy drops? \n \n B.

No, call it myrrh,\u2014forbear \n Those sad long-winded sentences, those long \n And roundabout periphrases; it seems \n To me by far too great a labour thus \n To dwell on matters which are small themselves, \n And only great in such immense descriptions. \n \n \n ","70":"\n And Alexis, in his Sleep, proposes a griphus of this kind\u2014 \n \n A.

And that when some one had proposed to them this riddle,\n What is the strongest of all things? one said iron, and alleged\n the following reasons for her opinion, because that is the instrument with which\n men dig and cut, and that is the material which they use for all purposes. And\n when she had been applauded, the second damsel said that a blacksmith exerted much\n greater strength, for that he, when he was at work, bent this strong iron, and\n softened it, and used it for whatever purposes he chose. And the third said, they\n were both wrong, and that love was the strongest thing of all, for that love could\n subdue a blacksmith. \n And Ach\u00e6us the Eretrian, though he is usually a very clear poet as respects the\n structure of his poems, sometimes makes his language obscure, and says many things\n in an enigmatical style; as, for instance, in his Iris, which is a satyric play.\n For he says, A cruet of litharge full of ointment was suspended from a\n Spartan tablet, written upon and twisted on a double stick; meaning to\n say a white strap, from which a silver cruet was suspended; and he has spoken of a\n Spartan written tablet when he merely meant the Spartan scytale. And that the\n Laced\u00e6monians put a white strap, on which they wrote whatever they wished, around\n the scytale, we are told plainly enough by Apollonius Rhodius, in his Treatise on\n Archilochus. And Stesichorus, in his Helen, speaks of a footpan of litharge; and\n Ion, in his Ph\u0153nix or C\u00e6neus, calls the birdlime the sweat of the oak, saying\u2014\n \n The sweat of oaks, and a long leafy branch \n Cut from a bush supports me, and a thread \n Drawn from Egyptian linen, clever snare \n To catch the flying birds. \n \n \n ","74":"\n And Hermippus says, that Theodectes of Phaselus, in his book\n on the Pupils of Isocrates, was a wonderfully clever man at discovering any\n riddles that might be proposed to him, and that he too could propose riddles to\n others with great acuteness. As that riddle about shade, for instance;\u2014 for he\n said that there was a nature which is greatest at its birth and at its decease,\n and least when at its height. And he speaks thus:\u2014 \n Of all the things the genial earth produces, \n Or the deep sea, there is no single one, \n Nor any man or other animal \n Whose growth at all can correspond to this: \n For when it first is born its size is greatest; \n At middle age 'tis scarcely visible, \n So small it's grown; but when 'tis old and hastens \n Nigh to its end, it then becomes again \n Greater than all the objects that surround it. \n And in the \u0152dipus, which is a tragedy, he speaks of night and day in the\n following riddle:\u2014 \n There are two sisters, one of whom brings forth \n The other, and in turn becomes its daughter. \n \n \n And Callisthenes, in his Greek History, tells the following story, that\n when the Arcadians were besieging Cromnus, (and that is a small town\n near Megalopolis,) Hippodamus the Laced\u00e6monian, being one of the besieged\n persons, gave a message to the herald who came to them from the Laced\u00e6monians,\n showing the condition in which they were by a riddle, and he bade him tell his\n mother-'to be sure and release within the next ten days the little woman who\n was bound in the temple of Apollo; as it would not be possible to release her\n if they let those days elapse.' And by this message he plainly enough intimated\n what he was desirous to have understood; for the little woman meant is Famine,\n of which there was a picture in the temple of Apollo, near the throne of\n Apollo, and it was represented under a woman's form; so it was evident to every\n one that those who were besieged could hold out only ten days more because of\n famine. So the Laced\u00e6monians, understanding the meaning of that had been said,\n brought succour with great speed to the men in Cromnus. \n \n ","75":"\n There are also many other riddles, such as this:\u2014 \n I saw a man who by the means of fire \n Was glueing brass unto another man \n So closely that they two became like brothers. \n \n And this expression means the application of a cupping-\n glass. And a similar one is that of Panarces, mentioned by Clearchus, in his Essay\n on Griphi, that A man who is not a man, with a stone which was not a stone,\n struck a bird which was not a bird, sitting on a tree which was not a\n tree. For the things alluded to here are a eunuch, a piece of\n pumice-stone, a bat, and a narthex . And Plato, in the fifth book of his Laws, alludes to this riddle, where he\n says, that those philosophers who occupy themselves about minute arts, are like\n those who, at banquets, doubt what to eat, and resemble too the boys' riddle about\n the stone thrown by the eunuch, and about the bat, and about the place from which\n they say that the eunuch struck down the bat, and the engine with which he did\n it. \n ","76":"\n And of this sort also are those enigmatical sayings of Pythagoras, as Demetrius of\n Byzantium says, in the fourth book of his treatise on Poets, where, for instance,\n he says, A man should not eat his heart; meaning, a man\n should cultivate cheerfulness. \n One should not stir the fire with a sword; meaning, One\n should not provoke an angry man; for anger is fire, and quarrelsomeness\n is a sword. One should not step over a yoke meaning, one\n should avoid and hate all kinds of covetousness, but seek equality. \n One should not travel along the high road; meaning, One should not\n follow the opinions of the multitude, (for the common people approve of whatever\n they take in their heads without any fixed principle,) but one should rather go on\n the straight road, using sense as one's guide.\" One should not sit down\n upon a bushel; meaning, one should not be content with merely\n considering what is sufficient for the present day, but one should always have\n an eye to the future * * * * * * \n For death is the boundary and limit of life; and this saying is\n meant to forbid us approaching the subject with anxiety and grief. \n ","77":"\n And Dromeas the Coan used to play at riddles in much the same\n way as Theodectes, according to the state- ment of Clearchus: and so did\n Aristonymus, the player on the harp, without any vocal accompaniment: and so did\n that Cleon who was surnamed Mimaulus, who was the best actor of Italian mimes that\n ever appeared on the stage without a mask. For in the style of play which I have\n mentioned already, he was superior even to Nymphodors. And Ischomachus the herald\n was an imitator of his, who used to give his representations in the middle of a\n crowd, and after he had become celebrated, he altered his style and used to act\n mimes at the jugglers shows. And the riddles which these men used to propose were of\n the following kind:\u2014A clown once had eaten too much, and was very unwell, and when\n the physician asked him whether he had eaten to vomit, No, said he, but I ate to\n my stomach. And another was,\u2014 A poor woman had a pain in her stomach, and when the\n physician asked her whether she had anything in her stomach, How should I, said\n she, when I have eaten nothing for three days? \n And the writings of Aristonymus were full of pompous ex- pressions: and Sosiphanes\n the poet said to Cephisocles the actor, reproaching him as a man fond of long\n words, I would throw a stone at your loins, if I were not afraid of wetting\n the bystanders. But the logical griphus is the oldest kind, and the one\n most suited to the natural character of such enigmatical language. What do\n we all teach when We do not know it ourselves and, What is the\n same nowhere and everywhere? and also, What is the same in the\n heavens and on the earth and in the sea? But this is a riddle arising\n from an identity of name; for there is a bear, and a serpent, and an eagle, and a\n dog, both in the heavens and on the earth and in the sea. And the other riddle\n means Time; for that is the same to all people and everywhere, because it has not\n its nature depending on one place. And the first riddle means How to\n live: for though no one knows this himself he teaches his\n neighbour. \n ","78":"\n And Callias the Athenian, whom we were discussing just now, and who was a little\n before Strattis in point of time, wrote a play which he called Grammatical\n Science; and the plot of it was as follows. The prologue consists of the elements, and the actor should recite it, dividing it into\n para- graphs, and making the termination in the manner of a dramatic catastrophe,\n into Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, theta. For \u03b5\u03b9 is sacred to the God; iota, cappa, lambda, mu, nu, xu, the\n diphthong ou, pi, rho, sigma, tau, the present u, phi, chi, which is next to\n psi, all down to omega. And the chorus consisted of women, in pairs,\n made of two elements taken together, composed in metre and lyrical odes in this\n fashion \u2014 Beta alpha ba, beta ei be, beta eta be, beta iota bi, beta ou bo,\n beta upsilon bu, beta omega bo. And then, again, in the antistrophe of\n the ode and of the metre, Gamma alpha, gamma ei, gamma eta, gamma iota,\n gamma omicron, gamma upsilon, gamma omega. And in the same way he dealt\n with all other syllables\u2014all which have the same melody and the same metre in the\n antistrophes. So that people not only suspect that Euripides drew all his Medea\n from this drama, but they think that it is perfectly plain that he drew the system\n of his choruses from it. And they say that Sophocles, after he had heard this\n drama, endeavoured to divide his poem in respect of the metre, and did it thus, in\n the \u0152dipus,\u2014 \n I shall not grieve myself nor you, \n Being convicted of this action. \n On which account, all the rest admitted the system of antistrophes from\n his example, as it should seem, into their tragedies. Then, after this chorus,\n Callias introduces another speech of vowels, in this manner: (and this also the\n reciter must divide into paragraphs in the same way as the previous portions, in\n order that that delivery may be preserved which the author originally intended)\u2014\n \n Alpha alone, O woman; then one should \n Say \u03b5\u03b9 alone in the second place: next, \n Still by itself you will say, thirdly, Eta; \n Fourth, still alone, Iota; fifthly, Ou. \n In the sixth place, Upsilon by itself. \n The last of all the seven vowels is \n The slow-paced Omega. The seven vowels \n In seven verses; and when you've recited \n All these, then go and ponder by yourself. \n \n \n ","79":"\n Callias was also the first man who taught the elements of learning by iambics, in\n a licentious sort of language, described in the following manner\u2014 \n \n For I'm in labour, ladies; but from shame, \n I will, my dear, in separate lines and letters, \n Tell you the name of the child. There is a line \n Upright and long; and from the middle of it \n There juts forth on each side a little one, \n With upward look: and next a circle comes, \n On two short feet supported. \n And afterwards, following this example, as any one may suspect, M\u00e6andrius\n the prose writer, turning away a little from the usual pronunciation in his\n descriptions, wrote those things which are found in his Precepts, in a less\n polished style than the above-mentioned Callias. And Euripides appears to have\n followed the same model when he composed those verses, in his Theseus, in which\n the elements of writing are described. But the character is an illiterate\n shepherd, who is showing that the name of Theseus is inscribed in the place in\n this way\u2014 \n For I indeed do nothing know of letters, \n But I will tell you all their shapes, and give \n Clear indications by which you may judge. \n There is a circle, round as though 't had been \n Work'd in a lathe, and in its centre space \n It has a visible sign. Then the second \n Has first of all two lines, and these are parted \n By one which cuts them both across the middle. \n The third's a curly figure, wreathed round. \n The fourth contains one line which mounts right up, \n And in a transverse course three others hang \n From its right side. The letter which cones fifth \n Admits of no such easy explanation; \n For there are two diverging lines above, \n Which meet in one united line below. \n The letter which comes last is like the third. \n [So as to make \u03b8 \u03b7 \u03c2 \u03b5 \u03c5 \u03c2. ] \n And Agathon the tragic poet has composed a similar passage, in his Telephus; for\n there also some illiterate man explains the way of spelling Theseus thus:\u2014 \n The letter which comes first is like a circle, \n Divided by a navel in the middle; \n Then come two upright lines well-join'd together; \n The third is something like a Scythian bow: \n Next comes a trident placed upon its side; \n And two lines branching from one lower stem: \n The last again the same is as the third. \n And Theodectes of Phaselus introduces an illiterate clown, who also\n represents the name of Theseus in his own way\u2014 \n \n The letter which comes first a circle is, \n With one soft eye; then come two upright lines \n Of equal and exact proportions, \n United by one middle transverse line; \n The third is like a wreathed curl of hair; \n The next a trident lying on its side; \n The fifth two lines of equal length above, \n Which below join together in one base; \n The sixth, as I have said before, a curl. \n And Sophocles has said something like this, in his Amphiaraus, which is a\n satyric drama, where he introduces an actor dancing in unison with his explanation\n of the letters. \n ","80":"\n But Neoptolemus the Parian, in his treatise on Inscriptions, says that this\n inscription is engraved on the tomb of Thrasymachus the sophist at Chalcedon\u2014\n \n My name is Theta, ro, alpha, and san, \n Upsilon, mu, alpha, chi, ou, san again: \n Chalcedon was my home, wisdom my trade. \n And there is a poem of this kind upon Pan, by Castorion the Solensian, as\n Clearchus says: every foot consists of one entire word,\n and so every line has its feet in pairs, so that they may either precede or follow\n each other; as for instance\u2014 \n \n \u03c3\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \n \n \n \u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd\u03b8\u02bc \u1f15\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u1f70\u03bd, \u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u02bc \u02bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd, \n \n \n \u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1fc7 \u03c4\u1fc7\u03b4\u02bc \u1f10\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u1fc7, \u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u02bc \u1f14\u03c0\u03b7 \n \n \n \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2, \u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be, \u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \n \n \n \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5 \u03b8\u1f74\u03c1, \u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f45\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u02bc \u1f31\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2. \n \n [Which may be translated thus\u2014 \n O thou that dwellest on the lofty plain, \n Stormy with deep loud-sounding falls of snow, \n Th' Arcadian land,\u2014lord of the forest kinds, \n Thee, mighty Pan, will I invoke in this \n Sagacious writing, carefully compounding \n Words difficult for ignorant men to know, \n Or rightly understand.

And others say that a dolphin and a goat were embossed in that part of a\n psaltery where the strings are put in, and that they are what is meant here; and\n that the bull-slaying servant of Bacchus is the dithyrambic. And others say that\n the ox which is sacrificed to Bacchus in the town of Iulis is struck with an axe\n by some one of the young men: and that the festival being near, the axe had been\n sent to a forge, and Simonides, being then a young man, went to the smith to fetch\n it; and that when he found the man asleep, and his bellows and his tongs lying\n loosely about with their fore parts touching one another, he then came back, and\n told the before-mentioned problem to his friends. For the father of a kid he\n called the bellows, and the sad fish the tongs (which is called \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, or the crab). The son of Night is sleep, and\n the bull-slaying servant of Bacchus is the axe. And Simonides composed also\n another epigram which causes perplexity to those who are ignorant of history\u2014\n \n I say that he who does not like to win \n The grasshopper's prize, will give a mighty feast \n To the Panopeiadean Epeus. \n And it is said, that when he was sojourning at Carthea he used to train\n choruses; and that the place where these exercises took place was in the upper\n part of the city, near the temple of Apollo, a long way from the sea; so that all\n the rest of the citizens, and Simonides himself, went down to get water, to a\n place where there was a fountain; an that an ass, whose name was Epeus, used to\n carry the water up for them; and they gave him this name, because there was a\n fable that Epeus himself used to do this; and there was also represented in a\n picture, in the temple of Apollo, th Trojan fable, in which Epeus is represented\n as drawing water for the Atrid\u00e6; as Stesichorus also relates\u2014 \n For the great daughter of Jove pitied him \n Bearing incessant water for the kings. \n \n And as this was the case, they say that it was a burden\n imposed on every member of the choruses who was not present at the appointed time,\n that he should give the ass a ch\u0153nix of barley; and that this is stated by the\n same poet; and that what is meant by not liking to win the grasshopper's prize, is\n not liking to sing; and that by Panopeiadean is meant the ass, and the mighty\n feast is the ch\u0153nix of barley. \n ","84":"\n And of the same kind is the epigram of Theognis the poet,\u2014 \n For a sea-corpse has call'd me now back home, \n Which, though dead, speaketh with a living mouth. \n Where he means the cockle.

And there is also that riddle which is so frequently repeated\u2014\n \n Five men came to one place in vessels ten, \n And fought with stones, but might not lift a stone, \n And died of thirst while water reach'd their chins. \n \n \n ","85":"\n And what punishment had the Athenians who could not solve this riddle when\n proposed to them, if it was only to drink a bowl of mixed wine, as Clearchus has\n stated in his Definition? And, in the first book of his treatise on Proverbs, he\n writes thus\u2014 The investigation of riddles is not unconnected with\n philosophy; for the ancients used to make a display of their erudition by such\n things; for they used at their entertainments to ask questions, not such as the\n men of the present day ask one another, as to what sort of amorous enjoyment is\n the most delicious, or what kind of fish is nicest, or what is most in season\n at the moment; or again, what fish is best to eat at the time of Arcturus, or\n what after the rising of the Pleiades, or of the Dogstar. And then they offer\n kisses as prizes for those who gain the victory in such questions; such as are\n hateful to men of liberal sentiments; and as a punishment for those who are\n defeated they enjoin them to drink sheer wine; which they drink more willingly\n than the cup of health. For these things are well adapted to any one who has\n devoted his attention to the writings of Phil\u00e6nis and Archestratus, or who has\n studied the books called Gastro- logies. They preferred\n such plays as these;\u2014when the first person had recited a verse, the others were\n bound to quote the verse following; or if any one had quoted a sentence from\n some poet, the rest were bound to produce a sentence from some other poet\n expressing the same sentiments. After that, every one was bound to repeat an\n iambic. And then, each person was to repeat a line of such and such a number of\n syllables precisely; and so on with everything that related to any acquaintance\n with letters and syllables. And in a similar manner they would be bound to\n repeat the names of all the commanders in the army which attacked Troy, or of\n all the Trojan leaders: or to tell the name of some city in Asia beginning with\n a given letter; and then the next person was to tell the name of a city in\n Europe: and then they were to go through the rest according as they were\n desired to give the names of Grecian or barbarian cities; so that this sport,\n not being an inconsiderate one, was a sort of exhibition of the ability and\n learning of each individual. And the prizes given were a garland and applause,\n things by which love for one another is especially sweetened. \n \n ","86":"\n This, then, was what Clearchus said; and the things which he says one ought to\n propose, are, I imagine, such as these.

They drank brine mingled with their drink, and were bound to\n drink the whole cup up at one draught; as Antiphanes shows in his Ganymede, where\n he says\u2014 \n \n \n A. Alas me! what perplexing things you say, \n O master, and what numerous things you ask me. \n \n B. But now I will speak plainly: if you know \n One circumstance about the rape of the child, \n You must reveal it quick, before you're hang'd. \n \n A. Are you then asking me a riddle, master, \n Bidding me tell you all about the rape \n Of the child? What's the meaning of your words? \n \n B. Here, some one, bring me out a halter\n quickly. \n \n A. What for? \n \n B. Perhaps you'll say you do not know. \n \n A. Will you then punish me with that? Oh don't! \n You'd better make me drink a cup of brine. \n \n B. Know you then how you ought to drink that up? \n \n A. Indeed I do. \n \n B. How? \n \n A. So as to make you pledge me. \n \n B. No, but first put your hands behind your\n back, \n Then drink it at a draught, not drawing breath. \n So when the Deipnosophists had said all this about the griphi, since it\n has taken us till evening to recollect all they said, we will put off the\n discussion about cups till to-morrow. For as Metagenes says in his Philothytes\u2014\n \n I'll change my speech, by way of episode, \n So as to treat the theatre with many \n New dishes rich with various seasonings; \n taking the discussion about cups next. \n "},"10":{"0":"\n \n \n Come now, where shall our conversation rise? \n as Cephisodorus the comic poet says, my good friend Timocrates; for when\n we were all met together at a convenient season, and with serious minds, to\n discuss the goblets, Ulpian, while every one was sitting still, and before any one\n began to speak at all, said,\u2014At the court of Adrastus, my friends, the chief men\n of the nation sup while sitting down. But Polyidus, while sacrificing on the road,\n detained Peteos as he was passing by, and while lying on the grass, strewing some\n leaves which he had broken off on the ground by way of a table, set before him\n some part of the victim which he had sacrificed. And when Autolycus had come to\n the rich people of Ithaca, and while he was sitting down,\n (for the men of that time ate their meals while sitting down,) the nurse took\n Ulysses, (as the poet says\u2014 \n His course to Ithaca the hero sped \n When first the product of Laertes' bed \n Was new disclosed to birth; the banquet ends \n When Euryclea from the queen descends, \n And to his fond embrace the babe commends:) \n and placed him on his knees, not near his knees. So let us not waste time\n now, but let us lie down, that Plutarch may lead the way in the lecture which he\n promised us on the subject of goblets, and that he may pledge us all in\n bumpers. \n ","1":"\n But I imagine that Simonides of Amorgus is the first poet who has spoken of\n drinking cups ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ) by name in his iambics,\n thus\u2014 \n The cups away did lead him from the table. \n And the author of the poem called the Alcm\u00e6onis says\u2014 \n He placed the corpses lowly on the shore \n On a broad couch of leaves; and by their side \n A dainty feast he spread, and brimming cups, \n And garlands on their noble temples wreathed. \n And the word \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd comes from \u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, drink, as the Attic word \u1f14\u03ba\u03c0\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 also does; but they form the word with \u03c9, as they also say \u1f51\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9, to\n drink water, and \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9, to drink wine.\n Aristophanes, in his Knights, says\u2014 \n A stupid serpent drinking deep of blood ( \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n But he also says in the same play\u2014 \n Much then did Bacis use the cup ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Pherecrates, in his Tyranny, says\u2014 \n One is better than a thousand cups ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ). \n And Anacreon said\u2014 \n I am become a wine-bibber ( \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n And the verb occurs also in the same poet, for he says \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd.

But Cham\u00e6leon of Heraclea, in his essay on Drunkenness, (if I only\n recollect his words correctly,) says\u2014 But if those who are in power and who\n are rich prefer this drunkenness to other pleasures, it is no great wonder, for\n as they have no other pleasure superior to this, nor more easy to obtain, they\n naturally fly to wine: on which account it has become customary among the\n nobles to use large drinking-cups. For this is not at all an ancient custom\n among the Greeks; but one that has been lately adopted, and imported from the\n barbarians. For they, being destitute of education, rush eagerly to much wine,\n and provide themselves with all kinds of superfluous delicacies. But in the\n various countries of Greece, we neither find in pictures nor in poems any trace\n of any cups of large size being made, except indeed in the heroic times. For\n the cup which is called \u1fe5\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd they attributed only to the heroes, which fact will appear a\n per- plexing one to some people; unless indeed any one should choose to say\n that this custom was introduced because of the fierceness of the appearance of\n these demigods. For they think the heroes irascible and quarrelsome, and more\n so by night than by day. In order, then, that they may appear to be so, not in\n consequence of their natural disposition, but because of their propensity for\n drinking, they represent them as drinking out of large cups. And it appears to\n me not to have been a bad idea on the part of those people who said that a\n large cup was a silver well. \n \n In all this Cham\u00e6leon appears to be ignorant that it is not a small cup which in\n Homer is given to the Cyclops by Ulysses; for if it had been a small one, he would\n not have been so overcome with drunkenness after drinking it three times only,\n when he was a man of such a monstrous size. There were therefore large cups at\n that time; unless any one chooses to impute it to the strength of the wine, which\n Homer himself has mentioned, or to the little practice which the Cyclops had in\n drinking, since his usual beverage was milk; or perhaps it was a barbaric cup,\n since it was a big one, forming perhaps a part of the plunder of the Cicones. What\n then are we to say about Nestor's cup, which a young man would scarcely have had\n strength enough to carry, but which the aged Nestor lifted without any labour;\n concerning which identical cup Plutarch shall give us some information. However,\n it is time now to lie down at table. \n ","4":"\n And when they had all laid themselves down;-But, said Plutarch, according to the\n Phliasian poet Pratinas\u2014 \n Not ploughing ready-furrow'd ground, \n But, seeking for a goblet, \n I come to speak about the cups ( \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd ). \n Nor indeed am I one of those \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \n whom Hermippus, the comic poet, ridicules in his iambics, where he says\u2014 \n I've come now to the vineyard of the Cylicranes, \n And seen Heraclea, a beauteous city. \n But these are Heracleans who live at the foot of Mount \u0152ta, as Nicander\n of Thyatira says; saying that they are so named from a certain Cylix, a Lydian by\n birth, who was one of the comrades of Hercules. And they are mentioned also by\n Scythinus the Teian, in his work entitled The History, where\n he says, Hercules, having taking Eurytus and his son, put them to death for\n exacting tribute from the people of Eub\u0153a. And he laid waste the territory of\n the Cylicranes for behaving like robbers; and there he built a city called\n Heraclea of Trachis. And Polemo, in the first of his books, addressed\n to Ad\u00e6us and Antigonus, speaks thus\u2014 But the inhabitants of the Heraclea\n which is at the foot of Mount \u0152ta, and of Trachis, are partly some Cylicranes\n who came with Hercules from Lydia, and partly Athamanes, some of whose towns\n remain to this day. And the people of Heraclea did not admit them to any of the\n privileges of citizenship, considering them only as foreigners sojourning\n amongst them; and they were called Cylicranes, because they had the figure of a\n cup ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) branded on their shoulders. \n \n ","5":"\n I am aware, too, that Hellanicus says, in his treatise on the Names of Races, that\n Some of the Libyan nomades have no other possessions than a cup, and a\n sword, and a ewer, and they have small houses made of the stalks of asphodel,\n merely just to serve as a shade, and they even carry them about with them\n wherever they go. There is also a spot amongst the Illyrians, which has\n been celebrated by many people, which is called \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, near to which is the tomb of Cadmus and Harmonia, as\n Phylarchus relates in the twenty-second book of his Histories. And Polemo, in his\n book on Morychus, says that at Syracuse, on the highest spot of the part called\n the Island, there is an alter near the temple of Olympia, outside the walls, from\n which he says that people when putting to sea carry a goblet with them, keeping it\n until they get to such a distance that the shield in the temple of Minerva cannot\n be seen; and then they let it fall into the sea, being an earthenware cup, putting\n into it flowers and honeycombs, and uncut frankincense, and all sorts of other\n spices besides. \n ","6":"\n And since I now see your banquet, as Xeophanes the Colophonian says, full of all\n kinds of pleasure\u2014 \n For now the floor and all men's hands are clean, \n And all the cups, and since the feasters' brows \n Are wreathed with garlands, while the slaves around \n Bring fragrant perfume in well-suited dishes; \n And in the middle stands the joyful bowl. \n And wine's at hand, which ne'er deserts the guests \n Who know its worth, in earthen jars well kept, \n Well flavour'd, fragrant with the sweet fresh flowers; \n \n And in the midst the frankincense sends forth \n Its holy perfume; and the water's cold, \n And sweet, and pure; and golden bread's at hand, \n And duly honour'd tables, groaning under \n Their weight of cheese and honey;\u2014then an altar, \n Placed in the centre, all with flow'rs is crown'd. \n And song and feasting occupies the house, \n And dancing, and all sorts of revelry:\u2014 \n Therefore it does become right-minded men \n First with well-omen'd words and pious prayers \n To hymn the praises of the Gods; and so, \n With pure libations and well-order'd vows, \n To win from them the power to act with justice- \n For this comes from the favour of the Gods; \n And you may drink as much as shall not hinder \n You from returning home without assistance, \n Unless, indeed, you're very old: and he \n Deserves to be above his fellows lauded \n Who drinks and then says good and witty things, \n Such as his memory and taste suggests,\u2014 \n Who lays down rules, and tells fine tales of virtue; \n Not raking up the old Titanic fables, \n Wars of the Giants, or the Lapith\u00e6, \n Figments of ancient times, mere pleasing trifles, \n Full of no solid good; but always speaking \n Things that may lead to right ideas of God. \n \n \n ","7":"\n And the exquisite Anacreon says\u2014 \n I do not love the man who, 'midst his cups, \n Says nothing but old tales of war and strife, \n But him who gives its honour due to mirth, \n Praising the Muses and the bright-faced Venus. \n And Ion of Chios says\u2014 \n Hail, our great king, our saviour, and our father! \n And let the cupbearers now mix us wine \n In silver jugs: and let the golden bowl \n Pour forth its pure libations on the ground, \n While duly honouring the mighty Jove. \n First of the Gods, and first in all our hearts, \n We pour libations to Alcmena's son, \n And to the queen herself,\u2014to Procles too, \n And the invincible chiefs of Perseus' line. \n Thus let us drink and sport; and let the song \n Make the night cheerful; let the glad guests dance; \n And do thou willingly preside among us: \n But let the man who's a fair wife at home \n Drink far more lustily than those less happy. \n \n \n Those also who were called the seven wise men used to make drinking parties;\n for wine comforts the natural moroseness of old age, as\n Theophrastus says, in his treatise on Drunkenness. \n \n ","8":"\n On which account, when we are met together in these Dionysiac conversaziones, no\n one, as is said in the Tarentines of Alexis\u2014 \n No one can find a just pretence to grudge us \n Our harmless pleasure, since we never injure \n One of our neighbours. Know you not, my friend, \n That what is called life is but a name, \n Well soften'd down (to make it palatable), \n For human fate? And whether any one \n Thinks that I'm right or wrong in what I say, \n I cannot change a word; for well I know, \n And long have I consider'd the whole matter, \n That all th' affairs of men are full of madness, \n And we who live are only sojourners, \n Like men who go to some great festival, \n Starting from death and darkness to a pastime, \n And to this light which we behold before us. \n But he who laughs and drinks most cheerfully, \n And most enjoys the charming gifts of Venus, \n And most attends on feasts and festivals, \n He goes through life, and then departs most happily. \n And, in the words of the beautiful Sappho,\u2014 \n Come, O Venus, hither come, \n Bringing us thy goblets fair, \n Mingled with the merry feast; \n And pour out sparkling wine, I pray, \n To your and my companions gay. \n \n \n ","9":"\n And we may add to all this, that different cities have peculiar fashions of\n drinking and pledging one another; as Critias mentions, in his Constitution of the\n Laced\u00e6monians, where he says\u2014 The Chian and the Thasian drink out of large\n cups, passing them on towards the right hand; and the Athenian also passes the\n wine round towards the right, but drinks out of small cups. But the Thessalian\n uses large cups, pledging whoever he pleases, without reference to where he may\n be; but among the Laced\u00e6monians, ever one drinks out of his own cup, and a\n slave, acting as cupbearer, fills up again the cup when each has drained\n it. Andnaxandrides also mentions the fashion of passing the cup round\n towards the right hand, in his Countrymen, speaking as follows:\u2014 \n \n A. In what way are you now prepared to drink? \n Tell me, I pray. \n \n B. In what way are we now \n Prepared to drink? Why any way you please. \n \n A. Shall we then now, my father, tell the guests \n \n To push the wine to the right \n \n B. What! to the right? \n That would be just as though this were a funeral. \n \n \n \n ","10":"\n But we may decline entering on the subject of goblets of earthenware; for Ctesias\n says\u2013 Among the Persians, that man only uses an earthenware who is\n dishonoured by the king. And Ch\u0153rilus the epic poet says\u2014 \n Here in my hands I hold a wretched piece \n Of earthen goblet, broken all around, \n Sad relic of a band of merry feasters; \n And often the fierce gale of wanton Bacchus \n Dashes such wrecks with insult on the shore. \n But I am well aware that earthenware cups are often very pleasant, as\n those which are imported among us from Coptus; for they are made of earth which is\n mixed up with spices. And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness,\n says\u2014 The cups which are called Rhodiacan are brought into drinking\n parties, because of the pleasure which they afford, and also because, when they\n are warmed, they deprive the wine of some of its intoxicating properties; for\n they are filled with myrrh and rushes, and other things of the same sort, put\n into water and then boiled; and when this mixture is put into the wine, the\n drinkers are less apt to become intoxicated. And in another place he\n says\u2014 The Rhodiacan cups consist of myrrh, flowery rushes, saffron,\n balsam, spikenard, and cinnamon, all boiled together; and when some of this\n compound is added to the wine, it has such effect in preventing intoxication,\n that it even diminishes the amorous propensities, checking the breath in some\n degree. \n \n ","11":"\n We ought not, then, to drink madly, looking at the multitude of these beautiful\n cups, made as they are with every sort of various art, in various countries.\n But the common people, says Chrysippus, in the introduction to\n his treatise on what is Good and Evil, \"apply the term madly to a great number of\n things; and so they call a desire for women \n \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, a fondness for quails \u1f40\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1; and some also call those who are very\n anxious for fame \u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2; just as they call\n those who are fond of women \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2, and\n those who are fond of birds \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 : all\n these nouns having the same notion of a propensity to the degree of madness. So\n that there is nothing inconsistent in other feelings and circumstances having this\n name applied to them; as a person who is very fond of delicacies, and who is\n properly called \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c8\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, may be called \u1f40\u03c8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2; \n and a man very fond of wine maybe called \u03bf\u1f30\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2; and so in similar instances. And there is nothing\n unreasonable in attributing madness to such people, since they carry their errors\n to a very mad pitch, and wander a great distance from the real truth. \n ","12":"\n Let us, then, as was the custom among the Athenians, drink our wine while\n listening to these jesters and buffoons, and to other artists of the same kind.\n And Philochorus speaks of this kind of people in these terms\u2014 The Athenians,\n in the festivals of Bacchus, originally used to go to the spectacle after they\n had dined and drunk their wine; and they used to witness the games with\n garlands on their heads. But during the whole time that the games were going\n on, wine was continually being offered to them, and sweetmeats were constantly\n being brought round; and when the choruses entered, they were offered wine; and\n also when the exhibition was over, and they were departing, wine was offered to\n them again. And Pherecrates the comic poet bears witness to all these things,\n and to the fact that down to his own time the spectators were never left\n without refreshment. And Phanodemus says\u2014\"At the temple of Bacchus,\n which is in the Marshes ( \u1f10\u03bd \u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 ), the\n Athenians bring wine, and mix it out of the cask for the god, and then drink of it\n themselves; on which account Bacchus is also called \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, because the wine was first drunk at that festival mixed\n with water. On which account the fountains were called Nymphs and te Nurses of\n Bacchus, because the water being mingled with the wine increases the quantity of\n the wine. \n Accordingly, men being delighted with this mixture, celebrated Bacchus in their\n songs, dancing and invoking him under the names of Euanthes, and Dithyrambus, and\n Baccheutes, and Bromius.\" And Theophrastus, in hi treatise on Drunkenness,\n says\u2014 The nymphs are really the nurses of Bacchus;\n for the vines, when cut, pour forth a great deal of moisture, and after their\n own nature weep. On which account Euripides says that one of the Horses\n of the Sun is \n Aethops, who with his fervent heat doth ripen \n Th' autumnal vines of sweetly flow'ring Bacchus, \n From which men also call wine Aethops ( \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\n \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Ulysses gave \n Twelve large vessels of unmix'd red wine, \n Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine, \n Which now (some ages from his race conceal'd) \n The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd. \n Such was the wine, to quench whose fervent steam \n Scarce twenty measures from the living stream \n To cool one cup sufficed; the goblet crown'd, \n Breathed aromatic fragrancies around. \n \n And Timotheus, in his Cyclops, says\u2014 \n He fill'd one cup, of well-turn'd iv'ry made, \n With dark ambrosial drops of foaming wine; \n And twenty measures of the sober stream \n He poured in, and with the blood of Bacchus \n Mingled fresh tears, shed by the weeping nymphs. \n \n \n ","13":"\n And I know, my messmates, of some men who were proud, not so much of their wealth\n in money as of the possession of many cups of silver and gold; one of whom is\n Pytheas the Arcadian, of the town of Phigalea, who, even when dying, did not\n hesitate to enjoin his servants to inscribe the following verses on his tomb:\u2014\n \n This is the tomb of Pytheas, a man \n Both wise and good, the fortunate possessor \n Of a most countless number of fine cups, \n Of silver made, and gold, and brilliant amber. \n These were his treasures, and of them he had \n A store, surpassing all who lived before him. \n And Harmodius the Lepreatian mentions this fact in his treatise on the\n Laws and Customs subsisting in Phigalea. And Xenophon, in the eighth book of his\n Cyrop\u00e6dia, speaking of the Persians, writes as follows\u2014 And also they pride\n themselves exceedingly on the possession of as many goblets as possible; and\n even if they have acquired them by notorious malpractices, they are not at all\n ashamed of so doing; for injustice and covetousness are carried on to a great\n degree among them. But \u0152dipus cursed his sons on account of some\n drinking-cups (as the author of the Cyclic poem called the\n Thebais says), because they set before him a goblet which he had forbidden;\n speaking as follows:\u2014 \n But the divine, the golden-hair'd hero, \n Great Polynices, set before his father first \n A silver table, beautifully wrought, \n Whilome the property of th' immortal Cadmus; \n And then he fill'd a beauteous golden cup \n Up to the brim with sweet and fragrant wine; \n But \u0152dipus, when with angry eyes he saw \n The ornaments belonging to his sire \n Now set before him, felt a mighty rage, \n Which glow'd within his breast, and straightway pour'd \n The bitterest curses forth on both his sons, \n (Nor were they by the Fury all unheard,) \n Praying that they might never share in peace \n The treasures of their father, but for ever \n With one another strive in arms and war. \n \n \n ","14":"\n And C\u00e6cilius the orator who came from Cale Acte, in his treatise on History, says\n that Agathocles the Great, when displaying his golden drinking-cups to his\n companions, said that he had got all these from the earthenware cups which he had\n previously made. And in Sophocles, in the Lariss\u00e6ans, Acrisius had a great many\n drinking-cups; where the tragedian speaks as follows:\u2014 \n And he proclaims to strangers from all quarters \n A mighty contest, promising among them \n Goblets well wrought in brass, and beauteous vases \n Inlaid with gold, and silver drinking-cups, \n Full twice threescore in number, fair to see. \n And Posidonius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories, says that\n Lysimachus the Babylonian, having invited Himerus to a banquet (who was tyrant not\n only over the people of Babylon, but also over the citizens of Seleucia), with\n three hundred of his companions, after the tables were removed, gave every one of\n the three hundred a silver cup, weighing four mince; and when he had made a\n libation, e pledged them all at once, and gave them the cups to carry away with\n them. And Anticlides the Athenian, in the sixteenth book of his Returns, speaking\n of Gra, who, with other kings, first led a colony into the island of Lesbos, and\n saying that those colonists had received an answer from the oracle, bidding them,\n while sailing, throw a virgin into the sea, as an offering to Neptune, proceeds as\n follows:\u2014 And some people, who treat of the history and affairs of\n Methymna, relate a fable about the virgin who was thrown\n into the sea; and say that one of the leaders was in love with her, whose name\n was Enalus, and that he dived down, wishing to save the damsel; and that then\n both of them, being hidden by the waves, disappeared. But that in the course of\n time, when Methymna had now become populous, Enalus appeared again, and related\n what had happened, and how it had happened; and said that the damsel was still\n abiding among the Nereids, and that he himself had become the superintendent of\n Neptune's horses; but that a great wave having been cast on the shore, he had\n swam with it, and so come to land: and he had in his hand a goblet made of\n gold, of such wondrous workmanship that the golden goblets which they had, when\n compared with his, looked no better than brass. \n \n ","15":"\n And in former times the possession of drinking-cups was reckoned a very honourable\n thing. Accordingly, Achilles had a very superb cup as a sort of heirloom:\u2014 \n But, mindful of the gods, Achilles went \n To the rich coffer in his shady tent, \n (There lay the presents of the royal dame;) \n From thence he took a bowl of antique frame, \n Which never man had stain'd with ruddy wine, \n Nor raised in offerings to the pow'rs divine, \n But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none \n Had raised in offerings but to Jove alone. \n \n And Priam, when offering ransom for his son, amid all his most beautiful\n treasures especially offers a very exquisitely wrought cup. And Jupiter himself,\n on the occasion of the birth of Hercules, thinks a drinking-cup a gift worthy to\n be given to Alcmena; which he, having likened himself to Amphitryon, presents to\n her:\u2014 \n And she received the gift, and on the bowl \n Admiring gazed with much delighted soul. \n And Stesichorus says that the sun sails over the whole ocean in a bowl;\n in which also Hercules passed over the sea, on the occasion of his going to fetch\n the cows of Geryon. We are acquainted, too, with the cup of Bathycles the\n Arcadian, which Bathycles left behind him as a prize of wisdom to him who should\n be pronounced the best of those who were called the wise men. \n And a great many people have handled the cup of Nestor; for\n many have written books about it. And drinking-cups were favourites even among the\n Gods; at all events\u2014 \n They pledged each other in their golden cups. \n \n But it is a mark of a gentleman to be moderate in his use of wine, not\n drinking too greedily, nor drinking large draughts without drawing one's breath,\n after the fashion of the Thra- cians; but to mingle conversation with his cups, as\n a sort of wholesome medicine. \n ","16":"\n And the ancients affixed a great value to such goblets as had any story engraved\n upon them; and in the art of engraving cups in this manner, a high reputation was\n enjoyed by Cimon and Athenocles. They used also drinking-cups inlaid with precious\n stones. And Menander, somewhere or other, speaks of drinking-cups turned by the\n turning-lathe, and chased; and Antiphanes says\u2014 \n And others drain with eager lips the cup, \n Full of the juice of ancient wine, o'ershadow'd \n With sparkling foam,\u2014the golden-wrought rich cup, \n Which circled round they raised: one long, deep draught \n They drain, and raise the bottom to the skies. \n And Nicomachus says to some one\u2014 \n O you, who . . . . . and vomit golden . . . \n And Philippides says\u2014 \n Could you but see the well-prepared cups, \n All made of gold, my Trophimus; by heaven, \n They are magnificent! I stood amazed \n When I beheld them first. Then there were also \n Large silver cups, and jugs larger than I. \n And Parmenio, in his letter to Alexander, summing up the spoils of the\n Persians, says, The weight of goblets of gold is seventy-three Babylonian\n talents, and fifty-two mit\u00e6. The\n weight of goblets inlaid with precious stones, is fifty-six Babylonian talents,\n and thirty-four min\u00e6. \n \n ","17":"\n And the custom was, to put the water into the cup first, and the wine afterwards.\n Accordingly, Xenophanes says\u2014 \n \n And never let a man a goblet take, \n And first pour in the wine; but let the water \n Come first, and after that, then add the wine. \n And Anacreon says\u2014 \n Bring me water -bring me wine, \n Quick, O boy; and bring, besides, \n Garlands, rich with varied flowers; \n And fill the cup, that I may not \n Engage in hopeless strife with love. \n And before either of them Hesiod had said\u2014 \n Pour in three measures of the limpid stream, \n Pure from an everflowing spring; and then \n Add a fourth cup of sacred rosy wine. \n And Theophrastus says\u2014 The ancient fashion of the mixture of wine\n was quite opposite to the way in which it is managed at the present day; for\n they were not accustomed to pour the water on the wine, but the wine on the\n water, in order, when drinking, not to have their liquor too strong, and in\n order also, when they had drunk to satiety, to have less desire for more. And\n they also consumed a good deal of this liquor, mixed as it was, in the game of\n the cottabus. \n \n ","18":"\n Now of carvers of goblets the following men had a high reputation,\u2014Athenocles,\n Crates, Stratonicus, Myrmecides the Milesian, Callicrates the Laced\u00e6monian, and\n Mys; by which last artist we have seen a Heraclean cup, having most beautifully\n wrought on it the capture of Troy, and bearing also this inscription\u2014 \n The sketch was by Parrhasius,\u2014by Mys \n The workmanship; and now I represent \n The lofty Troy, which great Achilles took. \n \n \n ","19":"\n Now among the Cretans, the epithet \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2, \n illustrious, is often given to the objects of one's affection. And it is a matter\n of great desire among them to carry off beautiful boys; and among them it is\n considered discreditable to a beautiful boy not to have a lover.

There is also the expression \u1f00\u03c0\u02bc\n \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, which means, from the right hand. And the cup is called\n \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7, from the fact that the right hand is\n curved, in throwing the cottabus from it. For it was a matter to which great\n attention was paid by the ancients\u2014namely, that of throwing the cottabus\n dexterously and gracefully. And men in general prided themselves more on their\n dexterity in this than in throwing the javelin skilfully. And this got its name\n from the manner in which the hand was brandished in throwing the cottabus, when\n they threw it elegantly and dexterously into the cottabium. And they also built\n rooms especially designed for this sport. \n ","22":"\n In Timachides there is also a kind of drinking-cup mentioned, called the\n \u00e6acis. \n \n There is another kind also, called the \u1f04\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or\n boat, being shaped like a boat. Epicrates says\u2014 \n Throw down th' acatia, \n (using here the diminutive form,) \n and take instead \n The larger goblets; and the old woman lead \n Straight to the cup; . . . the younger maiden . . . . \n . . . . . . . fill it; have your oar \n All ready, loose the cables, bend the sails. \n Among the Cyprians there is also a kind of cup called the aotus, as\n Pamphilus tells us: and Philetas says, this is a cup which has no ears ( \u1f64\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ). \n There is also a kind of cup called aroclum, which is mentioned by Nicander the\n Colophonian. \n ","23":"\n The cup called \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd, is the same as that called\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2. Homer, in his Odyssey, speaking of\n Pisistratus, says\u2014 \n In a rich golden cup he pour'd the wine; \n \n and proceeding, he says, in the same manner\u2014 \n To each a portion of the feast he bore, \n And held the golden goblet ( \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd ) foaming\n o'er; \n and presently afterwards he says\u2014 \n And gave the goblet ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 ) to Ulysses'\n son. \n And, accordingly, Asclepiades the Myrlean says\u2014 The \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 appears to me to have been much of the same\n shape as the \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7. For men make libations with\n it. Accordingly, Homer says,\u2014 \n The cup which Peleus' son \n Had raised in offerings to Jove alone. \n And it is called \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2, either because\n it is given to all ( \u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9 ) who wish to\n make libations, or who wish to drink; or because it has two ears ( \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u1f66\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 ), for \u1f66\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 \n must be the same as \u1f66\u03c4\u03b1. And it has the name of\n \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd, either from being very smooth\n ( \u1f04\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd ), or because the liquor is\n collected ( \u1f01\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ) in it. And that it had two\n ears is plain\u2014 \n High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl \n By both its ears. \n But when he applies the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd to it, he means nothing more than \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd curved on both sides. But Silenus\n interprets the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd to mean devoid of\n ears, while others say that \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u1f76 here is\n equivalent to \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76, and that it means a cup which\n you may put to your mouth all round, at any part of it. But Parthenius says that\n it means that the ears are curved ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ), for that is synonymous with \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2. But Anicetus says that the \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd is a kind of cup ( \u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7 ),\n and that the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd is equivalent to\n \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, that is to say, superb and\n magnificent; unless, indeed, any one chooses to interpret the word \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd as something very highly ornamented, and\n therefore not at all smooth ( \u03b1,\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd ). And\n Pisander says, Hercules gave Telamon a cup ( \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd ) as the prize of his preeminent valour in the expedition\n against Troy. \n ","24":"\n There is also a kind of cup called the horn of Amalthea, and another called\n \u1f10\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2, or the year. \n There is also a kind of cup made of wood, called \u1f04\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, which Philetas says that the countrymen use, who milk their\n cattle into it, and then drink the milk. \n There is also a kind of drinking called \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, \n when any one drinks a long draught without taking breath and without winking\n ( \u03bc\u1f74 \u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 ). And they give the same name to\n the goblets from which it is easy to drink in this manner. And they also use a\n verb ( \u1f10\u03ba\u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 ) for drinking without taking\n breath, as Plato the comic poet says\u2014 \n And opening a fair cask of fragrant wine, \n He pours it straight into the hollow cup; \n And then he drank it sheer and not disturb'd, \n And drain'd it at one draught ( \u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03bc\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 ). \n And they also drank the \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 draught\n to an accompaniment of music; the melody being measured out according to the\n quickness of the time; as Ameipsias says\u2014 \n Gentle musician, let that dulcet strain \n Proceed; and, while I drink this luscious draught, \n Play you a tune; then you shall drink yourself. \n For mortal man has no great wants on earth, \n Except to love and eat;-and you're too stingy. \n \n \n ","25":"\n There is also a kind of cup called Antigonis, from the name of king Antigonus:\n like the Seleucis from kin Seleucus; and the Prusis, from king Prusias. \n There is also a kind of cup known in Crete, and called anaph\u00e6a, which they use for\n hot drinks. \n There is also a kind of cup called aryballus. This kind of cup is wider at the\n bottom, and contracted at to like a purse when it is drawn together; and, indeed,\n some people call purses \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, from their\n resemblance to this kind of cup. Aristophanes says, in his Knights\u2014 \n \n He pour'd upon his head \n Ambrosia from a holy cup ( \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n And the aryballus is not very different from the arystichus, being\n derived from the verbs \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9 and \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9; they also call a jug \u1f04\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2. Sophocles says\u2014 \n You are most accursed of all women, \n Who come to supper with your \u1f00\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \n \n There is also a city of the Ionians called arystis. \n There is another kind of cup called argyris, which is not necessarily made of\n silver. Anaxilas says\u2014 \n And drinking out of golden argyrides. \n \n \n ","26":"\n Then batiacium, labronius, tragelaphus, pristis, are all names of different kinds\n of cups. The batiaca is a Persian goblet. And among the letters of the great\n Alexander to the Satraps of Asia there is inserted one letter in which the\n following passage occurs:\u2014 There are three batiac\u00e6 of silver gilt, and a\n hundred and seventy-six silver condya; and of these last thirty-three are gilt.\n There is also one silver tigisites, and thirty-two silver-gilt mystri. There is\n one silver vegetable dish, and one highly wrought wine-stand of silver\n ornamented in a barbaric style. There are other small cups from every country,\n and of every kind of fashion, to the number of twenty-nine: and other\n small-sized cups called rhyta, adbatia, and Lycurgi, all gilt, and\n incense-burners and spoons. \n \n There is a cup used by the Alexandrians named bessa, wider in the lower parts, and\n narrow above. \n ","27":"\n There is also a kind of cup called baucalis: and this, too, is chiefly used in\n Alexandria, as Sopater the parodist says\u2014 \n A baucalis, with four rings mark'd on it. \n And in another passage he says\u2014 \n 'Tis sweet for men to drink ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ) \n Cups of the juice by bees afforded, \n At early dawn, when parch'd by thirst, \n Caused by too much wine overnight. \n And the men in Alexandria, it is said, have a way of working crystal,\n forming it often into various shapes of goblets, and imitating in this material\n every sort of earthenware cup which is imported from any possible country. And\n they say that Lysippus the statuary, wishing to gratify Cassander, when he was\n founding the colony of Cassandria, and when he conceived the\n ambition of inventing some peculiar kind of utensil in earthenware, on account of\n the extraordinary quantity of Mendean wine which was exported from the city, took\n a great deal of pains with that study, and brought Cassander a great number of\n cups of every imaginable fashion, all made of earthenware, and taking a part of\n the pattern of each, thus made one goblet of a design of his own. \n ","28":"\n There is also a kind of cup called bicus. Xenophon, in the first book of his\n Anabasis, says:\u2014\"And Cyrus sent him a number of goblets ( \u03b2\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ) of wine half full; and it is a cup of a flat shallow shape,\n like a \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, according to the description given\n of it by Pollux the Parian. \n There is another kind of cup called the bombylius; a sort of Rhodian Thericlean\n cup; concerning the shape of which Socrates says,\u2014 Those who drink out of\n the phiale as much as they please will very soon give over; but those who drink\n out of a bombylius drink by small drops. There is also an animal of the\n same name. \n There is also a kind of drinking-cup called the bromias, in form like the larger\n kind of scyphus. \n ","29":"\n There is another kind called the lettered cup, having writing engraved round it.\n Alexis says\u2014 \n \n A. Shall I describe to you the appearance first \n O' the cup you speak of? Know, then, it was round; \n Exceeding small; old, sadly broken too \n About the ears; and all around the brim \n Were carved letters. \n \n B. Were there those nineteen \n Engraved in gold,\u2014To Jupiter the Saviour? \n \n \n A. Those, and no others. \n And we have seen a lettered cup of this kind lying at Capua in Campania,\n in the temple of Diana; covered with writing taken from the poems of Homer, and\n beautifully engraved; having the verses inlaid in golden characters, like the\n drinking-cup of Nestor. And Ach\u00e6us the tragic poet, in his Omphale, himself also\n represents the Satyrs speaking in the following manner about a lettered\n drinking-cup\u2014 \n And the god's cup long since has call'd me, \n Showing this writing,\u2014delta, then iota, \n The third letter was omega, then nu, \n \n Then u came next, and after that a sigma \n And omicron were not deficient. \n But in this passage we want the final v which ought to have ended the\n word. Since all the ancients used the omicron not only with the power which it has\n now, but also when they meant to indicate the diphthong \u03b5\u03b9 they wrote it by o only. And they did the same when they wished\n to write the vowel \u03b5, whether it is sounded by\n itself, or when they wish to indicate the diphthong \u03b5\u03b9 by the addition of iota. And accordingly, in the above-cited\n verses, the Satyrs wrote the final syllable of the genitive case \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03cd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 with \u03bf only; as\n being short to engrave: so that we are in these lines to understand the final\n upsilon, so as to make the whole word \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03cd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5. \n And the Dorians called sigma san; for the musicians, as Aristoxenus often tells\n us, used to avoid saying sigma whenever they could, because it was a hard-sounding\n letter, and unsuited to the flute; but they were fond of using the letter rho,\n because of the ease of pronouncing it. And the horses which have the letter\n \u03c2 branded on them, they call samphoras.\n Aristophanes, in his Clouds, says\u2014 \n Neither you, nor the carriage-horse, nor samphoras. \n And Pindar says\u2014 \n Before long series of songs were heard, \n And the ill-sounding san from out men's mouths. \n And Eubulus also, in his Neottis, speaks of a lettered cup as being\n called by that identical name, saying\u2014 \n \n A. Above all things I hate a letter'd cup, \n Since he, my son, the time he went away, \n Had such a cup with him. \n \n B. There are many like it. \n \n \n ","30":"\n There is a kind of cup also called gyala. Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says that\n the Megarians call their cups gyal\u00e6. And Parthenius, the pupil of Dionysius, in\n the first book of his Discussions upon Words found in the Historians,\n says\u2014 The gyala is a kind of drinking-cup, as Marsyas the priest of\n Hercules writes, where he says, 'Whenever the king comes into the city, a man\n meets him having a cup ( \u03b3\u03c5\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd ) full of wine;\n and the king takes it, and pours a libation from it.' \n \n ","31":"\n There is another sort of cup called the deinus. And that this is the name of a cup\n we are assured by Dionysius of Sinope, in his Female Saviour, where he gives a\n catalogue of the names of cups, and mentions this among them,\n speak- ing as follows\u2014 \n And as for all the kinds of drinking-cups, \n Lady, all fair to see,\u2014dicotyli, \n Tricotyli besides, the mighty deinus, \n Which holds an entire measure, and the cymbion \n The scyphus and the rhytum; on all these \n The old woman keeps her eyes, and minds nought else. \n And Cleanthes the philosopher, in his book on Interpretation, says, that\n the cups called the Thericlean, and that called the Deinias, are both named from\n the original makers of them. And Seleucus, saying that the deinus is a kind of\n cup, quotes some lines of Stratis, from his Medea\u2014 \n Dost know, O Creon, what the upper part \n Of your head doth resemble? I can tell you: \n 'Tis like a deinus turned upside down. \n And Archedicus, in his Man in Error, introducing a servant speaking of\n some courtesans, says\u2014 \n \n A. I lately introduced a hook-nosed woman, \n Her name Nicostrata; but surnamed also \n Scotodeina, since (at least that is the story) \n She stole a silver deinus in the dark. \n \n B. A terrible thing ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd ), by Jove; a terrible thing! \n \n \n The deinus is also the name of a kind of dance, as Apollophanes tells us in his\n Dalis, where he says\u2014 \n A strange thing ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd ) is this deinus and\n calathiscus. \n And Telesilla the Argive calls a threshing-floor also \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. And the Cyren\u00e6ans give the same name to a\n foot-tub, as Philetas tells us in his Attic Miscellanies. \n ","32":"\n There is also a kind of drinking-cup called \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. Silenus and Clitarchus, in their Dialects, say that this\n is a name given to drinking-cups among the Clitorians; but Antimachus the\n Colophonian, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says\u2014 And carefully they all\n commands obey'd Which wise Adrastus laid on them. They took A silver goblet, and\n they pour'd therein Water, and honey pure, compounding deftly; And quickly then\n they all distributed The cups ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c0\u03b1 ) among the\n princes of the Greeks, Who there were feasting; and from a golden jug They pour'd\n them wine for due libations. And in another place he says\u2014 \n Let others bring the bowl of solid silver, \n Or golden cups ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 ), which in my halls\n are stored. \n \n And immediately afterwards he says\u2014 \n And golden cups ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 ), and a pure\n untouch'd vessel \n Of honey sweet, which will be beat for him. \n \n \n ","33":"\n There is also a kind of cup called \u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, \n with finger-like handles; and it is called so by Ion, in the Agamemnon\u2014 \n And you shall have a gift worth running for, \n A finger handled cup, not touch'd by fire, \n The mighty prize once given by Pelias, \n And by swift Castor won. \n But by this expression Epigenes understands merely having two ears, into\n which a person could put his fingers on each side. Others, again, explain it as\n meaning, having figures like fingers engraved all round it; or having small\n projections like the Sidonian cups;\u2014or, again, some interpret the word as meaning\n merely smooth. But when he says, untouched by fire, that has the same meaning as\n Homer's phrase\u2014 \n \n \u1f04\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, \n \n meaning a caldron fit for the reception of cold water, or suitable for\n drinking cold drinks out of. But by this expression some understand a horn; and\n about the Molossian district the oxen are said to have enormous horns; and the way\n in which they are made into cups is explained by Theopompus: and it is very likely\n that Pelias may have had cups made of these horns; and Iolcos is near the\n Molossian district, and it was at Iolcos that these contests spoken of were\n exhibited by Pelias.\u2014 But, says Didymus, in his Explanation of the\n play here spoken of, it is better to say that Ion misunderstood Homer's\n words, where he says\u2014 \n And for the fifth he gave a double bowl, \n Which fire had never touch'd; \n for he fancied that this meant a drinking-cup, while it was in reality\n a large flat vessel made of brass in the form of a caldron, suitable to receive\n cold water. And he has spoken of the dactylotus cup, as if it were a goblet\n that had a hollow place all round the inside of it, so as to be taken hold of\n inside by the fingers of the drinkers. And some say that the cup which has\n never been touched by fire means a cup of horn; for that that is not worked by\n the agency of fire. And perhaps a man might call a \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 a drinking-cup by a metaphorical use of the word. \n But Philemon, in his treatise on Attic Nouns and Attic Dialects, under the word\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c0\u1f76\u03c2 says, \"The dactylotus cup is the same as\n the two-headed cup into which a person can insert his fingers\n on both sides. But some say that it is one which has figures in the shape of\n fingers carved all round it.\" \n ","34":"\n There is also the elephant; and this was the name of a kind of cup, as we are told\n by Damoxenus, in the Man who laments himself\u2014 \n \n A.

When I was at Cypseli, \n Ad\u00e6us pledged me in this selfsame cup. \n And Epinicus also mentions this cup, in his Supposititious Damsels; and I\n will quote his testimony when I come to speak of the rhytum. \n ","35":"\n There is another kind of cup called the Ephebus. And Philemon the Athenian, in his\n treatise on Attic Nouns and Attic Dialects, says that this cup is also called the\n embasicoitas; but Stephanus the comic poet, in his Friend of the Laced\u00e6monians,\n says\u2014 \n \n Sos. The king then pledged him in a certain\n village. \n \n B. A wondrous thing. What can you mean? Is this \n A kind of goblet? \n \n Sos. No; I mean a village \n Near Thyria. \n \n B. Why, my whole thoughts were borne \n Off to the Rhodian cups, O Sosia, \n And to those heavy bowls they call ephebi. \n \n \n ","36":"\n There are also some cups which are called \u1f21\u03b4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n These, says Lynceus the Samian, \"were made by the Rhodians in\n emulation of the Thericlean goblets which were in use at Athens. But as the\n Athenians, on account of the great weight of metal employed in them, only made\n this shape for the use of the richer classes, the Rhodians made theirs so light\n that they were able to put these ornaments within the reach even of the poor. And\n Epigenes mentions them, in his Heroine, in these words\u2014 \n A psycter, and a cyathus, and cymbia, \n Four rhyta, and three hedypotides, \n A silver strainer, too. \n And Sermus, in the fifth book of his Delias, says that there is among the offerings at Delos a golden hedypotis, the gift of\n Echenica, a woman of the country, whom he mentions also, in his eighth book. And\n Cratinus the younger says, using the diminutive form,\u2014 \n And Archephon had twelve \u1f21\u03b4\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n \n \n ","37":"\n There was another kind of cup called the Herculeum. Pisander, in the second book\n of his Herculead, says that the cup in which Hercules sailed across the ocean\n belonged to the Sun; and that Hercules received it from Oceanus for that purpose.\n But, perhaps, as the hero was fond of large cups, the poets and historians jesting\n because of the great size of this one, invented the fable of his having gone to\n sea in a cup. But Panyasis, in the first book of his Herculead, says that Hercules\n obtained the cup of the Sun from Nereus, and sailed even to Erythea in it. And we\n have said before that Hercules was one of the inordinate drinkers. And that the\n sun was borne on towards his setting in a cup, Stesichorus tells us, where he\n says\u2014 \n And then the Sun, great Hyperion's offspring, \n Embarked in his golden cup, that he \n Might cross the ocean's wide expanse, and come \n To the deep foundations of immortal Night; \n To his fond mother, and his virgin bride, \n And his dear children. And the son of Jove \n Came to the grove \n Shaded with laurels and with bays. \n And Antimachus speaks thus\u2014 \n And then the most illustrious Erythea \n Sent the Sun forth in a convenient cup. \n And Aeschylus, in his Daughters of the Sun, says\u2014 \n There in the west is found the golden cup, \n Great Vulcan's work, your father's property, \n In which he's borne along his rapid course \n O'er the dark waters of the boundless sea. \n When, his work done, he flies before dark Night, \n Borne on her black-horsed chariot. \n \n \n ","38":"\n And Mimnermus, in his Nannus, says that the Sun when asleep is borne round to the\n east, lying on a golden bed which was made for this express purpose by Vulcan; by\n which enigmatical statement he indicates the hollow form of the cup; and he speaks\n thus\u2014 \n For the Sun labours every day, nor ever \n Do he or his fleet steeds know pleasing rest \n From that bright hour when the rosy Morn, \n Leaving her ocean-bed, mounts up to heaven. \n \n For all across the sea, a lovely bed \n Of precious gold, the work of Vulcan's hands, \n Conveys the god; passing on rapid wings \n Along the water, while he sleeps therein, \n From the bright region of th' Hesperides, \n To th' Ethiopian shore, where his swift car \n And fiery horses wait within their stalls \n Till bright Aurora comes again and opes \n Her rosy portals. Then Hyperion's son \n Ascends again his swift untiring car. \n But Theolytus, in the second book of his Annals, says that the Sun\n crosses the sea in a cup, and that the first person who invented this statement\n was the author of the poem called the Battle of the Titans. And Pherecydes, in the\n third book of his Histories, having previously spoken about the ocean,\n adds\u2014 But Hercules drew his bow against him, as if he meant to shoot him:\n and the Sun bade him desist, and so he, being afraid, did desist. And in return\n for his forbearance, the Sun gave him the golden cup in which he himself used\n to travel with his horses when he has set, going all night across the ocean to\n the east, where he again rises. And so then Hercules went in this cup to\n Erythea. And when he was at sea, Oceanus, to tempt him, appeared to him in\n visible form, tossing his cup about in the waves; and he then was on the point\n of shooting Oceanus; but Oceanus being frightened desired him to\n forbear. \n \n ","39":"\n There is also a cup of the name of ethanion. Hellanicus, in his account of the\n History and Manners of the Egyptians, writes thus\u2014 In the houses of the\n Egyptians are found a brazen \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, and a\n brazen \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, and a brazen \u1f20\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n \n There is another kind called hemitomus; a sort of cup in use among the Athenians,\n so called from its shape and it is mentioned by Pamphilus, in his Dialects. \n ","40":"\n Then there is the cup called the thericlean cup; this kind is depressed at the\n sides, sufficiently deep, having short ears, as being of the class of cup called\n \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. \n And, perhaps, it is out of a thericlean cup that Alexis, in his Hesione,\n represents Hercules to be drinking, when he speaks thus\u2014 \n \n And when he had, though scarcely, come t' himself, \n He begg'd a cup of wine ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 ), and when\n he'd got it, \n He drank down frequent draughts, and drain'd it well; \n And, as the proverb says, the man sometimes \n Is quite a bladder, and sometimes a sack. \n And that the thericlean cup belongs to the class \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be is plainly stated by Theophrastus, in his History of Plants.\n For speaking of the turpentine-tree, be says\u2014 And thericlean cups ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ) are turned of this wood, in such\n a manner that no one can distinguish them from earthenware ones. And\n Thericles the Corinthian is said to have been the first maker of this kind of cup,\n and he was a potter originally, and it is after him that they have their name; and\n he lived about the same time as Aristophanes the comic poet. And Theopompus speaks\n of this cup, in his Nemea, where he says\u2014 \n \n A. Come hither you, you faithful child of\n Thericles, \n You noble shape, and what name shall we give you \n Are you a looking-glass of nature? If \n You were but full, then I could wish for nothing \n Beyond your presence. Come then\u2014 \n \n B. How I hate you, \n You old Theolyta. \n \n A. Old dost thou call me, friend? \n \n B. What can I call you else? but hither come, \n Let me embrace you; come to your fellow-servant: \n Is it not so? \n \n A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . you try me. \n \n B. See here I pledge you in fair friendship's\n cup. \n \n A. And when you've drunk your fill, then hand the\n cup \n Over to me the first. \n But Cleanthes, in his treatise on Interpretation, says\u2014 And as for\n all these inventions, and whatever others there are of the same kind, such as\n the thericlean cup, the deinias, the iphicratis, it is quite plain that these,\n by their very names, indicate their inventors. And the same appears to be the\n case even now. And if they fail to do so, the name must have changed its\n meaning a little. But, as has been said before, one cannot in every case trust\n to a name. But others state that the thericlean cup has its name from\n the skins of wild beasts ( \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ) being carved on\n it. And Pamphilus of Alexandria says that it is so called from the fact of Bacchus\n disturbing the beasts ( \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b8\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ) by pouring\n libations out of these cups over them. \n \n ","41":"\n And Antiphanes mentions this kind of cup, in his Similitudes, saying\u2014 \n And when they had done supper, (for I wish \n To put all things that happen'd in the interval \n Together,) then the thericlean cup \n Of Jove the Saviour was introduced, \n Full of the luscious drops which o'er the sea \n Came from the isle of the delicious drinks, \n The sea-girt Lesbos, full, and foaming up, \n And each one in his right hand gladly seized it. \n And Eubulus, in his Dolon, says\u2014 \n I never drain'd a cup more carefully, \n For I did make the earthen cask more clean \n Than Thericles did make his well-turn'd cups \n E'en in his youth. \n And, in his Dice-players, he says\u2014 \n And then they drain'd the valiant cup yclept \n The thericlean; foaming o'er the brim, \n With Laced\u00e6monian lip, loud sounding \n As if 'twere full of pebbles, dark in colour, \n A beauteous circle, with a narrow bottom, \n Sparkling and brilliant, beautifully wash'd, \n All crown'd with ivy; and the while they call'd \n On the great name of Jove the Saviour. \n And Ararus, or Eubulus, whichever it was who was the author of the\n Campylion, says\u2014 \n O potter's earth, you whom great Thericles \n Once fashion'd, widening out the circling depth \n Of your large hollow sides; right well must you \n Have known the natures and the hearts of women, \n That they are not well pleased with scanty cups. \n And Alexis, in his Horseman, says\u2014 \n There is, besides, a thericlean cup, \n Having a golden wreath of ivy round it, \n Carved on it, not appended. \n And in his Little Horse he says\u2014 \n He drank a thericlean cup of unmix'd wine, \n Right full, and foaming o'er the brim. \n \n \n ","42":"\n But Tim\u00e6us, in the twenty-eighth book of his History, calls the cup thericlea,\n writing thus:\u2014 There was man of the name of Polyxenus who was appointed one\n of the ambassadors from Tauromenium, and he returned having received several\n other presents from Nicodemus, and also a cup of the kind called\n thericlea. And Ad\u00e6us, in his treatise on\n Descriptions, considers that the thericleum and the car- chesium are the same. But\n that they are different is plainly shown by Callixenus, who, in his Account of\n Alexandria and its customs, says\u2014 And some people marched in the procession,\n bearing thericlea (and he uses the masculine form \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ), and others bearing carchesia. And what kind\n of cup the carchesium was, shall be explained in due time. There is also another\n kind called the thericlean bowl ( \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\n \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 ), which is mentioned by Alexis, in his Cycnus\u2014 \n And in the midst a thericlean bowl \n Resplendent stood; full of old clear white wine, \n And foaming to the brim. I took it empty, \n And wiped it round, and made it shine, and placed it \n Firm on its base, and crown'd it round with branches \n Of Bacchus' favourite ivy. \n Menander also has used the form \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as feminine, in his Fanatic Woman, when he says\u2014 \n And being moderately drunk, he took \n And drain'd the thericleum ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd\n \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And in his Begging Priest he says\u2014 \n Drinking a thericleum of three pints. \n And Deoxippus, in his Miser, says\u2014 \n \n A. I want now the large thericlean cup ( \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n \n B. I know it well. \n \n A. Likewise the Rhodian cups; \n For when I've pour'd the liquor into them, \n I always seem to drink it with most pleasure. \n And Polemo, in the first book of his treatise on the Acropolis at Athens,\n has used the word in the neuter gender, saying\u2014 Neoptolemus offered up some\n golden thericlean cups ( \u03c4\u1f70 \n \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ) wrought on foundations of\n wood. \n \n ","43":"\n And Apollodorus of Gela, in his Philadelphi, or the Man who killed himself by\n Starvation, says\u2014 \n Then there were robes of fine embroidery, \n And silver plate, and very skilful chasers \n Who ornament the thericlean cups, \n And many other noble bowls besides. \n And Aristophon, in his Philonides, says\u2014 \n Therefore my master very lately took \n The well-turn'd orb of a thericlean cup, \n Full foaming to the brim with luscious wine, \n Mix'd half-and-half, a most luxurious draught, \n \n And gave it me as a reward for virtue; \n I think because of my tried honesty; \n And then, by steeping me completely in it, \n He set me free. \n And Theophilus, in his B\u0153otia, says\u2014 \n He mixes beautifully a large cup \n Of earthenware, of thericlean fashion, \n Holding four pints, and foaming o'er the brim; \n Not Autocles himself, by earth I swear, \n Could in his hand more gracefully have borne it. \n And, in his Pr\u0153tides, he says\u2014 \n And bring a thericlean cup, which holds \n More than four pints, and's sacred to good fortune. \n There is also a cup called the Isthmian cup: and Pamphilus, in his\n treatise on Names, says that this is a name given to a certain kind of cup by the\n inhabitants of Cyprus. \n ","44":"\n There is also a kind of vessel called cadus; which Simmias states to be a kind of\n cup, quoting this verse of Anacreon\u2014 \n I breakfasted on one small piece of cheesecake, \n And drank a cadus full of wine. \n And Epigenes, in his Little Monument, says\u2014 \n \n A. Craters, and cadi, olkia, and crunea. \n \n B. Are these crunea? \n \n A. To be sure these are, \n Luteria, too. But why need I name each \n For you yourself shall see them. \n \n B. Do you say \n That the great monarch's son, Pixodarus, \n Has come to this our land? \n And Hedylus, in his Epigrams, says\u2014 \n Let us then drink; perhaps among our cups \n We may on some new wise and merry plan \n With all good fortune light. Come, soak me well \n In cups ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 ) of Chian wine, and say to\n me, \n \n Come, sport and drink, good Hedylus; I hate \n To live an empty life, debarr'd from wine. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n From morn till night, and then from night till morn, \n The thirsty Pasisocles sits and drinks, \n In monstrous goblets ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 ), holding quite\n four quarts, \n And then departs whatever way he pleases. \n But midst his cups he sports more mirthfully, \n And is much stronger than Sicelides. \n How his wit sparkles I Follow his example, \n And ever as you write, my friend, drink too. \n \n But Clitarchus, in his treatise on Dialects, says that the\n Ionians call an earthenware cask \u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2. And\n Herodotus, in his third book, speaks of a cask ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ) of palm wine. \n ","45":"\n There is also the \u03ba\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 Philemon, in his\n treatise before mentioned, says that this too is a species of cup. And it is a\n vessel in which they place the Ctesian Jupiters, as Anticlides says, in his Book\n on Omens, where he writes,\u2014 The statuettes of Jupiter Ctesius ought to be\n erected in this manner. One ought to place a new cadiscus with two ears . .\n .\u2014and crown the ears with white wool; and on the right shoulder, and on the\n forehead . . . . and put on it what you find there, and pour ambrosia over it.\n But ambrosia is compounded of pure water, and oil, and all kinds of fruits; and\n these you must pour over. Stratis the comic poet also mentions the\n cadiscus, in his Lemnomeda, where he says\u2014 \n The wine of Mercury, which some draw forth \n From a large jug, and some from a cadiscus, \n Mix'd with pure water, half-and-half. \n \n \n ","46":"\n There is also the cantharus. Now, that this is the name of a kind of boat is well\n known. And that there is a kind of cup also called by this name we find from\n Ameipsias, in his Men Playing at the Cottabus, or Madness, where he says\u2014 \n Bring here the vinegar cruets, and canthari. \n And Alexis, in his Creation (the sentence refers to some one drinking in\n a wine-shop), says\u2014 \n And then I saw Hermaiscus turning over \n One of these mighty canthari, and near him \n There lay a blanket, and his well-fill'd wallet. \n And Eubulus, who often mentions this cup by name, in his Pamphilus, says\u2014\n \n But I (for opposite the house there was \n A wine-shop recently establish'd) \n There watch'd the damsel's nurse; and bade the vintner \n Mix me a measure of wine worth an obol, \n And set before me a full-sized cantharus. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n How dry and empty is this cantharus! \n And again, in another place- \n Soon as she took it, she did drink it up,\u2014 \n How much d'ye think? a most enormous draught; \n And drain'd the cantharus completely dry. \n \n And Xenarchus, in his Priapus, says this\u2014 \n Pour, boy, no longer in the silver tankard, \n But let us have again recourse to the deep. \n Pour, boy, I bid you, in the cantharus, \n Pour quick, by Jove, aye, by the Cantharus, pour. \n And Epigenes, in his Heroine, says\u2014 \n But now they do no longer canthari make, \n At least not large ones; but small shallow cups \n Are come in fashion, and they call them neater, \n As if they drank the cups, and not the wine. \n \n \n ","47":"\n And Sosicrates, in his Philadelphi, says\u2014 \n A gentle breeze mocking the curling waves, \n Sciron's fair daughter, gently on its course \n Brought with a noiseless foot the cantharus; \n here cantharus evidently means a boat. \n And Phrynichus, in his Revellers, says\u2013 \n And then Ch\u00e6restratus, in his own abode, \n Working with modest zeal, did weep each day \n A hundred canthari well fill'd with wine. \n And Nicostratus, in his Calumniator, says\u2014 \n \n A. Is it a ship of twenty banks of oars, \n Or a swan, or a cantharus? For when \n I have learnt that, I then shall be prepared \n Myself t' encounter everything. \n \n B. It is \n A cycnocantharus, an animal \n Compounded carefully of each. \n And Menander, in his Captain of a Ship, says\u2014 \n \n A. Leaving the salt depths of the Aegean sea, \n Theophilus has come to us, O Strato. \n How seasonably now do I say your son \n Is in a prosperous and good condition, \n And so's that golden cantharus. \n \n B. What cantharus? \n \n A. Your vessel. \n And a few lines afterwards he says\u2014 \n \n B. You say my ship is safe? \n \n A. Indeed I do, \n That gallant ship which Callicles did build, \n And which the Thurian Euphranor steer'd. \n And Polemo, in his treatise on Painters, addressed to Antigonus, says\u2014\"At\n Athens, at the marriage of Pirithous, Hippeus made a wine jug\n and goblet of stone, inlaying its edges with gold. And he provided also couches of\n pinewood placed on the ground, adorned with coverlets of every sort, and for\n drinking cups there were canthari made of earthenware. And moreover, the lamp\n which was suspended from the roof, had a number of lights all kept distinct from\n one another. And that this kind of cup got its name originally from Cantharus a\n potter, who invented it, Philet\u00e6rus tells us in his Achilles\u2014 \n Peleus\u2014but Peleus is a potter's name, \n The name of some dry withered lamp-maker, \n Known too as Cantharus, exceeding poor, \n Far other than a king, by Jove. \n And that cantharus is also the name of a piece of female ornament, we may\n gather from Antiphanes in his B\u0153otia. \n ","48":"\n There is also a kind of cup called carchesium. Callixenus the Rhodian, in' his\n History of the Affairs and Customs of Alexandria, says that it is a cup of an\n oblong shape, slightly contracted in the middle, having ears which reach down to\n the bottom. And indeed, the carchesium is a tolerably oblong cup, and perhaps it\n has its name from its being stretched upwards. But the carchesium is an extremely\n old description of cup; if at least it is true that Jupiter, when he had gained\n the affections of Alcmena, gave her one as a love gift, as Pherecydes relates in\n his second book, and Herodorus of Heraclea tells the same story. But Asclepiades\n the Myrlean says that this cup derives its name from some one of the parts of the\n equipment of a ship. For the lower part of the mast is called the pterna, which\n goes down into the socket; and the middle of the mast is called the neck; and\n towards the upper part it is called carchesium. And the carchesium has yards\n running out on each side, and in it there is placed what is called the\n breastplate, being four-cornered on all sides, except just at the bottom and at\n the top. Both of which extend a little outwards in a straight line. And above the\n breastplate is a part which is called the distaff, running up to a great height,\n and being sharp-pointed. And Sappho also speaks of the carchesia, where she says\u2014\n \n \n And they all had well-fill'd carchesia, \n And out of them they pour'd libations, wishing \n All manner of good fortune to the bridegroom. \n And Sophocles, in his Tyro, says\u2014 \n And they were at the table in the middle, \n Between the dishes and carchesia; \n saying that the dragons came up to the table, and took up a position\n between the meats and the carchesia, or cups of wine. For it was the fashion among\n the ancients to place upon the table goblets containing mixed wine; as Homer also\n represents the tables in his time. And the carchesium was named so from having on\n it rough masses like millet ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1f74\u03c2 ), and the\n \u03b1 is by enallage instead of \u03b5, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd for \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. On which account Homer calls those who are overcome by\n thirst \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1- \n \u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. And Charon of Lampsacus, in his Annals,\n says that among the Laced\u00e6monians there is still shown the very same cup which was\n given by Jupiter to Alcmena, when he took upon himself the likeness of\n Amphitryon. \n There is another kind of cup called calpium, a sort of Erythr\u00e6an goblet, as\n Pamphilus says; and I imagine it is the same as the one called scaphium. \n ","49":"\n There is another kind of cup called celebe. And this description of drinking-cup\n is mentioned by Anacreon, where he says\u2014 \n Come, O boy, and bring me now \n A celebe, that I may drink \n A long deep draught, and draw no breath. \n It will ten measures of water hold, \n And five of mighty Chian wine. \n But it is uncertain what description of cup it is, or whether every cup\n is not called celebe, because one pours libations into it ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c7\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03b2\u1f74\u03bd ),or from one's pouring libations ( \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ). And the verb \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b2\u03c9 is applied habitually to every sort of liquid, from which also\n the word \u03bb\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03c2 is derived. But Silenus and\n Clitarchus say that celebe is a name given to drinking-cups by the Aeolians. But\n Pamphilus says that the celebe is the same cup which is also called thermopotis, a\n cup to drink warm water from. And Nicander the Colophonian, in his Dialects, says\n that the celebe is a vessel used by the shepherds in which they preserve honey.\n For Anti- machus the Colophonian, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says\u2014 \n \n He bade the heralds bear to them a bladder \n Fill'd with dark wine, and the most choice of all, \n The celebea in his house which lay, \n Fill'd with pure honey. \n And in a subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n But taking up a mighty celebeum \n In both his hands, well filled with richest honey, \n Which in great store he had most excellent. \n And again he says\u2014 \n And golden cups of wine, and then besides, \n A celebeum yet untouch'd by man, \n Full of pure honey, his most choice of treasures. \n And in this passage he very evidently speaks of the celebeum as some kind\n of vessel distinct from a drinking-cup, since he has already mentioned\n drinking-cups under the title of \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1. And\n Theocritus the Syracusan, in his Female Witches, says\u2014 \n And crown this celebeum with the wool, \n Well dyed in scarlet, of the fleecy sheep. \n And Euphorion says\u2014 \n Or whether you from any other stream \n Have fill'd your celebe with limpid water. \n And Anacreon says\u2014 \n And the attendant pour'd forth luscious wile, \n Holding a celebe of goodly size. \n But Dionysius, surnamed the Slender, explaining the poem of Theodoridas,\n which is addressed to Love, says that celebe is a name given to a kind of\n upstanding cup, something like the prusias and the thericleum. \n ","50":"\n There is also the horn. It is said that the first men drank out of the horns of\n oxen; from which circumstance Bacchus often figured with horns on his head, and is\n moreover called a bull by many of the poets. And at Cyzicus there is a statue of\n him with a bull's head. But that men drank out of horns ( \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ) is plain from the fact that to this very day, when men mix\n water with wine, they say that they \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 (mix\n it). And the vessel in which the wine is mixed is called \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1, from the fact of the water being mingled ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b9\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) in it, as if the word were \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1, from the drink being poured \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (into the horn); and even to this day the\n fashion of making horns into cups con- tinues: but some people call these cups\n rhyta. And many of the poets represent the ancients as\n drinking out of horns. Pindar, speaking of the Centaurs, says\u2014 \n After those monsters fierce \n Learnt the invincible strength of luscious wine; \n Then with a sudden fury, \n With mighty hands they threw the snow-white milk \n Down from the board, \n And of their own accord \n Drank away their senses in the silver-mounted horns. \n And Xenophon, in the seventh book of his Anabasis, giving an account of\n the banquet which was given by the Thracian Seuthes, writes thus: But when\n Xenophon, with his companions, arrived at Seuthes's palace, first of all they\n embraced one another, and then, according to the Thracian fashion, they were\n presented with horns of wine. And in his sixth book he says, when he is\n speaking of the Paphlagonians, And they supped lying on couches made of\n leaves, and they drank out of cups made of horn. And Aeschylus, in his\n Perrh\u00e6bi, represents the Perrh\u00e6bi as using horns for cups, in the following\n lines:\u2014 \n With silver-mounted horns, \n Fitted with mouthpieces of rich-wrought gold. \n And Sophocles, in his Pandora, says\u2014 \n And when a man has drain'd the golden cup, \n She, pressing it beneath her tender arm, \n Returns it to him full. \n And Hermippus, in his Fates, says\u2014 \n Do you now know the thing you ought to do? \n Give not that cup to me; but from this horn \n Give me but once more now to drink a draught. \n And Lycurgus the orator, in his Oration against Demades, says that Philip\n the king pledged those men whom he loved in a horn. And Theopompus, in the second\n book of his history of the Affairs and Actions of Philip, says that the kings of\n the P\u00e6onians, as the oxen in their countries have enormous horns, so large as to\n contain three or four choes of wine, make drinking-cups of them, covering over the\n brims with silver or with gold. And Philoxenus of Cythera, in his poem entitled\n The Supper, says\u2014 \n He then the sacred drink of nectar quaff'd \n From the gold-mounted brims of th' ample horns, \n And then they all did drink awhile. \n And the Athenians made also silver goblets in the shape of horns, and drank out of them. And one may ascertain that by\n seeing the articles mentioned in writing among the list of confiscated goods on\n the pillar which lies in the Acropolis, which contains the sacred\n offerings\u2014 There is also a silver horn drinking-cup, very solid. \n \n ","51":"\n There is also the cernus. This is a vessel made of earthenware, having many little\n cup-like figures fastened to it, in which are white poppies, wheat-ears, grains of\n barley, peas, pulse, vetches, and lentils. And he who carries it, like the man who\n carries the mystic fan, eats of these things, as Ammonius relates in the third\n book of his treatise on Altars and Sacrifices. \n ","52":"\n There is also the cup called the cissybium. This is a cup with but one handle, as\n Philemon says. And Neoptolemus the Parian, in the third book of his Dialects, says\n that this word is used by Euripides in the Andromache, to signify a cup made of\n ivy ( \u03ba\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd )\u2014 \n And all the crowd of shepherds flock'd together, \n One bearing a huge ivy bowl of milk, \n Refreshing medicine of weary toil; \n Another brought the juice o' the purple vine. \n For, says he, the cissybium is mentioned in a rustic assembly, where it\n is most natural that the cups should be made of wood. But Clitarchus says that the\n Aeolians called the cup which is elsewhere called scyphus, cissybium. And Marsyas\n says that it is a wooden cup, the same as the \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. But Eumolpus says that it is a species of cup which\n perhaps (says he) was originally made of the wood of the ivy. But Nicander the\n Colophonian, in the first book of his History of Aetolia, writes thus:\u2014\"In the\n sacred festival of Jupiter Didym\u00e6us they pour libations from leaves of ivy\n ( \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6 ), from which circumstance the ancient\n cups are called cissybia. Homer says\u2014 \n Holding a cup ( \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) of dark\n rich-colour'd wine. \n And Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his essay on the cup called Nestoris,\n says, No one of the men in the city or of the men of moderate fortune used\n to use the \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 or the \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, but only the swineherds and the shepherds, and the men\n in the fields. Polyphemus used the cissybium, and Eum\u00e6us the other\n kind. But Callimachus seems to make a blunder in the use of these\n names, speaking of an intimate friend of his who was\n entertained with him at a banquet by Pollis the Athenian, for he says\u2014 \n For he abhorr'd to drink at one long draught \n Th' amystis loved in Thrace, not drawing breath: \n And soberly preferr'd a small cissybium: \n And when for the third time the cup ( \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd ) went round, \n I thus addressed him . . . . . . \n For, as he here calls the same cup both \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd, he does not\n preserve the accurate distinction between the names. And any one may conjecture\n that the \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was originally made by the\n shepherds out of the wood of the ivy ( \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 ). But\n some derive it from the verb \u03c7\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, used in the\n same sense as \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9, to contain; as it occurs in\n the fol- lowing line:\u2014 \n This threshold shall contain ( \u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ) them\n both. \n And the hole of the serpent is also called \u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b7, as containing the animal; and they also give the name of\n \u03ba\u03ae\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, that is, \u03c7\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, to the box which holds the dice. And Dionysius of Samos, in\n his treatise on the Cyclic Poets, calls the cup which Homer calls \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, writing thus\u2014 And Ulysses,\n when he saw him acting thus, having filled a \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd with wine, gave it to him to drink. \n \n ","53":"\n There is also the ciborium. Hegesander the Delphian says that Euphorion the poet,\n when supping with the Prytanis, when the Prytanis exhibited to him some ciboria,\n which appeared to be made in a most exquisite and costly manner, . . . . . . . .\n And when the cup had gone round pretty often, he, having drunk very hard and being\n intoxicated, took one of the ciboria and defiled it. And Didymus says that it is a\n kind of drinking-cup; and perhaps it may be the same as that which is called\n scyphium, which derives its name from being contracted to a narrow space at the\n bottom, like the Egyptian ciboria. \n ","54":"\n There is also the condu, an Asiatic cup. (Menander, in his play entitled the\n Flatterer, says\u2014 \n Then, too, there is in Cappadocia, \n O Struthion, a noble golden cup, \n Called condu, holding ten full cotyle. \n And Hipparchus says, in his Men Saved,\u2014 \n \n A. Why do you so attend to this one soldier? \n He has no silver anywhere, I know well; \n But at the most one small embroider'd carpet, \n \n (And that is quite enough for him,) on which \n Some Persian figures and preposterous shapes \n Of Persian griffins, and such beasts, are work'd. \n \n B Away with you, you wretch. \n \n A. And then he has \n A condu, a wine-cooler, and a cymbium. \n And Nicomachus, in the first book of his treatise on the Egyptian\n Festivals, says\u2014 But the condu is a Persian cup; and it was first introduced\n by Hermippus the astrologer. . . . . . . . . . . .\n . on which account libations are poured out of it. But Pancrates, in\n the first book of his Conchoreis, says\u2014 \n But he first pour'd libations to the gods \n From a large silver condu; then he rose, \n And straight departed by another road. \n \n \n There is also the cononius. Ister, the pupil of Callimachus, in the first book of\n his History of Ptolemais, the city in Egypt, writes thus:\u2014\"A pair of cups, called\n cononii, and a pair of therielean cups with golden covers. \n ","55":"\n There is also the cotylus. The cotylus is a cup with one handle, which is also\n mentioned by Alc\u00e6us. But Diodorus, in his book addressed to Lycophron, says that\n this cup is greatly used by the Sicyonians and Tarentines, and that it is like a\n deep luterium, and sometimes it has an ear. And Ion the Chian also mentions it,\n speaking of a cotylus full of wine. ! And Hermippus, in his Gods,\n says\u2014 \n He brought a cotylus first, a pledge for his neighbours. \n And Plato, in his Jupiter Afflicted, says\u2014 \n He brings a cotylus. \n Aristophanes also, in his Babylonians, mentions the cotylus; and Eubulus,\n in his Ulysses, or the Panopt\u00e6, says\u2014 \n And then the priest utt'ring well-omen'd prayers, \n Stood in the midst, and in a gorgeous dress, \n Pour'd a libation from the cotylus. \n And Pamphilus says that it is a kind of cup, and peculiar to Bacchus. But\n Polemo, in his treatise on the Fleece of the Sheep sacrificed to Jupiter,\n says\u2014 And after this he celebrates a sacrifice, and takes the sacred\n fleece out of its shrine, and distributes it among all those who have borne the\n cernus in the procession: and this is a vessel made of earthenware, having a\n number of little cups glued to it; and in these little \n cups there is put sage, and white poppies, and ears of wheat, and grains of\n barley, and peas, and pulse, and rye, and lentils, and beans, and vetches, and\n bruised figs, and chaff and oil, and honey, and milk, and wine, and pieces of\n unwashed sheep's-wool. And he who has carried this cernus eats of all these\n things, like the man who has carried the mystic fan. \n \n ","56":"\n There is also the cotyle. Aristophanes, in his Cocalus, says\u2014 \n And other women, more advanced in age, \n Into their stomachs pour'd, without restraint, \n From good-sized cotyl\u00e6, dark Thasian wine, \n The whole contents of a large earthen jar, \n Urged by their mighty love for the dark wine. \n And Silenus, and Clitarchus, and also Zenodotus; say that it is a kind of\n \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be, and say\u2014 \n And all around the corpse the black blood flow'd, \n As if pour'd out from some full cotyle. \n And again\u2014 \n There is many a slip \n 'Twixt the cup ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 ) and the lip. \n And Simaristus says that it is a very small-sized cup which is called by\n this name; and Diodorus says that the poet has here called the cup by the name of\n cotyle, which is by others called cotylus, as where we find- \u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (bread) \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd; and that\n it is not of the class \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be, for that it has no\n handles, but that it is very like a deep luterium, and a kind of drinking cup\n ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 ); and that it is the same as that\n which by the Aetolians, and by some tribes of the Ionians, is called cotylus,\n which is like those which have been already described, except that it has only one\n ear: and Crates mentions it in his Sports, and Hermippus in his Gods. But the\n Athenians give the name of \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 to a certain\n measure. Thucydides says\u2014 They gave to each of them provisions for eight\n months, at the rate of a cotyla of water and two cotyl\u00e6 of corn a-day. \n Aristophanes, in his Proagon, says\u2014 \n And having bought three ch\u0153nixes of meal, \n All but one cotyla, he accounts for twenty. \n But Apollodorus says that it is a kind of cup, deep and hollow; and he\n says\u2014 The ancients used to call everything that was hollow \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7, as, for instance, the hollow of the hand; on\n which account we find the expression \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \n \n \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1\u2014 meaning, blood in such quantities that it\n could be taken up in the hand. And there was a game called \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7, in which those who are defeated make their\n hands hollow, and then take hold of the knees of those who have won the game\n and carry them. And Diodorus, in his Italian Dialects, and Heraclitus\n (as Pamphilus says), relate that the cotyla is also called hemina, quoting the\n following passage of Epicharmus:\u2014 \n And then to drink a double measure, \n Two hemin\u00e6 of tepid water full, \n And Sophron says\u2014 \n Turn up the hemina, O boy. \n But Pherecrates calls it a cotylisca, in his Corianno, saying\u2014 \n The cotylisca? By no means. \n And Aristophanes, in his Acharnians, uses a still more diminutive form,\n and says\u2014 \n A cotyliscium ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) with a broken\n lip. \n And even the hollow of the hip is called \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7; and the excrescences on the feelers of the polypus are, by a\n slight extension of the word, called \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b7\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd. \n And Aeschylus, in his Edonians, has called cymbals also \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9, saying\u2014 \n And he makes music with his brazen \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n But Marsyas says that the bone of the hip is also called \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd and \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. And\n the sacred bowl of Bacchus is called \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2; \n and so are those goblets which the initiated use for their libations; as Nicander\n of Thyatira says, adducing the following passage from the Clouds of Aristophanes:\u2014\n \n Nor will I crown the cotyliscus. \n \n \n And Simmias interprets the word \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 by\n \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n \n \n ","57":"\n There is also the cottabis. Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise on the Laws and\n Customs of Phigalea, going through the entertainments peculiar to different\n countries, writes as follows:\u2014 When they have performed all these\n purificatory ceremonies, a small draught is offered to each person to drink in\n a cottabis of earthenware; and he who offers it says, 'May you sup\n well.' But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries (the beginning\n of which is In the best Form of Government ), says\u2014 That which\n is called the cottabus has been introduced into entertainments, the Sicilians\n (as Dic\u00e6archus relates) having been the first people to introduce it. And such\n great fondness was ex- hibited for this amusement, that\n men even introduced into entertainments contests, which were called cottabia\n games; and then cups of the form which appeared to be most suitable for such an\n exercise were made, called cottabide. And besides all this, rooms were built of\n a round figure, in order that all, the cottabus being placed in the middle\n might contest the victory, all being at an equal distance, and in similar\n situations. For they vied with one another, not only in throwing their liquor\n at the mark, but also in doing everything with elegance; for a man was bound to\n lean on his left elbow, and, making a circuit with his right hand, to throw his\n drops ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1 ) over gently\u2014for that was the\n name which they gave to the liquor which fell from the cup: so that some prided\n themselves more on playing elegantly at the cottabus than others did on their\n skill with the javelin. \n \n ","58":"\n There is also the cratanium. But perhaps this is the same cup, under an ancient\n name, as that which is now called the craneum: accordingly, Polemo (or whoever it\n is who wrote the treatise on the Manners and Customs of the Greeks), speaking of\n the temple of the Metapontines which is at Olympia, writes as follows:\u2014 The\n temple of the Metapontines, in which there are a hundred and thirty-two silver\n phial\u00e6, and two silver wine-jars, and a silver apothystanium, and three gilt\n phial\u00e6. The temple of the Byzantians, in which there is a figure of Triton,\n made of cypress-wood, holding a silver cratanium, a silver siren, two silver\n carchesia, a silver culix, a golden wine-jar, and two horns. But in the old\n temple of Juno, there are thirty silver phial\u00e6, two silver cratania, a silver\n dish, a golden apothystanium, a golden crater (the offering of the Cyren\u00e6ans),\n and a silver batiacium. \n \n There is also the crounea. Epigenes, in his Monument, says\u2014 \n \n A. Crateres, cadi, holcia, crounea, \n \n B. Are these crounea? \n \n A. Yes, indeed these are. \n There is the cyathis also. This is a vessel with a great resemblance to\n the cotyla. Sophron, in his play entitled the Buffoon, represents the women who\n profess to exhibit the goddess as present, as saying\u2014 \n Three sovereign antidotes for poison \n Are buried in a single cyathis. \n \n \n \n ","59":"\n Then there is the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. Pherecrates, in his Slave\n Tutor, says\u2014 \n Now wash the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be out; I'll give you\n then \n Some wine to drink: put o'er the cup a strainer, \n And then pour in some wine. \n \n \n But the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be is a drinking-cup made of\n earthenware, and it is so called from being made circular ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) by the potter's wheel; from which also the\n \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, the place in which the cups are\n stored up, gets its name, even when the cups put away in it are made of silver.\n There is also the verb \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9, derived from\n the same source, when any one makes an harangue over his cups But the Athenians\n also call a medicine chest \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f76\u03c2, because it is\n made round in a turning-lathe. And the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \n both at Argos and at Athens, were in great repute; and Pindar mentions the Attic\n \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 in the following lines\u2014 \n O Thrasybulus, now I send \n This pair of pleasantly-meant odes \n As an after-supper entertainment for you. \n May it, I pray, be pleasing \n To all the guests, and may it be a spur \n To draw on cups of wine, \n And richly-fill'd Athenian \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n ","60":"\n But the Argive \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 appear to have been of a\n different shape from the Athenian ones. At all events, they tapered towards a\n point at the brims, as Simonides of Amorgos says\u2014 \n But this is taper-brimm'd ( \u03c6\u03bf\u03be\u03af\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ), \n that is to say, drawn up to a point towards the top; such as those which\n are called \u1f04\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2. For they use the word \u03c6\u03bf\u03be\u1f78\u03c2 in this sense, as Homer does when speaking of\n Thersites\u2014 \n His head was sharp at top. \n And the word is equivalent to \u03c6\u03b1\u03bf\u03be\u1f78\u03c2, \u2014it\n being perceived to be sharp ( \u1f40\u03be\u1f7a\u03c2 ) in the part\n where the eyes ( \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03ac\u03b7 ) are. \n And very exquisitely wrought \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 are made at\n Naucratis, the native place of our companion Athen\u00e6us. For some are in the form of\n phial\u00e6, not made in a lathe, but formed by hand, and having four handles, and\n being widened considerably towards the bottom: (and there are a great many potters\n at Naucratis, from whom the gate nearest to the potteries ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ) is called the Ceramic gate:) and they are dyed in such a\n manner as to appear like silver. The Chian \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 also are highly extolled, which Hermippus\n mentions in his Soldiers\u2014 \n And a Chian \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be hung on a peg aloft. \n But Glaucon, in his Dialects, says that the inhabitants of Cyprus call\n the cotyle culix. And Hipponax, in his Synonymes, writes thus\u2014 The aleisum,\n the poterium, the cupellum, the amphotis, the scyphus, the culix, the cothon,\n the carchesium, the phiale. And Ach\u00e6us of Eretria, in his Alcm\u00e6on,\n instead of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, has lengthened the word, and\n written \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, in these lines\u2014 \n But it is best to bring, as soon as possible, \n Dark wine, and one large common bowl for all, \n And some \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 besides \n And Alc\u00e6us says\u2014 \n Let us at once sit down and drink our wine, \n Why do we wait for lights? Our day is but \n A finger's span. Bring forth large goblets ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 ) now \n Of various sorts. For the kind liberal son \n Of Jove and Semele gave rosy wine, \n Which bids us all forget our griefs and cares; \n So pour it forth, and mix in due proportion. \n And in his tenth Ode he says\u2014 \n Drops of wine ( \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2 ) fly from Teian\n culichn\u00e6, \n showing, by this expression, that the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 of Teos were exceedingly beautiful. \n ","61":"\n Pherecrates also says, in his Corianno\u2014 \n \n A. For I am coming almost boil'd away \n From the hot bath; my throat is parch'd and dry; \n Give me some wine. I vow my mouth and all \n My jaws are sticky with the heat. \n \n B. Shall I \n Then take the \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7, O damsel, now? \n \n A. By no means, 'tis so small; and all my bile \n Has been stirr'd up since I did drink from it, \n Not long ago, some medicine. Take this cup \n Of mine, 'tis larger, and fill that for me. \n And that the women were in the habit of using large cups, Pherecrates\n himself expressly tells us in his Tyranny, where he says\u2014 \n And then they bade the potter to prepare \n Some goblets for the men, of broader shape, \n Having no walls, but only a foundation, \n And scarcely holding more than a mere shell. \n More like to tasting cups; but for themselves \n \n They order good deep \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \n good-sized, \n Downright wine-carrying transports, wide and round, \n Of delicate substance, swelling in the middle. \n A crafty order: for with prudent foresight \n They were providing how, without much notice, \n They might procure the largest quantity \n Of wine to drink themselves; and then when we \n Reproach them that 'tis they who've drunk up everything, \n They heap abuse on us, and swear that they, \n Poor injured dears, have only drunk one cup, \n Though their one's larger than a thousand common cups. \n \n \n ","62":"\n Then there are cymbia. These are a small hollow kind of cup, according to\n Simaristus. But Dorotheus says, The cymbium is a kind of deep cup, upright,\n having no pedestal and no handles. But Ptolemy the father of\n Aristonicus calls them curved goblets. And Nicander of Thyatira\n says that Theopompus, in his Mede, called a cup without handles cymbium. Philemon,\n in his Vision, says\u2014 \n But when fair Rhode came and shook above you \n A cymbium full of mighty unmix'd wine. \n But Dionysius of Samos, in the sixth book of his treatise on the Cyclic\n Poets, thinks that the \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cd\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd are the same. For he says that Ulysses, having\n filled a cymbium with unmixed wine, gave it to the Cyclops. But the cup mentioned\n in Homer, as having been given to him by Ulysses, is a good-sized cissybium; for\n if it had been a small cup, he, who was so enormous a monster, would not have been\n so quickly overcome by drunkenness, when he had only drunk it three times. And\n Demosthenes mentions the cymbium in his oration against Midias, saying that he was\n accompanied by rhyta and cymbia: and in his orations against Euergus and\n Mnesibulus. But Didymus the grammarian says that is a cup of an oblong shape, and\n narrow in figure, very like the shape of a boat. And Anaxandrides, in his Clowns,\n says\u2014 \n Perhaps large cups ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ) immoderately\n drain'd, \n And cymbia full of strong unmixed wine, \n Have bow'd your heads, and check'd your usual spirit. \n And Alexis, in his Knight, says\u2014 \n \n A. Had then those cymbia the faces of damsels \n Carved on them in pure gold? \n \n B. Indeed they had. \n \n A. Wretched am I, and wholly lost . . . . \n \n \n \n ","63":"\n But Eratosthenes, in his letter addressed to Ageton the Laced\u00e6monian, says, that\n the cymbium is a vessel of the shape of the cyathus, writing thus\u2014 But these\n men marvel how a man who had not got a cyathus, but only a cymbium, had,\n besides that, also a phiale. Now it seems to me, that he had one for the use of\n men, but the other for the purpose of doing honour to the Gods. And at that\n time they never used the cyathus nor the cotyla. For they used to employ, in\n the sacrifices of the Gods, a crater, not made of silver nor inlaid with\n precious stones, but made of Coliad clay. And as often as they replenished\n this, pouring a libation to the Gods out of the phiale, they then poured out\n wine to all the company in order, bailing out the newly-mixed wine in a\n cymbium, as they do now among us at the phiditia. And if ever they wished to\n drink more, they also placed on the table beside them the cups called cotyli,\n which are the most beautiful of all cups, and the most convenient to drink out\n of. And these, too, were all made of the same earthenware. But when\n Ephippus says, in his Ephebi\u2014 \n Ch\u00e6remon brings no culices to supper, \n Nor did Euripides with cymbia fight, \n he does not mean the tragic poet, but some namesake of his, who was\n either very fond of wine, or who had an evil reputation on some other account, as\n Antiochus of Alexandria says, in his treatise on the Poets, who are ridiculed by\n the comic writers of the Middle Comedy. For the circumstance of cymbia being\n introduced into entertainments, and being used to fight with in drunken quarrels,\n bears on each point. And Anaxandrides mentions him in his Nereids\u2014 \n Give him a choeus then of wine, O messmate, \n And let him bring his cymbium, and be \n A second Euripides to-day. \n And Ephippus, in his Similitudes, or Obeliaphori, says\u2014 \n But it were well to learn the plays of Bacchus, \n And all the verses which Demophoon \n Made upon Cotys; and, at supper-time, \n To spout the eclogues of the wise Theorus. \n * * * * * * \n And let Euripides, that banquet-hunter, \n Bring me his cymbia. \n And that the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7 is the name of a boat\n too we are shown by Sophocles, who, in his Andromeda, says\u2014 \n Come you on horseback hither, or in a boat ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9 )? \n \n And Apollodorus, in his Paphians, says there is a kind of\n drinking-cup called \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1. \n \n ","64":"\n Then there is the \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. Now, is this the same\n as the \u1f04\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd and the \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2, and different from them only in name \n Then rising, all with goblets ( \u03ba\u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 ) in\n their hands, \n The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands \n Hail'd their return. \n Or was their form different also? For this kind has not the character of\n the amphicupellum, as the depas and aleison have, but is only of a curved form.\n For the \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd is so called from its curved\n shape, as also is the \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd. Or is it so\n called as being in shape like a milk-pail ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 ),\n only contracted a little, so as to have an additional curve? And the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 is equivalent to \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1, being so called from its handles, because they are of a\n curved shape. For the poet calls this cup\u2014 \n Golden, two-handled. \n But Antimachus, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says\u2014 \n And heralds, going round among the chiefs, \n Gave each a golden cup ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) with\n labour wrought. \n And Silenus says, the \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 are a kind\n of cup resembling the \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b1, as Nicander the\n Colophonian says\u2014 \n The swineherd gave a goblet ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) full\n to each. \n And Eumolpus says that it is a kind of cup, so called from its being of a\n curved shape ( \u03ba\u03c5\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd. ) But Simaristus says that\n this is a name given by the Cyprians to a cup with two handles, and by the Cretans\n to a kind of cup with two handles, and to another with four. And Philetas says\n that the Syracusans give the name of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd to\n the fragments of barley-cakes and loaves which are left on the tables. \n There is also the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b7. Philemon, in his Attic\n Dialect, calls it a species of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. \n And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Etymologies, says, that the Paphians\n call a drinking-cup \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1. \n \n ","65":"\n Then there is the \u03ba\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd, which is mentioned by\n Xenophon, in the first book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia. But Critias, in his Constitution of\n the Laced\u00e6monians, writes as follows\u2014 And other small things besides which\n belong to human life; such as the Laced\u00e6monian shoes, which are the best, and\n the Laced\u00e6monian garments, which are the most pleasant to wear, and the most\n useful. There is also the Laced\u00e6monian \n \u03ba\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd, which is a kind of drinking-cup most\n convenient when one is on an expedition, and the most easily carried in a\n knapsack. And the reason why it is so peculiarly well-suited to a soldier is,\n because a soldier often is forced to drink water which is not very clean; and,\n in the first place, this cup is not one in which it can be very easily seen\n what one is drinking; and, secondly, as its brim is rather curved inwards, it\n is likely to retain what is not quite clean in it. And Polemo, in his\n work addressed to Ad\u00e6us and Antigonus, says that the Laced\u00e6monians used to use\n vessels made of earthenware; and proceeds to say further\u2014 And this was a\n very common practice among the ancients, such as is now adopted in some of the\n Greek tribes. At Argos, for instance, in the public banquets, and in Laced\u00e6mon,\n they drink out of cups made of earthenware at the festivals, and in the feasts\n in honour of victory, and at the marriage-feasts of their maidens. But at other\n banquets and at their Phiditia they use small\n casks. And Archilochus also mentions the cothon as a kind of cup, in\n his Elegies, where he says\u2014 \n But come now, with your cothon in your hand, \n Move o'er the benches of the speedy ship, \n And lift the covers from the hollow casks, \n And drain the rosy wine down to the dregs; \n For while we're keeping such a guard as this, \n We shan't be able to forego our wine; \n as if the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be were here called \u03ba\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd. Aristophanes, in his Knights, says\u2014 \n They leapt into th' horse-transports gallantly, \n Buying cothones; but some bought instead \n Garlic and onions. \n And Heniochus, in his Gorgons, says\u2014 \n Let a man give me wine to drink at once, \n Taking that capital servant of the throat, \n The ample cothon\u2014fire-wrought, and round, \n Broad-ear'd, wide-mouth'd. \n And Theopompus, in his Female Soldiers, says\u2014 \n Shall I, then, drink from out a wryneck'd cothon, \n Breaking my own neck in the hard attempt? \n \n And Alexis, in his Spinners, says\u2014 \n And then he hurl'd a four-pint cothon at me, \n An ancient piece of plate, an heirloom too. \n And it is from this cup that they call those who drink a great deal of\n unmixed wine ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ) as Hyperides does in his\n oration against Demosthenes. But Callixenus, in the fourth book of his History of\n Alexandria, giving an account of the procession of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and\n giving a catalogue of a number of drinking-cups, adds these words: And two\n cothons, each holding two measures of wine. \n \n ","66":"\n But with respect to drinking, (which from the name of this kind of cup is\n sometimes called in the verb \u03ba\u03c9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03af- \n \u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, and in the substantive \u03ba\u03c9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2, that occasional drinking is good for the\n health is stated by Mnesitheus the Athenian physician, in his letter on the\n subject of Drinking ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 ), where he speaks\n as follows: It happens that those who drink a great quantity of unmixed\n wine at banquets often receive great injury from so doing, both in their bodies\n and minds; but still occasional hard drinking ( \u03ba\u03c9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9- \n \u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) for some days appears to me to produce\n a certain purging of the body and a certain relaxation of the mind. For there\n are some little roughnesses on the surface, arising from daily banquets; now\n for getting rid of these there is no easier channel than the wine. But of all\n modes of purging, that which' is caused by hard drinking is the most\n advantageous; for then the body is as it were washed out by the wine; for the\n wine is both liquid and heating: but the wine which we secrete is harsh;\n accordingly, fullers use it as a cleanser when they are cleaning garments. But\n when you are drinking hard, you should guard against three things,\u2014 against\n drinking bad wine, against drinking unmixed wine, and against eating sweetmeats\n while you are drinking. And when you have had enough, then do not go to sleep,\n until you have had a vomit, moderate or copious as the case may be; and when\n you have vomited, then go to sleep after having taken a slight bath. And if you\n are not able to empty yourself sufficiently, then you must take a more copious\n bath, and lie down in the bath in exceedingly warm water. But Polemo,\n in the fifth book of his treatise addressed to Antigonus and Ad\u00e6us,\n says\u2014 Bacchus being full grown, sitting on a rock,\n and on his left hand a satyr, bald, holding in his right hand a cothon of\n striped colours, with one handle. \n \n ","67":"\n There is also the labronia. This is a species of Persian drinking-cup, so named\n from the eagerness ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ) with which people\n drink: and its shape is wide, and its size large, and it has large handles.\n Menander, in his Fisherman, says\u2014 \n We are abundantly well off at this time \n For golden cylinders; and all those robes \n From Persia, all those quaintly carved works, \n Are now within, and richly-chased goblets, \n Figures and faces variously carved, \n Tragelaphi and labronia. \n And in his Philadelphi he says\u2014 \n And now the drinking of healths began, and now \n Labroni\u00e6, inlaid with precious stones, \n Were set upon the board; and slaves stood round \n With Persian fly-flappers. \n And Hipparchus, in his Thais, says\u2014 But this labronius is an omen now. O\n Hercules! it is a cup which weighs Of standard gold more than two hundred pieces.\n Just think, my friend, of this superb labronius. And Diphilus, in his Pithraustes,\n giving a catalogue of other kinds of cups, says\u2014 \n \n A. The tragelaphus, and likewise the pristis, \n The batiace, and labronius too. \n \n B. These seem to me to be the names of slaves. \n \n A. By no means; they are all the names of cups; \n And this lambronius is worth twenty pieces. \n And Didymus says that it resembles the bombylium and the batiacium. \n ","68":"\n There is also the lac\u00e6na. And this is a kind of cup so called either from the\n potter, as the Attic vessels, usually are, or from the form which is usual in that\n district, on the same principle as the thericlean cups derive their name. \n Aristophanes, in his Daitaleis, says\u2014 \n He gladly shared the Sybaritic feasts, \n And drank the Chian wine from out the cups \n Called the lacecn\u00e6, with a cheerful look. \n \n \n ","69":"\n Then there is the lepaste. Some mark this word \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 with an acute accent on the last syllable, like \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae; but some mark the penultima with an acute, as\n \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7. And this kind of cup derived its name\n from those who spend a great deal of money on their drinking\n and intemperance, whom men call \u03bb\u03ac\u03c6\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. \n Aristophanes, in his Peace, says\u2014 \n What will you do, then, when you've drunk \n One single lepaste full of new wine? \n And it is from this word \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u1f74 that the\n verb \u03bb\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 comes, which means to swallow all at\n once, having a meaning just opposite to the bombylium; for the same author says,\n somewhere or other,\u2014 \n You've drunk up all my blood, O king, my master! \n which is as much as to say, you have utterly drained me. And in his\n Gerytades he says\u2014 \n But there was then a festival: a slave \n Went round, and brought us all a lepaste, \n And pour'd in wine dark as the deep-blue sea; \n but the poet means here to indicate the depth of the cup. \n And Antiphanes, in his Aesculapius, says\u2014 \n He took an ag\u00e8d woman, who had been \n A long time ill, sick of a ling'ring fever, \n And bruising some small root, and putting it \n Into a noble-sized lepaste there, \n He made her drink it all, to cure her sickness. \n Philyllius, in his Auge, says\u2014 \n For she was always in the company \n Of young men, who did nothing else but drink; \n And with a lot of aged women too, \n Who always do delight in good-sized cups. \n And Theopompus says in his Pamphila\u2014 \n A sponge, a dish, a feather; and, besides, \n A stout lepaste, which, when full, they drain \n To the Good Deity, raising loud his praises, \n As chirps a grasshopper upon a tree. \n And in his Mede he says\u2014 \n Callimachus, 'tis stated, once did charm \n The Grecian heroes by some promised gain, \n When he was seeking for their aid and friendship. \n The only thing he fail'd in was th' attempt \n To gain the poor, thin-bodied Rhadamanthus \n Lysander with a cothon, ere he gave him \n A full lepaste. \n But Amerias says that the ladle with which the wine is poured into the\n cups is called lepaste; but Aristophanes and Apollodorus say that it is a sort of\n cup of the class \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. Pherecrates, in his\n Crapatalli, says\u2014 \n \n If there was one of the spectators thirsty, \n He would a full lepaste seize, and drain \n The whole contents. \n But Nicander the Colophonian says that \"the Dolopans give the name of\n \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u1f74 to the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be; but Lycophron, in the ninth book of his treatise on Comedy,\n quoting this passage of Pherecrates, himself also asserts the lepaste to be kind\n of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be; but Moschus, in his Interpretation of\n Rhodiat Words, says that it is an earthenware vessel resembling those which are\n called ptomatides, but flatter and wider: but Artemidorus, the pupil of\n Aristophanes, says that it is some sort of drinking-cup. And Apollophanes, in his\n Cretans, says\u2014 \n And the lepasta, fill'd with fragrant wine, \n Shall fill me with delight the livelong day. \n And Theopompus says in his Pamphila\u2014 \n A stout lepaste, which, well-fill'd with wine, \n They drain in honour of the Happy Deity, \n Rousing the village with their noise and clamour. \n But Nicander of Thyatira says it is a larger kind of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be, quoting the expressions of Teleclides out of his\n Prytanes\u2014 \n To drink sweet wine from a sweet-smelling lepaste. \n And Hermippus, in his Fates, says\u2014 \n If anything should happen to me when \n I've drain'd this promising lepaste, then \n I give my whole possessions unto Bacchus. \n \n \n ","70":"\n There is also the loibasium. This, too, is a \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be, as Clearchus and Nicander of Thyatira say; with which they\n pour libations of oil over the sacred offerings and victims. \n Spondeum is the name given to the cup out of which they pour libations of wine.\n And he says that the spondea are also called loibides, by Antimachus of\n Colophon. \n Then we have the lesbium. This also is a kind of cup, as Hedylus proves in his\n Epigrams, where he says\u2014 \n Callistion, contending against men \n In drinking, ('tis a marvellous thing, but true,) \n When fasting, drank three whole choeis of wine; \n And now her cup, fashion'd of purple glass, \n Adorn'd with bands fragrant of luscious wine, \n She offers here to you, O Paphian queen. \n Preserve this first, that so your walls may bear \n The spoils of all the love excited so. \n \n \n There is also the luterium. Epigenes, in his Tomb, where he gives a catalogue of\n cups of different kinds, says\u2014 \n \n Craters, cadi, holcia, cruneia\u2014 \n Are they cruneia? aye, and luteria. \n But why need I each separate article \n Enumerate? for you yourself shall see them. \n \n \n ","71":"\n There is also the Lyciurges. The things which are so called are some kinds of\n phial\u00e6, which derive their name from Lycon who made them, just as the Cononii are\n the cups made by Conon. Now, Demosthenes, in his Oration for the Crown, mentions\n Lycon; and he does so again, in his oration against Timotheus for an assault,\n where he says\u2014 Two lyciurgeis Phial\u00e6. And in his speech against\n Timotheus he also says \u2014 He gives Phormion, with the money, also two\n lyciurgeis Phial\u00e6 to put away. And Didymus the grammarian says that\n these are cups made by Lycius. And this Lycius was a B\u0153otian by birth, of the town\n of Eleuther\u00e6, a son of Myron the sculptor, as Polemo relates in the first book of\n his treatise on the Acropolis of Athens; but the grammarian is ignorant that one\n could never find such a formation of a word as that derived from proper names, but\n only from cities or nations. For Aristophanes, in his Peace, says\u2014 \n The vessel is a \u03bd\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c1\u03b3\u1f74\u03c2 cantharus; \n that is to say, made at Naxos. \n And Critias, in his Constitution of the Laced\u00e6monians, has the expressions,\n \u03ba\u03bb\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f74\u03c2, and again, \u03b4\u03af\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \n \u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2 : and \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74\n \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f74\u03c2, and \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2 :\n made at Miletus, or Chios, or Rhenea. And Herodotus, in his seventh book, speaks\n of two spears, \u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2. \n But perhaps we ought to read \u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2 \n in Herodotus as we do in Demosthenes, so as to understand by the word things made\n in Lycia. \n ","72":"\n There is also the mele. This is a name given to some cups which are mentioned by\n Anaxippus in his Well, where he says\u2014 \n And you, Syriscus, now this mele take, \n And bring it to her tomb\u2014do you understand \n Then pour a due libation. \n \n \n There is also the metaniptrum. This is the kind of cup which is offered after\n dinner, when men have washed their hands. Autiphanes, in his Lamp, says\u2014 \n The metaniptrum of the Fortunate God; \n Feasting, libations, and applause . . . \n \n And Diphilus, in his Sappho, says\u2014 \n Archilochus, receive this metaniptris, \n The brimming cup of Jupiter the Saviour. \n \n \n But some people say that this is rather the name of the draught itself which was\n given to the guests after they had washed their hands; as, for instance, Seleucus\n says in his Dialects. But Callias, in his Cyclops, says\u2014 \n Receive this metaniptris of Hygeia. \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Aesculapius, says\u2014 \n He raised aloft a mighty metaniptris, \n Brimfull of wine, in equal portions mix'd, \n Repeating all the tine Hygeia's name. \n And Philoxenus the Dithyrambic poet, in his ode entitled the Supper,\n pledging some one after they have washed their hands, says\u2014 \n Do you, my friend, receive \n This metaniptris full of wine, \n The sweetly dewy gift of Bacchus. \n Bromius gives this placid joy, \n To lead all men to happiness. \n And Antiphanes, in his Torch, says\u2014 \n Our table shall now be this barley cake, \n And then this metaniptrum of Good Fortune . . . . . \n Nicostratus, in his Woman returning Love, says\u2014 \n Pour over him the metaniptrum of health. \n \n \n ","73":"\n Then there is the mastus. Apollodorus the Cyren\u00e6an, as Pamphilus says, states that\n this is a name given to drinking-cups by the Paphians. \n There are also the mathalides. Bl\u00e6sus, in his Saturn, says\u2014 \n Pour out for us now seven mathalides \n Full of sweet wine. \n And Pamphilus says, Perhaps this is a kind of cup, or is it only a\n measure like the cyathus But Diodorus calls it a cup of the \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be class. \n ","74":"\n There is also the manes, which is a species of cup. Nicon, in his Harp-player,\n says\u2014 \n And some seasonably then exclaim'd, \n My fellow-countryman, I drink to you; \n And in his hand he held an earthenware manes, \n Of ample size, well able to contain \n Five cotyl\u00e6 of wine; and I received it. \n And both Didymus and Pamphilus have quoted these iambics. But that is also called manes which stands upon the cottabus,\n on which they throw the drops of wine in that game, which Sophocles, in his\n Salmoneus, called the brazen head, saying\u2014 \n This is a contest, and a noise of kisses; \n I give a prize to him who gains the victory \n In elegantly throwing the cottabus, \n And striking with just aim the brazen head. \n And Antiphanes, in his Birthday of Venus, says\u2014 \n \n A. I then will show you how: whoever throws \n The cottabus direct against the scale ( \u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03be, ) \n So as to make it fall\u2014 \n \n B. What scale? Do you \n Mean this small dish which here is placed above? \n \n A. That is the scale-he is the conqueror. \n \n B. How shall a man know this? \n \n A. Why, if he throw \n So as to reach it barely, it will fall \n Upon the manes, and there'll be great noise. \n \n B. Does manes, then, watch o'er the cottabus, \n As if he were a slave? \n And Hermippus says in his Fates\u2014 \n You'll see, says he, a cottabus rod. \n Wallowing round among the chaff; \n But the manes hears no drops,\u2014 \n And you the wretched scale may see \n Lying by the garden gate, \n And thrown away among the rubbish. \n \n \n ","75":"\n There is the Nestoris also. Now concerning the shape of the cup of Nestor, the\n poet speaks thus\u2014 \n Next her white hand a spacious goblet brings, \n A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings \n From eldest times; the massy, sculptured vase, \n Glittering with golden studs, four handles grace, \n And curling vines, around each handle roll'd, \n Support two turtle-doves emboss'd in gold. \n On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl, \n Lest the top weight should make it loosely roll: \n A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him, \n Though all too great for men of lesser limb. \n Now with reference to this passage a question is raised, what is the\n meaning of glittering with golden studs: \u2014and again, what is meant\n by the massy, sculptured vase four handles grace. For Asclepiades\n the Myrlean, in his treatise on the Nestoris, says that the other cups have two\n handles. And again, how could any one give a representation\n of turtle- doves feeding around each of the handles? How also can he say,\n On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl? And this also is a very\n peculiar statement that he makes, that he could heave it with ease, though\n all too great for men of lesser limb. Now Asclepiades proposes all\n these difficulties, and especially raises the question about the studs, as to how\n we are to understand that they were fastened on. Now some say that golden studs\n must be fastened on a silver goblet from the outside, on the principles of\n embossing, as is mentioned in the case of the sceptre of Achilles\u2014 \n He spoke,\u2014and, furious, hurl'd against the ground \n His sceptre, starr'd with golden studs around; \n for it is plain here that the studs were let into the sceptre, as clubs\n are strengthened with iron nails. He also says of the sword of Agamemnon\u2014 \n A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied, \n Sustain'd the sword that glittered at his side: \n Gold were the studs\u2014a silver sheath encased \n The shining blade. \n \n \n But Apelles the engraver, he says, showed us on some articles of Corinthian\n workmanship the way in which studs were put on. For there was a small projection\n raised up by the chisel, to form, as it were, the heads of the nails. And these\n studs are said by the poet to be fixed in, not because they are on the outside and\n are fixed by nails, but because they resemble nails driven through, and project a\n little on the outside, being above the rest of the surface. \n ","76":"\n And with respect to the handles, they tell us that this cup had indeed two handles\n above, like other cups; but that it had also two more on the middle of its convex\n surface, one on each side, of small size, resembling the Corinthia water- ewers.\n But Apelles explained the system of the four handles very artistically in the\n following manner. He said, tat from one root, as it were, which is attached to the\n bottom of the cup, there are diverging lines extending along each handle, at no\n great distance from each other: and these reach up to the brim of the cup, and\n even rise a little above it, and are at the greatest distance from each other at\n the point where they are furthest from the vessel itself; but at the lower\n extremity, where they join the rim, they are again united. And in this way there are four handles; but this kind of ornament is not\n seen in every cup, but only on some, and especially on those which are called\n seleucides. But with respect to the question raised about the two bases, how it\n can be said, On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl, some people\n explain that line thus:\u2014that some cups have one bottom, the natural one, being\n wrought at the same time as, and of one piece with, the whole cup; as for\n instance, those which are called cymbia, and the phial\u00e6, and others of the same\n shape as the phial\u00e6. But some have two bottoms; as for instance, the egg-shaped\n cups called ooscyphia, and those called cantharia, and the seleucides, and the\n carchesia, and others of this kind. For they say that one of these bottoms is\n wrought of the same piece as the entire cup, and the other is attached to it,\n being sharp at the upper part, and broader towards the lower end, as a support for\n the cup; and this cup of Nestor's, they say, was of this fashion. But the poet may\n have represented this cup as having two bottoms; the one, that is to say, bearing\n the whole weight of the cup, and having an elevation proportionate to the height,\n in accordance, with its greater circumference; and the other bottom might be\n smaller in circumference, so as to be contained within the circumference of the\n larger circle, where the natural bottom of the cup becomes sharper; so that the\n whole cup should be supported on two bases. \n But Dionysius the Thracian is said to have made the cup called Nestor's, at\n Rhodes, all his pupils contributing silver for the work; of which Promethidas of\n Heraclea, explaining the way in which it was made on the system of Dionysius, says\n that it is a cup having its handles made side by side, as the ships with two prows\n have their prows made; and that turtle-doves are represented sitting on the\n handles; and that two small sticks, as it were, are placed under the cup as a\n support to it, running transversely across in a longitudinal direction, and that\n these are the two bottoms meant by Homer. And we may to this day see a cup of that\n fashion at Capua, a city of Campania, consecrated to Diana; and the Capuans assert\n that that is the identical cup which belonged to Nestor. And it is a silver cup,\n having on it the lines of Homer engraved in golden characters. \n ","77":"\n \n But I, said the Myrlean, \"have this to say about the cup:\u2014the ancients, who first brought men over to a more civilized system of\n life, believing that the world was spherical, and taking their ideas of form from\n the visible forms of the sun and moon which they beheld, and adapting these\n figures to their own use in the daily concerns of life, thought it right to make\n all their vessels and other articles of furniture resemble, in shape at least, the\n heaven which surrounds everything: on which account they made tables round; and so\n also they made the tripods which they dedicated to the Gods, and they also made\n their cakes round and marked with stars, which they also call moons. And this is\n the origin of their giving bread the name of \u1f04\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, because of all figures the circle is the one which is the\n most complete ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ), and it is a perfect\n figure. And accordingly they made a drinking-cup, being that which receives moist\n nourishment, circular, in imitation of the shape of the world. But the cup of\n Nestor has something peculiar about it, for it has stars on it, which the poet\n compares to studs, because the stars are as round as the studs, and are, as it\n were, fixed in the heaven; as also Aratus says of them\u2014 \n There do they shine in heaven,\u2014ornaments \n Fix'd there for ever as the night comes round. \n But the poet has expressed this very beautifully, attaching the golden\n studs to the main body of the silver cup, and so indicating the nature of the\n stars and of the heaven by the colour of the ornaments. For the heaven is like\n silver, and the stars resemble gold from their fiery colour. \n ","78":"\n \"So after the poet had represented the cup of Nestor as studded with stars, he\n then proceeds on to the most brilliant of the fixed stars, by contemplating which\n men form their conjectures of what is to happen to them in their lives. I mean the\n Pleiades. For when he says \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 were\n placed in gold around each handle, he does not mean the birds called \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, that is to say, turtle-doves; and those who\n think that he does use \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 here as\n synonymous with \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 are wrong. For\n Aristotle says expressly that the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 is one\n bird, and the \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 another. But the poet\n calls that constellation \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 which at\n present w call \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2; by the rising of which\n men regulate their swing and their reaping, and the beginning of their raising\n their crops, and their collection of them; as Hesiod says:\u2014 \n \n When the seven daughters of the Libyan king \n Rise in the heavens, then begin to mow; \n And when they hide their heads, then plough the ground. \n And Aratus says\u2014 \n Their size is small, their light but moderate, \n Yet are they famous over all the world; \n At early dawn and late at eve they roll, \n Jove regulating all their tranquil motions; \n He has ordain'd them to give signs to men, \n When winter, and when summer too begins,\u2014 \n What is the time for ploughing, what for sowing. \n And accordingly it is with great appropriateness that the poet has\n represented the Pleiades, who indicate the time of the generation and approach to\n perfection of the fruits of the earth, as forming parts of the ornaments of the\n cup of that wise prince Nestor. For this vessel was intended to contain any kind\n of food, whether solid or liquid; on which account he also says that the\n turtle-doves bring ambrosia to Jupiter:\u2014 \n No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing, \n That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king, \n But shuns these rocks. \n For we must not think here that it is really the birds called\n turtle-doves which bring ambrosia to Jupiter, which is the opinion of many; for\n that were inconsistent with the majesty of Jupiter; but the daughters of Atlas,\n turned into the constellation of Pleiades or doves. For it is natural enough that\n they who indicate the appropriate seasons to the human race should also bring\n ambrosia to Jupiter, on which account also he distinguishes between them and other\n birds, saying\u2014 \n No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing; \n and that he considers the Pleiades as the most famous of all fixed stars\n is plain, from his having placed them in the first rank when giving a list of\n other constellations:\u2014 \n There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd,\u2014 \n Th' unwearied sun, the moon completely round,\u2014 \n The starry lights, that heaven's high convex crown'd,\u2014 \n The Pleiads, Hyads, with the Northern Team, \n And great Orion's more refulgent beam; \n To which, around the axle of the sky, \n The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye; \n Still shines exalted on th' ethereal plain, \n Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main,\u2014 \n The Bear, whom trusting rustics call the Wain. \n \n \n \n \"But people in general have been deceived by fancying the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 here spoken of to be birds, first of all from the poetical\n form of the word, because of the insertion of the letter \u03b5; and secondly, because they have taken the word \u03c4\u03c1\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, 'trembling,' as an epithet only of doves;\n since, owing to its weakness, that is a very cautious bird; and when he calls it\n \u03c4\u03c1\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, this word is derived from \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9, and \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 is the\n same as \u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to be cautious. But still\n there is a good deal of reason in attributing the same characteristic also to the\n Pleiades: for the fable is, that they are always fleeing from Orion, since their\n mother Pleione is constantly pursued by Orion. \n ","79":"\n \"And the variation of the name, so that the Pleiades are called both \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 and \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n occurs in many poets. First of all, Myro the Byzantian admirably caught the\n feeling of the Homeric poems, saying in her poem entitled Memory, that the\n Pleiades convey ambrosia to Jupiter. But Crates the critic, endeavouring to\n appropriate to himself the credit due to her, produces that assertion as his own.\n Simonides also has called the Pleiades \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n in the following lines:\u2014 \n And may great Mercury, whose protecting pow'r \n Watches o'er contests, Maia's mighty son, \n Grant you success. But Atlas was the sire \n Of seven dark-hair'd daughters, beautiful, \n Surpassing all the maidens upon earth, \n And now in heaven they're call'd Peleiades. \n Here he distinctly calls the Pleiades \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, for they it was who were the daughters of Atlas; as\n Pindar says\u2014 \n And it is natural \n That great Oarion should advance \n Not far from the seven Pleiades, at the tail ( \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ). \n For, in the arrangement of the stars, Orion is not far from the Pleiades;\n from which circumstance has arise the fable about them, that they, with their\n mother Pleione, are always fleeing from Orion. But when he calls the Pleiades\n \u1f44\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 here, he means \u03bf\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, only he has left out the v, because\n the Pleiades are close to the tail of the Bull. And Aechylus has spoken still more\n plainly, playing on their name on account of the resemblance of its sound, where\n he says\u2014 \n The seven celebrated daughters of \n The mighty Atlas, much bewail'd with tears \n \n Their father's heaven-supporting toil; where they \n Now take the form of night-appearing visions, \n The wingless Peleiades. \n For he calls them here wingless on account of the similarity of the sound\n of their name to that of the birds \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 And\n Myro herself also speaks in the same manner\u2014 \n The mighty Jove was nourished long in Crete, \n Nor yet had any of the heav'nly beings \n E'er recognised their king; meanwhile he grew \n In all his limbs; and him the trembling doves \n Cherish'd, while hidden in the holy cave, \n Bringing him, from the distant streams of ocean, \n Divine ambrosia: and a mighty eagle, \n Incessant drawing with his curved beak \n Nectar from out the rock, triumphant brought \n The son of Saturn's necessary drink. \n Him, when the God of mighty voice had cast \n His father Saturn from his unjust throne, \n He made immortal, and in heaven placed. \n And so, too, did he give the trembling doves ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd ) \n Deserved honour; they who are to men \n Winter's and summer's surest harbingers. \n And Simmias, in his Gorge, says\u2014 \n The swiftest ministers of air came near, \n The quivering peleiades. \n And Posidippus, in his Asopia, says\u2014 \n Nor do the evening cool \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 set. \n But Lamprocles the Dithyrambic poet has also expressly and poetically\n said that the word \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 is in every sense\n synonymous with \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76, in the following\n lines\u2014 \n And now you have your home in heaven, \n Showing your title with the winged doves. \n And the author of the poem called Astronomy, which is attributed to\n Hesiod, always calls the Pleiades \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n saying\u2014 \n Which mortals call Peleiades. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n And now the Peleiades of winter set. \n And in another passage we find\u2014 \n Then the Peleiades do hide their heads; \n so that there is nothing at all improbable in the idea of Homer having\n lengthened the name \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 by poetic licence\n into \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n ","80":"\n \"Since, then, it is demonstrated that it is the Pleiades who\n were embossed on the goblet, we must understand that two were affixed to each\n handle, whether we choose to fancy that the damsels were represented under the\n form of birds or under human form;\u2014at all events they were studded with stars: and\n as for the expression, Around each there were golden peleiades, we\n are not to understand that as meaning around each separate one; for that would\n make eight in number: but as each of the handles was divided into two sections,\n and as these again were united towards the bottom, the poet has used the word\n \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, speaking as if there were four\n sections of handles; but if he had said \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \n that would have applied to the fact of their again becoming united at the highest\n point which they respectively reach. And accordingly, when he says\u2014 \n And curling vines, around each handle roll'd, \n Bear two Peleiades emboss'd in gold; \n On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl; \n we are by that to understand one Peleias to. each section of the handles.\n And he has called them \u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2, as being united to\n one another and grown together as it were. For the word \u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u1f76 , signifies simply the number two, as in the passage\u2014 \n Two tripods ( \u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 ), and ten\n golden talents; \n and again\u2014 \n Two attendants ( \u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ): \n and it also at times intimates a natural connexion subsisting between the\n two things spoken of, as well as that they are two in number; as in these lines:\u2014\n \n There grew two ( \u03b4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1f76 ) olives, closest of\n the grove, \n With roots entwined and branches interwove, \n Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled \n With sister fruits,\u2014one fertile, one was wild:\u2014 \n and accordingly this calculation will give altogether four Peleiades upon\n the handles. \n ","81":"\n \"And, then, when he adds this\u2014 \n And curling vines, around each handle roll'd, \n Bear two Peleiades emboss'd in gold: \n On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl; \n we are to understand not two actual separate bases, nor indeed ought we\n to read \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 as two words, like Dionysius\n the Thracian, but we ought to read it as one word, \n \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, in order to understand it with\n reference to the Peleiades, that there were four Peleiades on the handles, and two\n more \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, which is equivalent to \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9, that is to say, under the pedestal, as\n if the word were \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03b8- \n \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9. So that the goblet is supported by two\n Peleiades which lie under the bottom, and in that way there are altogether six\n Pleiades in all, since that is the number which are seen, though they are said to\n be seven in number, as Aratus says\u2014 \n They are indeed declared by mortal man \n To be in number seven; yet no more \n Than six have e'er been seen by mortal eyes. \n Not that a star can e'er have disappear'd \n Unnoticed from the pure expanse of heaven \n Since we have heard of its existence; but \n The number has been stated carelessly, \n And therefore they are usually call'd seven. \n Accordingly, what is seen in the stars the poet has very suitably\n described among the ornaments made on the occasion. And many fancy that the poet\n is here referring to Jupiter, when he says\u2014 \n No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing, \n That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king, \n But shuns these rocks. In vain she cuts the skies, \n They fearful meet, and crush her as she flies. \n Meaning in reality, that one of the Pleiades was destroyed by the\n sharpness of the rocks and their smooth edge, and that another is substituted in\n her place by Jupiter for the sake of keeping the number undiminished. Expressing\n by the enigmatical figures of speech common to poets, that, though there are only\n six Pleiades seen, still their real number is not actually diminished; but there\n are said to be seven in number, and also the names of the seven are distinctly\n given. \n ","82":"\n But as for those people who contend that there is no appropriateness in embossing\n the Pleiades on this cup, as they are rather indicative of dry food, we must state\n that this kind of cup is calculated to receive both solid and liquid food; for\n \u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u1f7c\u03bd \n is\n made in it; and this is a kind of potion, having mixed in it cheese and meal; and\n the poet tells us that both these ingredients are stirred up\n ( \u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 ) together and so drunk:\u2014 \n The draught prescribed fair Hecamede prepares, \n Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs \n (Whom to his aged arms a royal slave \n Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom, gave): \n A table first with azure feet she placed, \n Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced; \n Honey, new press'd, the sacred flour of wheat, \n And wholesome garlic crown'd the savoury treat \n Next her white hand a spacious goblet brings, \n A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings; \n Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine \n Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine; \n With goats'-milk cheese a flavorous taste bestows, \n And last with flour the smiling surface strows. \n This for the wounded prince the dame prepares; \n The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares. \n \n \n ","83":"\n And as for the lines\u2014 \n A massy weight, yet heav'd with ease by him, \n Though all too great for men of smaller limb; \n we are not to understand this as referring only to Machaon and Nestor, as\n some people think, who refer \u1f43\u03c2 to Machaon, taking\n it as if it were \u1f41, and say, \n \n \u02bc\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u02bc \u03b4\u0313\u03c2 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03b6\u03b7\u03c2,\u2014 \n \n thinking that heaved with ease by him is said of Machaon,\n as he was the person for whom the cup has been mixed as he had been wounded; but\n we shall show hereafter that Machaon is never represented in Homer as wounded. But\n these men do not perceive, that when Homer says \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, he is not speaking of Machaon and Nestor alone (for these two\n are drinking of the cup), for in that case he would have said \u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2.

But Ptolemy Philadelphus the king jested upon him with some wit, on\n account of this and other much talked-of solutions. For as Sosibius received a\n royal stipend, Ptolemy, sending for his treasurers, desired them, when Sosibius\n came to demand his stipend, to tell him that he had received it already. And\n when, not long after, he did come and ask for his money, they said they had\n given it to him already, and said no more. But he, going to the king, accused the treasurers. And Ptolemy sent for them, and\n ordered them to come with their books, in which were the lists of those who\n received those stipends. And when they had arrived, the king took the books\n into his hands and looking into them himself, also asserted that Sosibius had\n received his money; making it out in this way:\u2014These names were set\n down,\u2014Soter, Sosigenes, Bion, Apollon, Dion; and the king, looking on these\n names, said\u2014My excellent solver of difficulties, if you take \u03c3\u03c9 from \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1, and\n \u03c3\u03b9 from \u03c3\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, and the first syllable \u03b2\u03b9 from \u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03bd and the last\n syllable from \u02bc\u03b1\u02bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, you will find, on\n your own principles, that you have received your stipend. And you are caught in\n this way, not owing to the actions of others, but by your own feathers, as the\n incomparable Aeschylus says, since you yourself are always occupied about\n solutions of difficulties which are foreign to the subject in hand. \n \n ","85":"\n There is the holmus also. This, too, is a drinking-cup, made in the fashion of a\n horn. Menesthenes, in the fourth book of his Politics, writes thus\u2014 A\n twisted albatanes and a golden holmus. But the holmus is a cup wrought after\n the fashion of a horn, about a cubit in height. \n \n ","86":"\n There is also the oxybaphum. Now common usage gives this name to the cruet that\n holds the vinegar; but it is also the name of a cup; and it is mentioned by\n Cratinus, in his Putina, in this way:\u2014 \n How can a man now make him leave off this \n Excessive drinking? I can tell a way; \n For I will break his jugs and measures all, \n And crush his casks as with a thunderbolt, \n And all his other vessels which serve to drink: \n Nor shall he have a single oxybaphum left, \n Fit to hold wine. \n But that the oxybaphum is a kind of small \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be, made of earthenware, Antiphanes proves plainly enough, in his\n Mystis, in the following words. There is a wine-bibbing old woman praising a large\n cup, and disparaging the oxybaphum as small. So when some one says to her\u2014 \n Do you, then, drink; \n she answers\u2014 \n There I will obey you. \n And, by the gods, the figure of the cup \n Is quite inviting, worthy of the fame \n Of this high festival; for have we not\u2014 \n Have we not, and not long ago, I say, \n Drunk out of earthenware oxybapha? \n But may the gods, my son, give many blessings \n To him who made this cup-a noble cup, \n As to its beauty and its good capacity. \n And also in the Babylonians of Aristophanes we hear of the oxybaphum as a\n drinking-cup, when Bacchus speaks of the demagogues at Athens, saying that they\n demanded of him two oxybapha when he was going away to trial. For we cannot think\n that they asked him for anything but cups. And the oxybaphum, which is put before\n the people who play at the cottabus, into which they pour their drops of wine, can\n be nothing else but a flat cup. Eubulus also, in his Mylothris, mentions the\n oxybaphum as a cup\u2014 \n And besides, I measure out for drinking \n An oxybaphum all round; and then he swore \n The wine was nothing but pure vinegar, \n And that the vinegar was wine, at least \n Superior to the other. \n \n \n ","87":"\n There is the oinisteria too. The young men, when they are going to cut their hair,\n says Pamphilus, fill a large cup with wine, and bring it to Hercules; and they\n call this cup an oinisteria. And when they have poured a libation, they give it to\n the assembled people to drink. \n There is the ollix also. Pamphilus, in his Attic Words, describes this as a wooden\n cup. \n ","88":"\n There is also the panathenaicum. Posidonius the philosopher, in the thirty-sixth\n book of his History, mentions some cups called by this name, speaking\n thus\u2014 There were also cups made of an onyx, and also of several precious\n stones joined together, holding about two cotyl\u00e6. And very large cups, called\n panathenaica, some holding two choes, and some even larger. \n \n There is the proaron too. This was a wooden cup, into which\n the Athenians used to pour mixed wine. In hollow proara, says\n Pamphilus. \n ","89":"\n Then there is the pelica. Callistratus, in his Commentary on the Thracian Women of\n Cratinus, calls this a \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be. But Crates, in the\n second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect, writes thus:\u2014 Choes, as we\n have already said, were called pelic\u00e6. But the form of this vessel was it first\n like that of the panathenaica, when it was called pelica; but afterwards it was\n made of the same shape as the \u0153nochoe, such as those are which are put on the\n table at festivals, which they formerly used to call olp\u00e6, using them for\n infus- ing the wine, as Ion the Chian, in his Sons of Eurytus, says\u2014 \n You make a noise, intemperately drawing \n Superfluous wine from the large casks with olp\u00e6. \n But now a vessel of that sort, which has been consecrated in some\n fashion or other, is placed on the table at festivals alone. And that which\n comes into every-day use has been altered in form, being now generally made\n like a ladle, and we call it choeus. But Clitarchus says that the\n Corinthians, and Byzantians, and Cyprians call an oil-cruet, which is usually\n called lecythus, olpa; and the Thessalians call it prochous. But Seleucus says\n that the B\u0153otians call a \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03be pelichna; but\n Euphronius, in his Commentaries, says that they give this name to a choeus. \n ","90":"\n There is the pella. This is a vessel resembling the scyphus, having a wider\n bottom, into which men used to milk the cattle. Homer says\u2014 \n Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode, \n The pails \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 high foaming with a milky\n flood, \n The buzzing flies, a persevering train, \n Incessant swarm, and chased, return again. \n But Hipponax calls this pellis; saying,\u2014 \n Drinking from pellides; for there was not \n A culix there,\u2014the slave had fallen down, \n And broken it to pieces; \n showing, I imagine, very plainly that the pellis was not a drinking-cup,\n but that on this occasion they use it as one, from want of a regular culix. And in\n another place he says\u2014 \n And they at different times from out the pella \n Did drink; and then again Arete pledged them. \n But Ph\u0153nix the Colophonian, in his Iambics, interprets this word as\n identical with the phiala; saying,\u2014 \n \n For Thales,\u2014honestest of all the citizens, \n And, as they say, by far the best of men \n Who at that time were living upon earth,\u2014 \n Took up a golden pellis. \n And in another part he says\u2014 \n And with one hand he pours from out the pellis, \n Weak as he was in all his limbs and fingers, \n A sharp libation of sour vinegar, \n Trembling, like age, by Boreas much shaken. \n But Clitarchus, in his Dialects, says that the Thessalians and Aeolians\n call the milk-pail pelleter; but that it is a drinking-cup which they call pella.\n But Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says that the B\u0153otians give the name of\n pelleter to a culix. \n ","91":"\n There is also the pentaploa. Philochorus mentions this, in the second book of his\n treatise on Attic Affairs. But Aristodemus, in the third book of his Commentary on\n Pindar, says that on the third day of the Scira, games are celebrated at Athens,\n in which the young men run races; and that they run, holding in their hands a\n branch of the vine loaded with fruit, which is called oschus. And they run from\n the temple of Bacchus to the temple of Minerva Sciras; and he who has gained the\n victory takes a cup of the species called pentaplous, and feasts with the rest of\n the runners. But the cup is called pentaplous, as containing five \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 ingredients; inasmuch as it has in it wine, and\n honey, and cheese, and meal, and a little oil. \n There is the petachnum. This is a cup of a flat shape, which is mentioned by\n Alexis, in his Dropidas; and the passage has been already cited. And Aristophanes\n also mentions it in his Dramas, where he says\u2014 \n And every one in-doors drinks out of petachna. \n \n \n ","92":"\n There is the plemochoe, too. This is an earthenware vessel, shaped like a top, not\n very steady; and some people call it the cotyliscus, as Pamphilus tells us. But\n they use it at Eleusis on the last day of the Mysteries, which day they call\n Plemochoai, from the cups. And on this day they fill two plemocho\u00e6, and place one\n looking towards the east, and the other looking towards the west, saying over them\n a mystic form of words; and the author of the Pirithous names them (whoever he\n was, whether Critias the tyrant, or Euripides), saying,\u2014 \n That with well-omen'd words we now may pour \n These plemocho\u00e6 into the gulf below. \n \n \n \n There is a vessel, too, called the pristis; and that this is a species of cup has\n been already stated in the discussion on the batiacium. \n ","93":"\n There is the prochytes, too. This is a kind of drinking-cup, as Simaristus says,\n in the fourth book of his Synonymes. But Ion the Chian, in his Elegies, says\u2014\n \n But let the cupbearing maidens fill for us \n A crater with their silver prochyt\u00e6; \n and Philetas, in his Miscellanies, says it is a wooden vessel, from which\n the countrymen drink: and Alexander also mentions it in his Tigon. And Xenophon,\n in the eighth book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia, calls some kinds of culices, prochoides,\n writing thus (and it is of the Persians that he is speaking):\u2014 But it was a\n custom among them not to bring prochoides into their banquets, evidently\n because they think that not drinking too much is good both for the body and the\n mind. And even now the custom prevails that they do not bring them; but they\n drink such a quantity of wine that, instead of carrying in their cups, they\n themselves are carried out, when they can no longer go out themselves in an\n upright attitude. \n \n There is also the Prusias; and it has been already said that this is an upright\n kind of cup, and that it derived its name from Prusias king of Bithynia, who was a\n man very notorious for his luxury and effeminacy; as is mentioned by Nicander the\n Chalcedonian, in the fourth book of his History of the Events of the Life of\n Prusias. \n ","94":"\n There are also rheonta; for this was a name given to some cups: and Astydamas\n mentions them in his Mercury, speaking thus:\u2014 \n First of all were two silver craters large, \n And fifty phial\u00e6, and ten cymbia, \n And twelve rheonta, two of which were gold, \n The others silver;-of the gold ones, one \n Was like a griffin, one like Pegasus. \n \n \n There is also the rhysis. This is called a golden phiala by Theodorus; and\n Cratinus, in his Laws, says\u2014 Pouring a libation from a rhysis. \n \n ","95":"\n There is also the Rhodias. Diphilus, in his Stormer of Walls (but Callimachus\n calls the play The Eunuch), speaks thus\u2014 \n And they intend to drink more plenteously \n Than rhodiaca or rhyta can supply. \n \n Dioxippus, too, mentions this cup, in his Miser; and so does\n Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness; and so also does Lynceus the Samian, in\n his Letters. \n ","96":"\n There is also the rhytum\u2014 \u1fe5\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd. The \u03c5 is short, and the word has an acute accent on the last\n syllable. Demosthenes, in his speech against Midias, speaks of rhyta, and\n cymbia, and phial\u00e6. But Diphilus, in his Eunuch, or The Soldier, (and\n this play is a new edition of his Stormer of Walls,) says\u2014 \n And they intend to drink more plenteously \n Than rhodiaca or rhyta can supply. \n And Epinicus, in his Supposititious Damsels, says\u2014 \n \n A. And of the large-sized rhyta three are here; \n To-day one will be forced to drink more steadily, \n By the clepsydra. \n \n B. This, I think, will act \n Both says. \n \n A. Why, 'tis an elephant! \n \n B. Yes, he \n Is bringing round his elephants. \n \n A. A rhytus, \n Holding two choes, such as e'en an elephant \n Could hardly drink; but I have drunk it often. \n \n B. Yes, for you're very like an elephant. \n \n A. There is besides another kind of cup, \n Its name a trireme; this, too, holds one choeus. \n And, speaking of the rhytum, he says\u2014 \n \n A. Bellerophon, on Pegasus's back, \n Fought and subdued the fire-breathing Chim\u00e6nra. \n \n B. Well, take this cup. \n But formerly a drinking-horn was also called a rhytum; and it appears\n that this kind of vessel was first made by Ptolemy Philadelphus the king, to be\n carried by the statues of Ar- sinoe: for in her right hand she bears a vessel of\n this kind, full of all the fruits of the season; by which the makers of it\n designed to show that this horn is richer than the horn of Amalthea. And it is\n mentioned by Theocles, in his Ithyphallics, thus\u2014 \n For all the journeymen to-day \n Have sacrificed Soteria; \n And in their company I've drunk this cup, \n And now I go to my dear king. \n But Dionysius of Sinope, in his Female Saviour, giving a list of some\n cups, has also mentioned the rhytus, as I have said before;\n but Hedylus, in his Epigrams, mentioning the rhytum made by Ctesibius the engineer\n or machinist, speaks thus\u2014 \n Come hither, all ye drinkers of sheer wine,\u2014 \n Come, and within this shrine behold this rhytus, \n The cup of fair Arsinoe Zephyritis, \n The true Egyptian Besa, which pours forth \n Shrill sounds, what time its stream is open'd wide,\u2014 \n No sound of war; but from its golden mouth \n It gives a signal for delight and feasting, \n Such as the Nile, the king of flowing rivers, \n Pours as its melody from its holy shrines, \n Dear to the priests of sacred mysteries. \n But honour this invention of Ctesibius, \n And come, O youths, to fair Arsinoe's temple. \n But Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says that the cup\n called the rhytum is given to heroes alone. Dorotheus the Sidonian, says that the\n rhyta resemble horns, but are perforated at both ends, and men drink of them at\n the bottom as they send forth a gentle stream; and that it derives its name from\n the liquor flowing from them \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1fe5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \n \n ","97":"\n There is the sannacra too. Crates, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Attic\n Dialect, says that it is a drinking-cup which bears this name, but it is a Persian\n cup. But Philemon, in his Widow, mentioning the batiacia, and jesting on the\n ridiculousness of the name, says\u2014 \n The sannacra, and hippotragelaphi, \n And batiacia, and sannacia. \n There is also the Seleuci; and we have already stated that this cup\n derives its name from king Seleucus; Apollodorus the Athenian having made the same\n statement. But Polemo, in the first chapter of his treatise addressed to Ad\u00e6us,\n says these goblets are very like one another, the Seleucis, the Rhodias, and the\n Antigonis. \n Then, there is the scallium. This is a small cup \u02bd\u03ba\u0314\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u0313, with which the Aeolians pour libations, as Philetas\n tells us, in his Miscellanies. \n ","98":"\n There is also the scyphus. Now some people form the genitive of this word \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 with a \u03c2 \n invariably; but they are mistaken: for sometimes \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 is masculine, like \u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \n and then we form its genitive case without \u03c2 but\n when \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 is neuter, then we must decline with\n the \u03c2, \n \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, like \u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2\n \u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. . But the Attic writers use the \n nominative case in both the masculine and neuter genders. And Hesiod, in the\n second book of his Melampodia, writes the word with a \u03c0,\n \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b8\u03bf\u03c3- \u2014 \n To him came Mares, a swift messenger, \n Straight from his house; he fill'd a silver cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c3\u0313, \n \n And brought it in his hand, and gave it to the king. \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n And then the prophet in his right hand took \n The chain that held the bull; and on his back \n Iphiclus laid his hand: and following then, \n Holding a cup \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 in one hand, in the\n other \n Raising a staff, brave Phylacus advanced, \n And, standing amid the servants, thus he spoke. \n And in the same manner Anaximander in his Heroology speaks, where he\n says, But Amphitryon, when he had divided the booty among his allies, and\n having the cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b8\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 which he had selected\n for himself, . . . And in another place he says\u2014 But Neptune gives\n his \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 to Teleboas his own son, and\n Teleboas to Pteselaus; and he when he received it sailed away. And in\n the same manner Anacreon has said\u2014 \n But I, in my right hand holding \n A \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 full of wine, \n Drank to the health of the white-crested Erxion. \n (And in this last line he uses the verb \u1f10\u03be\u03ad\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd instead of \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ad\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd For\n properly speaking \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 means to give to some\n one else to drink before yourself. And so Ulysses, in Homer,\u2014 \n Gave to Arete first the well-fill'd cup. \n And in the Iliad he says\u2014 \n And first he fill'd a mighty cup of wine, \n Then pledg'd the hero, Peleus' son divine; \n for they used, when they had filled their cups, to pledge one another\n with a friendly address.) Panyasis, in the third book of his Heraclea, says\u2014\n \n This wine he pour'd into an ample bowl, \n Radiant with gold, and then with frequent draughts \n He drain'd the flowing cup. \n Euripides, in his Eurystheus, uses the word in the masculine gender\u2014\n \n And a long cup \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \n \n And so does Ach\u00e6us, in his Omphale\u2014 \n The goblet of the god invites me \u02bd\u1f41\u03b4\u1f72 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u02bd\u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u1f36. \n \n \n And Simonides too, speaking of a cup with handles, says,\n \u03bf\u1f50\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd. But Ion, in his Omphale,\n says\u2014 \n There is no wine in the cup \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f14\u03bd\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7\n \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u1f30, \n \n forming \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb regularly from \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, as a neuter noun. And in the same way\n Epicharmus, in his Cyclops, says\u2014 \n Come, pour the wine into the cup \u02bd\u1f11\u0313\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\n \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3\u0313. \n \n And Alexis, in his Leucadia, says\u2014 \n And with his aged lips he drank \n A mighty cup \u02bd\u03bc\u0314\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 of fragrant\n wine. \n And Epigenes, in his Bacchea, says\u2014 \n I rejoiced when I received \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n And Ph\u00e6dimus, in the first book of his Heraclea, says\u2014 \n A mighty cup \u02bd\u1f11\u1f50\u03c1\u1f7a \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 of well-grain'd\n timber framed, \n And fill'd with honied wine. \n And also in Homer, Aristophanes the Byzantian writes\u2014 \n But having filled a cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3\u0313, he gave\n it him, \n Having himself drunk from the same. \n \n \n But Aristarchus in this line writes \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd, \n not \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n \n \n But Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his treatise on the Nestoris, says that none of\n those who lived in the city, and none of the men of moderate property, used the\n scyphus \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9 and the cissybium; but only the\n swine-herds, and shepherds, and men in the fields, as Eum\u00e6us, for instance, \n Gave him the cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 from which he\n drank himself, \n Well filled with wine. \n And Al\u00e6man says\u2014 \n And often on the highest mountain tops, \n When some most tuneful festival of song \n Is held in honour of the Gods, you hold \n A golden vessel,\u2014a fine, ample cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\u0313, \n \n Such as the shepherds, pasturing their flocks \n On the high hills, delight in, . . . . . . . . \n . . . . . . . . . . . . have made cheese \n Most delicate and white to look upon. \n And Aeschylus, in his Perrh\u00e6bians, says\u2014 \n Where are my many gifts and warlike spoils,\u2014 \n Where are my gold and silver cups \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03c5\u03c6\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u1f00? \n \n And Stesichorus cans the cup on the board of Pholus the Centaur \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2, using \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd as synonymous to \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ad\u03c2. . And he says, when speaking of Hercules\u2013 \n And taking a huge scyphus-shaped cup \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u0313, \n \n Holding three measures, to his lips he raised it, \n \n Full of rich wine, which Pholus wisely mix'd \n And gave him; and at one good draught he drank it. \n And Archippus, in his Amphitryon, has used the word in the neuter\n gender. \n ","99":"\n But as for the word \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, they say that that is\n the name of a measure among the Greeks, as also are the words \u03c7\u03bf\u1f78\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7. And\n they say that the \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd contains twelve Attic\n \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9. .

But Nicostratus,\n in his Hecate, has used the word in the masculine gender, \u1f41\n \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, where he says\u2014 \n \n A.

They hold three choes each. \n And again he says\u2014 \n Bring us the full flagon \u02bd\u03c4\u0314\u1f78\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd\n \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u0313. \n \n And, in the play entitled The Couch, he says\u2014 \n And this most odious flagon's \u02bd\u03bb\u0314\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\n \u03bf\u1f57\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 full of vinegar. \n Diphilus, in his People Saved, says\u2014 \n I have an empty flagon, my good woman, \n And a full wallet. \n And Lynceus the Samian, in his letter to Diagoras, says, \u2014 At the\n time that you sojourned in Samos, O Diagoras, I know that you often came to\n banquets at my house, at which a flagon was placed by each man, and filled with\n wine, so as to allow every one to drink at his pleasure. And Aristotle,\n in his Constitution of the Thessalians, says that the word is used by the\n Thessalians in the feminine gender, as \u1f21 \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. \n And Rhianus the epic poet, in his Epigrams, says\u2014 \n This flagon \u02bd\u1f25\u03b4\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u0313 O Archinus, seems\n to hold \n One half of pitch from pines, one half of wine; \n And I have never met a leaner kid: \n And he who sent these dainties to us now, \n Hippocrates, has done a friendly deed, \n And well deserves to meet with praise from all men. \n But Diphilus, in his Brothers, has used the word in the neuter gender\u2014\n \n O conduct worthy of a housebreaker \n Or felon, thus to take a flagon now \n Under one's arm, and so go round the inns; \n And then to sell it, while, as at a picnic, \n \n One single vintner doth remain behind, \n Defrauded by his wine-merchant. \n And the line in the Geryonis of Stesichorus\u2014 A measure of three flagons\n \u02bd\u1f11\u0313\u0301\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f61\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u0313 leaves it quite\n uncertain under what gender the word is to be classed as far as respects that\n line. But Eratosthenes says that the words \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \n and \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 are also used as feminine nouns by\n some authors. \n ","100":"\n But the name \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is derived from \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u1f76\u03c2, a little boat. And this likewise is a round\n vessel made of wood, intended to receive milk, or whey; as it is said in Homer\u2014\n \n Capacious chargers all around were laid, \n Full pails \u02bd\u03c3\u0314\u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u0313, and vessels of the\n milking trade. \n Unless, indeed, \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is quasi \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, because the Scythians were in the habit of\n drinking more than was decent. But Hieronymus the Rhodian, in his treatise on\n Drunkenness, says to get drunk is called \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b6\u03c9; ;\n for that \u03b8 is a cognate letter to \u03c6 . But at subsequent times scyphi were made of\n earthenware and of silver, in imitation of the wooden ones. And the first makers\n of cups of this kind were the B\u0153otians, who obtained a high reputation for their\n manufacture; because Hercules originally used these cups in his expeditions. On\n which account they are called Heracleotici by some people. And they are different\n from other cups; for they have on their handles what is called the chain of\n Hercules. And Bacchylides mentions the B\u0153otian scyphi in these words, (addressing\n his discourse to Castor and Pollux, and invoking their attendance at a banquet)\u2014\n \n Here there are no mighty joints \n Of oxen slain,\u2014no golden plate, \n No purple rich embroidery; \n But there is a cheerful mind, \n And a sweetly-sounding Muse, \n And plenty of delicious wine, \n In cups of Theban workmanship \u02bd\u03b2\u0314\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\n \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u0313. \n \n And next to the B\u0153otian scyphi, those which had the highest reputation\n were the Rhodian ones, of the workmanship of Damocrates. And the next to them were\n the Syracusan cups. But the \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is called by\n the Epirotes \u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2, as Seleucus reports; and by\n the Methymn\u00e6ans it is called \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, as Parmeno\n says, in his book on Dialects. And Dercyllidas the\n Laced\u00e6monian was nicknamed \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, as Ephorus\n relates in his eighteenth book, where he speaks as follows:\u2014 The\n Laced\u00e6monians sent Dercyllidas into Asia in the place of Thymbron, having heard\n that the barbarians were in the habit of doing everything by deceit and trick;\n on which account they sent Dercyllidas, thinking that he was the least likely\n of all men to be taken in; for he was not at all of a Laced\u00e6monian and simple\n disposition, but exceedingly cunning and fierce; on which account the\n Laced\u00e6monians themselves used to call him \u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n \n ","101":"\n There is the tabaitas also. Amyntas, in the first book of his treatise on the\n Stations of Asia, speaking of what is called aerial honey, writes as\n follows:\u2014 They gather it with the leaves, and store it up, making it up\n in the same manner as the Syrian cakes of fruit, but some make it into balls;\n and when they are about to use it for food, they break pieces off these cakes\n into wooden cups, which they call tabait\u00e6, and soak them, and then strain them\n off and drink the liquor; and the drink is very like diluted honey, but this is\n much the sweeter of the two. \n \n There is also the tragelaphus. And this is the name given to some cups, as Alexis\n mentions, in his Coniates\u2014 \n Cymbia, phial\u00e6, tragelaphi, culices. \n And Eubulus, in his Man Glued on, says\u2014 \n But there are five phial\u00e6, and two tragelaphi. \n And Menander, in his Fisherman, says\u2014 \n Tragelaphi, labronii. \n And Antiphanes, in his Chrysis, says\u2014 \n And for this rich and sordid bridegroom now, \n Who owns so many talents, slaves, and stewards, \n And pairs of horses, camels, coverlets,\u2014 \n Such loads of silver plate, such phial\u00e6, \n Triremes, tragelaphi, carchesia, \n Milkpails of solid gold, vessels of all sorts; \n For all the gluttons and the epicures \n Call casks brimful of wine mere simple milkpails. \n \n \n There is also the trireme. And that trireme is the name of a species of\n drinking-cup Epicurus has shown, in his Supposititious Damsels; and the passage\n which is a proof of this has been already quoted. \n There is also the hystiacum, which is some sort of drinking-cup. Rhinthon, in his\n Hercules, says\u2014 \n \n You swallow'd, in one small hystiacum, \n A cheesecake of pure meal, and groats, and flour. \n \n \n ","102":"\n There is the phiale too. Homer, when he says\u2014 \n He placed a phiale upon the board, \n By both hands to be raised ( \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ),\n untouch'd by fire; \n and again, when he says\u2014 \n A golden phiale, and doubled fat; \n is not speaking of a drinking-cup, but of a brazen vessel of a flat shape\n like a caldron, having perhaps two handles, one on each side. But Parthenius the\n pupil of Dionysius understands by \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd a\n phiale without any bottom. But Apollodorus the Athenian, in his short essay on the\n Crater, says that it means a cup which cannot be firmly placed and steadied on its\n bottom, but only on its mouth. But some say, that just as the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 is used for a cup which can be lifted by its\n handles on both sides, the same is meant by the expression \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7. But Aristarchus says that it means a cup which can\n be placed on either end, on its mouth or on its bottom. But Dionysius the Thracian\n says that the word \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 means round, running\n round ( \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd ) in a circular form. And\n Asclepiades the Myrlean says,\u2014\"The word \u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, by\n a change of letters, becomes \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7, a cup which\n contains enough to drink ( \u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f05\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 ); for it is\n larger than the \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. But when Homer calls it\n also \u1f00\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, he means either that it was wrought\n without fire, or never put on the fire. On which account he calls a kettle which\n may be put on the fire \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, and one which\n is not so used \u1f04\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. And when he says\u2014 \n An ample charger, of unsullied frame, \n With flowers high wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame, \n he perhaps means one intended to receive cold water. So that the phiale\n would in that case resemble a flat brazen vessel, holding cold water. But when he\n calls it \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, can we understand that it has\n two bases, one on each side; or is \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u1f76 here to be\n taken as equivalent to \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76, and t en again is\n \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 to be taken as equivalent to \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, so that in fact all that is meant by the\n epithet is beautifully made; since \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 was\n often used by the ancients for 'to make?' It may also mean, ' being capable of\n being placed either on its bottom or upon its mouth;' and such a placing of cups\n is an Ionian and an ancient fashion. And even now the\n Massilians often adopt it, and set their goblets down on their mouths.\" \n ","103":"\n But as Cratinus has said, in his Female Runaways\u2014 \n Receive from me these round-bottom'd phial\u00e6, \n Eratosthenes, in the eleventh book of his treatise on Comedy, says that\n Lycophron did not understand the meaning of the word ( \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ), for that the word \u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2, as applied to a phiale, and the word \u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, as applied to a bath, were nearly similar in meaning; and\n that, in the word, allusion is neatly enough made to the umbilical form. But Apion\n and Diodorus say, There are some kinds of phial\u00e6 of which the boss is\n similar to a strainer. But Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his Essays on\n Cratinus, says\u2014 \n \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 are the Phial\u00e6 called, because\n their bosses and the vaulted roofs of the baths are much alike. And\n Didymus, saying the same thing, cites the words of Lycophron, which run thus:\u2014\n From the bosses in the women's baths, out of which they ladle the water\n in small cups. But Timarchus, in the fourth book of his Essay on the\n Mercury of Eratosthenes, says,\u2014\"Any one may suppose that this word contains a\n secret allusion in it, because most of the baths at Athens, being circular in\n their shape, and in all their furniture, have slight projections in the middle, on\n which a brazen boss is placed. Ion, in his Omphale, says\u2014 \n Go quick, O damsels; hither bring the cups, \n And the mesomphali;\u2014 \n and by \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 here, he means the same\n things as those which Cratinus calls \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, where he says\u2014 \n Receive from me these round-bottom'd phial\u00e6. \n And Theopompus, in his Alth\u00e6a, said\u2014 \n She took a golden round-bottom'd ( \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) phiale, \n Brimful of wine; to which Telestes gave \n The name of acatos; \n as Telestes had called the phiale an acatos, or boat. But Pherecrates, or\n whoever the poet was who composed the Pers\u00e6, which are attributed to him, says, in\n that play\u2014 \n Garlands to all, and well-boss'd chrysides ( \u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76\n \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ). \n \n \n ","104":"\n But the Athenians call silver phial\u00e6 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n and golden ones they call \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2.

Among the Gortynians this is the name given to a\n species of cup resembling the thericleum, made of brass, which Hermonax says is\n given by lovers to the objects of their affection. \n There are also Chalcidic goblets, having their name and reputation perhaps from\n Chalcis in Thrace. \n \n ","106":"\n There are also \u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2; Alexis, in his\n Supposititious Child, says\u2014 \n I, seeking to do honour to the king, \n To Ptolemy and to his sister, took \n Four \u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 of strong, untemper'd\n wine, \n And drank them at a draught, with as much pleasure \n As any one ever swallow'd half-and-half: \n And, for the sake of this agreement, why \n Should I not now feast in this splendid light? \n But Herodotus, in the fifth book of his History, says that the\n Argives and Aeginetans made a law that no one should ever use any Attic vessel\n of any kind in their sacrifices, not even if made of earthenware; but that for\n the future every one should drink out of the \u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 of the country.

Euphorion, in his Woman\n Restoring, says\u2014 \n But when they call a \u03c8\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 a \u03c8\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, \n \n And \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bb\u03b1, and the \u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u1fc6 \u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2, \n \n What can one do? For I rightly said, \n Give me, I pray, Pyrgothemis, some change \n For this your language, as for foreign money. \n And Antiphanes, in his Knights, says\u2014 \n How then are we to live? Our bedclothes are \n A saddlecloth, and our well-fitting hat \n Only a psycter. What would you have more? \n Here is the very Amalthean horn. \n And in the Carna he declares plainly that, when pouring out wine, they\n used the psycter for a cyathus. For after he had said\u2014 \n And putting on the board a tripod and cask, \n And psycter too, he gets drunk on the wine; \n in the passage following, he represents his man as saying\u2014 \n So will the drink be fiercer: therefore now, \n If any one should say it is not fit \n T' indulge in wine at present, just leave out \n This cask, and this one single drinking-cup, \n And carry all the rest away at once. \n \n \n But Dionysius the pupil of Tryphon, in his treatise on Names, says\u2014 The\n ancients used to call the psygeus dinus. But Nicander of Thyatira says,\n that woods and shady places dedicated to the gods are also called \u03c8\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, as being places where one may cool oneself\n ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c8\u03cd\u03be\u03b1\u03b9 ). Aeschylus, in his Young Men, says\u2014\n \n And gentle airs, in the cool, shady places ( \u03c8\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c5\u03b9\u03c2 ); \n \n and Euripides, in his Phaethon, says\u2014 \n The trees, affording a cool shade ( \u03c8\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ), \n Shall now embrace him in their loving arms; \n and the author of the poem called Aegimius, whether it really was Hesiod,\n or only Cecrops of Miletus, says\u2014 \n There shall my cool shade ( \u03c8\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) be, O\n king of men. \n \n \n ","109":"\n There is also the oidos. This was the name of a drinking-cup, as we are told by\n Tryphon, in his Onomasticon; a cup given to him who sang the scolia\u2014as Antiphanes\n shows in his Doubles\u2014 \n \n A. What will there be, then, for the gods \n \n B. Why, nothing, \n Unless now some one mixes wine for them. \n \n A. Stop; take this \u1fa0\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2, and abandon all \n Those other worn-out fashions; sing no more \n Of Telamon, or P\u00e6on, or Harmodius. \n There are also the ooscyphia. Now respecting the shape of these cups,\n Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his Essay on the Nestoris, says that it has two\n bottoms, one of them wrought on to the bowl of the cup, and of the same piece with\n it; but the other attached to it, beginning with a sharp point, and ending in a\n broad bottom, on which the cup stands. \n There is also the \u1f60\u1f78\u03bd, or egg-cup. Dinon, in the\n third book of his Affairs of Persia, speaks as follows:\u2014There is also a bread\n called potibazis, made of barley and roasted wheat; and a crown of cypress leaves;\n and wine tempered in a golden oon, from which the king himself drinks.\" \n ","110":"\n Plutarch having said this, and being applauded by every one, asked for a phiala,\n from which he made a libation to the Muses, and to Mnemosyne their mother, and\n drank the health of every one present, saying,\u2014As if any one, taking a cup in his\n hand, being a rich man, were to make a present of it, foaming over with the juice\n of the vine;\"\u2014 and drinking not only to the young bridegroom, but also to all his\n friends; and he gave the cup to the boy, desiring him to carry it round to every\n one, saying that this was the proper meaning of the phrase \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u1ff3 \u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, reciting the verses of Menander in his Perinthian\n Woman\u2014 \n And the old woman did not leave untouch'd \n One single cup, but drank of all that came. \n And again, in his Fanatical Woman, he says\u2014 \n \n And then again she carries round to all \n A cup of unmix'd wine. \n And Euripides, in his Cretan Women, says\u2014 \n Farewell all other things, as long \n As cups of wine go freely round. \n And then, when Leonidas the grammarian demanded a larger cup, and\n said,\u2014Let us drink hard ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd ), my\n friends, (for that was the word which Lysanias the Cyrenean says that Herodorus\n used to apply to drinking parties, when he says, But when they had finished\n the sacrifice they turned to the banquet, and to craters, and prayers, and\n peas; and the poet, who was the author of the poem called the\n Buffoons\u2014a play which Duris says that the wise Plato always had in his hands\u2014says,\n somewhere, \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c2, for we had\n drunk; ) But now, in the name of the gods, said Pontianus, you are\n drinking in a manner which is scarcely becoming, out of large cups, having that\n most delightful and witty author Xenophon before your eyes, who in his Banquet\n says,\u2014 But Socrates, in his turn, said, But it seems to me now, O men,\n that we ought to drink hard. For wine, in reality, while it moistens the\n spirit, lulls the griefs to sleep as mandragora does men; but it awakens all\n cheerful feelings, as oil does fire. And it appears to me that the bodies of\n men are liable to the same influences which affect the bodies of those things\n which grow in the ground; for the very plants, when God gives them too much to\n drink, cannot hold up their heads, nor can they expand at their proper seasons.\n But when they drink just as much as is good for them, and no more, then they\n grow in an upright attitude, and flourish, and come in a flourishing state to\n produce fruit. And so, too, in our case, if we take too much drink all at once,\n our bodies and our minds rapidly get disordered, and we cannot even breathe\n correctly, much less speak. But if our slaves bedew us (to use Gorgias-like\n language) in small quantities with small cups, then we are not compelled to be\n intoxicated by the wine; but being gently induced, we proceed to a merry and\n cheerful temperament. \n \n ","111":"\n Now, any one who considers these expressions of the accomplished Xenophon, may\n understand how it as that the brilliant Plato displayed such jealousy of him. But\n perhaps the fact may partly be because these men did from the very beginning feel a spirit of rivalry towards one another, each\n being aware of his own powers; and perhaps they began very early to contend for\n the preeminence, as we may conjecture not only from what they have both written\n about Cyrus, but also from other writings of theirs on similar subjects. For they\n have both written a piece called the Banquet; and in these two pieces, one of them\n turns out the female flute-players, and the other introduces them; and one, as has\n been already said, refuses to drink out of large cups, but the other represents\n Socrates as drinking out of a psycter till morning. And in his treatise concerning\n the Soul, Plato, reckoning up all who were present, does not make even the\n slightest mention of Xenophon. And concerning Cyrus, the one says that from his\n earliest youth he was trained up in all the national practices of his country; but\n Plato, as if in the express spirit of contradiction, says, in the third book of\n his Laws,\u2014 But with respect to Cyrus, I consider that, as to other things,\n he was indeed a skilful and careful general, but that he had never had the very\n least particle of a proper education, and that he had never turned his mind the\n least in the world to the administration of affairs. But he appears from his\n earliest youth to have been engaged in war, and to have given his children to\n his wives to bring up. And again, Xenophon, who joined Cyrus with the\n Ten Thousand Greeks, in his expedition into Persia, and who was thoroughly\n acquainted with the treachery of Meno the Thessalian, and knew that he was the\n cause of the murder of Clearchus by Tissaphernes, and who knew also the\n disposition of the man, how morose and debauched he was,\u2014has given us a full\n account of everything concerning him. But the exquisite Plato, who all but says,\n All this is not true, goes through a long panegyric on him, who\n was incessantly calumniating every one else. And in his Polity, he banishes Homer\n from his city, and all poetry of the theatrical kind; and yet he himself wrote\n dialogues in a theatrical style,\u2014a manner of writing of which he himself was not\n the inventor; for Alexamenus the Teian had, before him, invented this style of\n dialogue, as Nicias of Nic\u00e6a and Sotion both agree in relating. And Aristotle, in\n his treatise on Poets, writes thus:\u2014 Let us not then call those Mimes, as\n they are called, of Sophron, which are written in metre, Discourses and\n Imitations; or those Dialogues of Alexamenus of Teos,\n which were written before the Scratic Dialogues; \u2014 Aristotle, the most\n learned of all men, stating here most expressly that Alexamenus composed his\n Dialogues before Plato. And Plato also calumniates Thrasymachus of Chalcedon,\n saying that he was a sophist in a way consistent with his name. And he also attacks\n Hippias, and Gorgias, and Parmenides; and in one dialogue, called Protagoras, he\n attacks a great many;\u2014a man who in his Republic has said, When, as I think,\n a city which has been governed by a democracy, feels a thirst far liberty, and\n meets with bad cupbearers, and so it gets intoxicated by too untempered a\n draught . . . \n \n ","112":"\n And it is said also, that Gorgias himself, when he read the dialogue to which\n Plato has given his name, said to his friends, How well Plato knows how to\n write iambics! And Hermippus, in his book on Gorgias, says,\u2014 When\n Gorgias was sojourning at Athens, after he had offered up at Delphi the golden\n image of himself which is there now, and when Plato said when he had seen it,\n The beautiful and golden Gorgias is come among us, Gorgias replied, This is\n indeed a fine young Archilochus whom Athens has now brought forth. But\n others say that Gorgias, having read the dialogue of Plato, said to the bystanders\n that he had never said any of the things there attributed to him, and had never\n heard any such things said by Plato. And they say that Ph\u00e6do also said the same\n when he had read the treatise on the Soul, on which account it was well said by\n Timon, respecting him,\u2014 \n \n How that learned Plato invented fictitious marvels! \n \n For their respective ages will scarcely admit of the Socrates of Plato\n ever having really had a conference with Parmenides, so as to have addressed him\n and to have been addressed by him in such language. And what is worst of all is,\n that he has said, though there was not the slightest occasion for making any such\n assertion, that Zeno had been beloved by Parmenides, who was his fellow-citizen.\n Nor, indeed, is it possible that Ph\u00e6drus should have lived in the time of\n Socrates, much less that he should have been beloved by him. Nor, again, is it\n possible that Paralus and Xanthippus, the sons of Pericles, who died of the\n plague, should have conversed with Protagoras when he came the second time to Athens, as they had died before. And we might mention many\n other particulars respecting his works to show how wholly fictitious his Dialogues\n are. \n ","113":"\n But that Plato was ill-natured to everybody is plain from what he says in his\n dialogue entitled Ion; in which first of all he abuses all the poets, and then all\n those who have been promoted to the highest dignities by the people, such as\n Phanosthenes of Andros, and Apollodorus of Cyzicus, and also Heraclides of\n Clazomen\u00e6. And in his Menon he abuses those who have been the greatest men among\n the Athenians\u2014Aristides and Themistocles; and he extols Meno, who betrayed the\n Greeks. But in his Euthydemus he attacks this same Meno and his brother\n Dionysiodorus, and calls them men slow to learn any good thing, and contentious\n people, reproaching them with their flight from Chios, which was their native\n place, from which they went and settled in Thurii. And, in his essay on Manly\n Courage, he attacks Melesias, the son of that Thucydides who headed the opposite\n party to Pericles, and Lysimachus, the son of Aristides the Just, saying that they\n both fell far short of their fathers' virtues. And as to what he said about\n Alcibiades, in his Banquet, that is not fit to be produced to light; nor is what\n he says in the first of the Dialogues which go by his name. For the second\n Alcibiades is said by some people to be the work of Xenophon; as also the Halcyon\n is said to be the work of Leon the Academician, as Nicias of Nic\u00e6a says. Now, the\n things which he has said against Alcibiades I will pass over; but I cannot forbear\n to mention his calling the Athenian people a random judge, guided only by outward\n appearance. And he praises the Laced\u00e6monians, and extols also the Persians, who\n are the enemies of all the Greeks. \n And he calls Cleinias the brother of Alcibiades a madman; and the sons of Pericles\n he makes out to be fools; and Meidias he calls a man fit for nothing but killing\n quails; and of the people of the Athenians he says, that it wears a fair mask, but\n that one ought to strip the mask off, and look at it then; for he says that it\n will then be seen that it is only clothed with a specious appearance of a beauty\n which is not genuine. \n ","114":"\n But in the Cimon he does not abstain from accusing Themistocles, and Alcibiades,\n and Myronides, and even Cimon himself; and his Crito contains an invective against\n Sopho- cles; and his Gorgias contains an invective not only\n against the man from whom it is named, but also against Archelaus, king of\n Macedon, whom he reproaches not only with his ignoble birth, but also with having\n killed his master. And this is the very same Plato whom Speusippus represents as\n having, while he professed to be a great friend of Archelaus assisted Philip to\n get possession of the kingdom. At all events, Carystius of Pergamus, in his\n Historical Commentaries, writes as follows:\u2014 Speusippus, hearing that Philip\n used calumnious language respecting Plato, wrote something of this sort in his\n letter to him: 'Just as if men did not know that Philip originally obtained the\n kingdom by the assistance of Plato.' For Plato sent Euphr\u00e6us of Oreum to\n Perdiccas, who persuaded him to apportion a certain district to Philip; and so\n he, maintaining a force in that country, when Perdiccas died, having all his\n forces in a state of preparation, seized the supreme power. But whether\n all this is true or not, God knows. \n But his fine Protagoras, besides that it contains attacks on many poets and wise\n men, also shows up the life of Callias with much greater severity than Eupolis\n does in his flatterers. And in his Menexenus, not only is Hippias the Elean turned\n into ridicule, but also Antipho the Rhamnusian, and Lamprus the musician. And the\n day would fail me, if I were inclined to go through the names of all those who\n have been abused by that wise man. Nor indeed do I praise Antisthenes; for he,\n having abused many men, did not abstain even from Plato himself, but, having given\n him the odious name of Sathon, he then published a dialogue under this name. \n ","115":"\n But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, speaking about the universal\n ill-nature of Plato towards everybody, writes as follows:\u2014 After the death\n of Socrates, when a great many of his friends, being present at a banquet, were\n very much out of spirits, Plato, being present, taking the cup, exhorted them\n not to despond, as he himself was well able to lead the school; and, so saying,\n he pledged Apollodorus: and he said, I would rather have taken the cup of\n poison from Socrates than that pledge of wine from you.' For Plato was\n considered to be an envious man, and to have a disposition which was far from\n praiseworthy; for he ridiculed Aristippus when he went to\n visit Dionysius, though he himself had three times sailed to Sicily,\u2014once for\n the purpose of investigating the torrents of lava which flow from Mount Aetna,\n when he lived with the elder Dionysius, and was in danger from his displeasure;\n and twice he went to visit the younger Dionysius. \n \n And again, though Aeschines was a poor man, and had but one pupil, Xenocrates, he\n seduced him from him; and he was also detected in instigating the commencement of\n a prosecution against Ph\u00e6do, which, if successful, would have reduced him to\n slavery; and altogether he displayed the feelings of a stepmother towards all the\n pupils of Socrates. On which account, Socrates, making a not very unreasonable\n Conjecture respecting him, said in the presence of several persons that he had had\n a dream, in which he thought he had seen the following vision. For I\n thought, said he, that Plato had become a crow, and leaped on my\n head, and began to scratch my bald place, and to take a firm hold, and so to\n look about him. I think, therefore, said he, that you, O Plato,\n will say a good many things which are false about my head. And Plato,\n besides his ill-nature, was very ambitious and vainglorious; and he said,\n My last tunic, my desire of glory, I lay aside in death itself\u2014in my\n will, and in my funeral procession, and in my burial; as Dioscorides\n relates in his Memorabilia. And as for his desire of founding cities and making\n laws, who will not say that these are very ambitious feelings? And this is plain\n from what he says in the Tim\u00e6us\u2014 I have the same feelings towards my\n constitution that a painter would have towards his works; for as he would wish\n to see them possessed of the power of motion and action, so too do I wish to\n see the citizens whom I here describe. \n \n ","116":"\n But concerning the things which he has said in his Dialogues, what can any one\n say? For the doctrine respecting the soul, which he makes out to be immortal, even\n after it is separated from the body, and after the dissolution of this latter, was\n first mentioned by Homer; for he has said, that the soul of Patroclus\u2014 \n Fled to the shades below, \n Lamenting its untimely fate, and leaving \n Its vigour and its youth. \n If, then, any one were to say that this is also the argument of Plato, still I do not see what good we have got from him; for\n if any one were to agree that the souls of those who are dead do migrate into\n other natures, and do mount up to some higher and purer district, as partaking of\n its lightness, still what should we get by that theory? For, as we have neither\n any recollection of where we formerly were, nor any perception whether we really\n existed at all, what do we get by such an immortality as that? \n And as to the book of the Laws composed by him, and the Polity which was written\n before the Laws, what good have they done us? And yet he ought (as Lycurgus did\n the Laced\u00e6monians, and as Solon did the Athenians, and Zaleucus the Thurians), if\n they were excellent, to have persuaded some of the Greeks to adopt them. For a law\n (as Aristotle says) is a form of words decided on by the common agreement of a\n city, pointing out how one ought to do everything. And how can we consider Plato's\n conduct anything but ridiculous; since, when there were already three Athenian\n lawgivers who had a great name,\u2014Draco, and Plato himself, and Solon,\u2014the citizens\n abide by the laws of the other two, but ridicule those of Plato? And the case of\n the Polity is the same. Even if his Constitution is the best of all possible\n constitutions, yet, if it does not persuade us to adopt it, what are we the better\n for it? Plato, then, appears to have written his laws, not for men who have any\n real existence, but rather for a set of men invented by himself; so that one has\n to look for people who will use them. But it would have been better for him to\n write such things as he could persuade men of; and not to act like people who only\n pray, but rather like those who seize hold of what offers itself to them. \n ","117":"\n However, to say no more on this point, if any one were to go through his Tim\u00e6us\n and his Gorgias, and his other dialogues of the same character, in which he\n discuss the different subjects of education, and subjects of natural philosophy,\n and several other circumstances,\u2014even when considered in this light, he is not to\n be admired on this account; for one may find these same topics handled by others,\n either better than by him, or at all events not worse. For Theopompus the Chian,\n in his book Against the School of Plato, says\u2014 We shall find the greater\n part of his Dialogues useless and false, and a still greater number borrowed\n from other people; as some of them come from the school of\n Aristippus, and some from that of Antisthenes, and a great many from that of\n Bryson of Heraclea. And as to the disquisitions which he enters into\n about man, we also seek in his arguments for what we do not find. But what we do\n find are banquets, and conversations about love, and other very unseemly\n harangues, which he composed with great contempt for those who were to read them,\n as the greater part of his pupils were of a tyrannical and calumnious\n disposition. \n ","118":"\n For Euphr\u00e6us, when he was sojourning with king Perdiccas in Macedonia, was not\n less a king than the other, being a man of a depraved and calumnious disposition,\n who managed all the companionship of the king in so cold a manner, that no one was\n allowed to partake of his entertainments unless he knew something about geometry\n or philosophy; on which account, after Philip obtained the government, Parmenio,\n having caught him in Oreum, put him to death; as Carystius relates in his\n Historical Com- mentaries. And Callippus the Athenian, who was himself a pupil of\n Plato, having been a companion and fellow-pupil of Dion, and having travelled with\n him to Syracuse, when he saw that Dion was attempting to make himself master of\n the kingdom, slew him; and afterwards, attempting to usurp the supreme power\n himself, was slain too. And Euagon of Lampsacus (as Eurypylus says, and Dic\u00e6ocles\n of Cnidus, in the ninety-first book of his Commentaries, and also Demochares the\n orator, in his argument in defence of Sophocles, against Philo), having lent his\n native city money on the security of its Acropolis, and being afterwards unable to\n recover it, endeavoured to seize on the tyranny, until the Lampsacenes attacked\n him, and repaid him the money, and drove him out of the city. And Tim\u00e6us of\n Cyzicus (as the same Demochares relates), having given largesses of money and corn\n to his fellow-citizens, and being on this account believed by the Cyzicenes to be\n an excellent man, after having waited a little time, attempted to overturn the\n constitution with the assistance of Arid\u00e6us; and being brought to trial and\n convicted, and branded with infamy, he remained in the city to an extreme old age,\n being always, however, considered dishonoured and infamous. \n And such now are some of the Academicians, who live in a\n scandalous and infamous manner. For they, having by impious and unnatural means\n acquired vast wealth by trickery, are at present highly thought of; as Ch\u00e6on of\n Pellene, who was not only a pupil of Plato, but of Xenocrates also. And he too,\n having usurped the supreme power in his country, and having exercised it with\n great severity, not only banished the most virtuous men in the city, but also gave\n the property of the masters to their slaves, and gave their wives also to them,\n compelling them to receive them as their husbands; having got all these admirable\n ideas from that excellent Polity and those illegal Laws of Plato. \n ","119":"\n On which account Ephippus the comic poet, in his Shipwrecked Man, has turned into\n ridicule Plato himself, and some of his acquaintances, as being sycophants for\n money, showing that they used to dress in a most costly manner, and that they paid\n more attention to the elegance of their persons than even the most extravagant\n people among us. And he speaks as follows\u2014 \n Then some ingenious young man rising up, \n Some pupil of the New Academy, \n Brought up at Plato's feet and those of Bryso, \n That bold, contentious, covetous philosopher,\u2014 \n And urged by strong necessity, and able, \n By means of his small-wages-seeking art, \n To speak before th' assembly, in a manner \n Not altogether bad; having his hair \n Carefully trimm'd with a new-sharpen'd razor, \n And letting down his beard in graceful fall, \n Putting his well-shod foot in his neat slipper, \n Binding his ancles in the equal folds \n Of his well-fitting hose, and well protected \n Across the chest with the breastplate of his cloak, \n And leaning, in a posture dignified, \n Upon his staff; said, as it seems to me, \n With mouthing emphasis, the following speech, \n More like a stranger than a citizen,\u2014 \n \n Men of the land of wise Athenians. \n \n And here let us put an end to this part of the discussion, my friend\n Timocrates. And we will next proceed to speak of those who have been notorious for\n their luxury. \n "},"11":{"0":"\n You appear to me, my good friend Timocrates, to be a man of Cyrene, according to\n the Tyndareus of Alexis\u2014 \n For there if any man, invites another \n To any banquet, eighteen others come; \n Ten chariots, and fifteen pairs of horses, \n And for all these you must provide the food, \n So that 'twere better to invite nobody \n And it would be better for me also to hold my tongue, and not to add\n anything more to all that has been said already; but since you ask me very\n earnestly for a discussion on those men who have been notorious for luxury, and on\n their effeminate practices, you must be gratified. \n ","1":"\n For enjoyment is connected, in the first instance, with appetite; and in the\n second place, with pleasure. And Sophocles the poet, being a man fond of\n enjoyment, in order to avoid accusing old age, attributed his impotence in amatory\n pleasures to his temperance, saying that he was glad to be released from them as\n from some hard master. But I say that the Judgment of Paris is a tale originally\n invented by the 'ancients, as a comparison between pleasure and virtue.\n Accordingly, when Venus, that is to say pleasure, was preferred, everything was\n thrown into confusion. And that excellent writer Xenophon seems to me to have\n invented his fable about Hercules and Virtue on the same principle. For according\n to Empedocles\u2014 \n Mars was no god to them, nor gallant War, \n Nor Jupiter the king, nor Saturn old, \n Nor Neptune; Venus was their only queen. \n Her they propitiate and duly worship \n With pious images, with beauteous figures \n Skilfully carved; with fragrant incenses, \n And holy offerings of unmix'd myrrh, \n And sweetly smelling frankincense; and many. . \n A pure libation of fresh golden honey \n They pour'd along the floor. \n \n And Menander, in his Harp-player, speaking of some one who\n was very fond of music, says\u2014 \n He was to music much devoted, and \n Sought ever pleasing sounds to gratify \n His delicate taste. \n \n \n ","2":"\n And yet some people say that the desire of pleasure is a natural desire, as may be\n proved by all animals becoming enslaved by it; as if cowardice, and fear, and all\n sorts of other passions were not also common to all animals, and yet these are\n rejected by all who use their reason. Accordingly, to be very eager in the pursuit\n of pleasure is to go hunting for pain. On which account Homer, wishing to\n represent pleasure in an odious light, says that the greatest of the gods receive\n no advantage from their power, but are even much injured by it, if they will allow\n themselves to be hurried away by the pursuit of pleasure. For all the anxiety\n which Jupiter, when awake, lavished on the Trojans, was lost in open day, when he\n abandoned himself to pleasure. And Mars, who was a most valiant deity, was put in\n chains by Vulcan, who was very powerless, and incurred great disgrace and\n punishment, when he had given himself up to irrational love; and therefore he says\n to the Gods, when they came to see him in fetters\u2014 \n Behold, on wrong \n Swift vengeance waits, and art subdues the strong. \n Dwells there a god on all th' Olympian brow \n More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow? \n Yet Vulcan conquers, and the God of arms \n Must pay the penalty for lawless charms. \n \n But no one ever calls the life of Aristides a life of pleasure ( \u1f21\u03b4\u1f7a\u03c2 ), but that is an epithet they apply to Smindyrides\n the Sybarite, and to Sardanapalus, though as far as glory went, as Theophrastus\n says in his book on Pleasure, it was a far more splendid one; but Aristides never\n devoted himself to luxury as those other men did. Nor would any one call the life\n of Agesilaus the king of the Laced\u00e6monians \u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03c2; \n but this name they would apply rather to the life of Ananis, a man who, as far as\n real glory is concerned, is totally unknown. Nor would one call the life of the\n heroes who fought against Troy \u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03c2; but they would speak in that way much more of the men of the\n present time; and naturally enough. For the lives of those men were destitute of\n any luxurious preparation, and, as I might almost say, had no seasoning to them,\n inasmuch as at that time there was no commercial intercourse between nations, nor\n were the arts of refinement carried to any degree of accuracy; but the life of men\n of the present day is planned with entire reference to laziness, and enjoyment,\n and to all sorts of pastimes. \n ","3":"\n But Plato, in his Philebus, says\u2014 Pleasure is the most insolent of all\n things; and, as it is reported, in amatory enjoyments, which are said to be the\n most powerful of all, even perjury has been pardoned by the Gods, as if\n pleasure was like a child, incapable of distinguishing between right and\n wrong. And in the eighth book of his Polity, the same Plato has\n previously dilated upon the doctrine so much pressed by the Epicureans, that, of\n the desires, some are natural but not necessary, and others neither natural nor\n necessary, writing thus\u2014 Is not the desire to eat enough for health and\n strength of body, and for bread and meat to that extent, a necessary desire?\u2014I\n think it is.\u2014At all events, the desire for food for these two purposes is\n necessary, inasmuch as it is salutary, and inasmuch as it is able to remove\n hunger? \u2014No doubt.\u2014And the desire for meat, too, is a necessary desire, if it\n at all contributes to a good habit of body?\u2014 Most undoubtedly.\u2014What, then, are\n we to say? Is no desire which goes beyond the appetite for this kind of food,\n and for other food similar to it, and which, if it is checked in young people,\n can be entirely stifled, and which is injurious also to the body, and injurious\n also to the mind, both as far as its intellectual powers are concerned, and\n also as to its temperance, entitled to be called a necessary one?\u2014Most\n certainly not. \n \n ","4":"\n But Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, speaks as follows\u2014\u201cTyrants\n and kings, having all kinds of good things in their power, and having had\n experience of all things, place pleasure in the first rank, on the ground that\n pleasure makes the nature of man more magnanimous. Accordingly, all those who have\n honoured pleasure above everything, and who have deliberately chosen to live a\n life of luxury, have been magnanimous and magnificent people, as, for instance, the Medes and the Persians. For they, of all\n men, are those who hold pleasure and luxury in the highest honour; and they, at\n the same time, are the most valiant and magnanimous of all the barbarians. For to\n indulge in pleasure and luxury is the conduct of freeborn men and of a liberal\n disposition. For pleasure relaxes the soul and invigorates it. But labour belongs\n to slaves and to mean men; on which account they are contracted in their natural\n dispositions. And the city of the Athenians, while it indulged in luxury, was a\n very great city, and bred very magnanimous men. For they wore purple garments, and\n were clad in embroidered tunics; and they bound up their hair in knots, and wore\n golden grasshoppers over their foreheads and in their hair: and their slaves\n followed them, bearing folding chairs for them, in order that, if they wished to\n sit down, they might not be without some proper seat, and forced to put up with\n any chance seat. And these men were such heroes, that they conquered in the battle\n of Marathon, and they alone worsted the power of combined Asia. And all those who\n are the wisest of men, and who have the greatest reputation for wisdom, think\n pleasure the greatest good, Simonides certainly does when he says\u2014 \n For what kind of human life \n Can be worth desiring, \n If pleasure be denied to it? \n What kingly power even? \n Without pleasure e'en the gods \n Have nothing to be envied for. \n And Pindar, giving advice to Hiero the tyrant of Syracuse, says\u2014 \n Never obscure fair pleasure in your life; \n A life of pleasure is the best for man. \n And Homer, too, speaks of pleasure and indulgence in the following terms\u2014\n \n How sweet the products of a peaceful reign,\u2014 \n The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain, \n The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast, \n A loud rejoicing, and a people blest! \n How goodly seems it ever to employ \n Man's social days in union and in joy; \n The plenteous board high heap'd with cates divine, \n And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine. \n \n And again, he calls the gods living at ease. \n And at ease certainly means without labour; as if he\n meant to show by this expression, that the greatest of all evils is labour and\n trouble in life. \n ","5":"\n On which account Megaclides finds fault with those poets who came after Homer and\n Hesiod, and have written about Hercules, relating how he led armies and took\n cities,\u2014 who passed the greater part of his life among men in the most excessive\n pleasure, and married a greater number of women than any other man; and who had\n unacknowledged children, by a greater number of virgins, than any other man. For\n any one might say to those who do not admit all this\u2014\u201cWhence, my good friends, is\n it that you attribute to him all this excessive love of eating; or whence is it\n that the custom has originated among men of leaving nothing in the cup when we\n pour a libation to Hercules, if he had no regard for pleasure? or why are the hot\n springs which rise out of the ground universally said to be sacred to Hercules; or\n why are people in the habit of calling soft couches the beds of Hercules, if he\n despised all those who live luxuriously? Accordingly, says he, the later poets\n represent him as going about in the guise of a robber by himself, having a club,\n and a lion's hide, and his bow. And they say that Stesichorus of Himera was the\n original inventor of this fable. But Xanthus the lyric poet, who was more ancient\n than Stesichorus, as Stesichorus himself tells us, does not, according to the\n statement of Megaclides, clothe him in this dress, but in that which Homer gives\n him. But Stesichorus perverted a great many of the accounts given by Xanthus, as\n he does also in the case of what is called the Orestea. But Antisthenes, when he\n said that pleasure was a good, added\u2014 such as brought no repentance in its\n train. \n \n ","6":"\n But Ulysses, in Homer, appears to have been the original guide to Epicurus, in the\n matter of that pleasure which he has always in his mouth; for Ulysses says to\n Alcinous\u2014 \n . . . . . . . . Thou whom first in sway, \n As first in virtue, these thy realms obey, \n How goodly seems it ever to employ \n Man's social days in union and in joy I \n The plenteous board high heap'd with cates divine, \n And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine, \n \n The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast, \n Are of all joys most lasting and the best. \n But Megaclides says that Ulysses is here adapting himself to the times,\n for the sake of appearing to be of the same disposition as the Ph\u00e6acians; and that\n with that view he embraces their luxurious habits, as he had already heard from\n Alcinous, speaking of his whole nation\u2014 \n To dress, to dance, to sing, our sole delight, \n The feast or bath by day, and love by night; \n for he thought that that would be the only way by which he could avoid\n failing in the hopes he cherished. And a similar man is he who recommends\n Amphilochus his son\u2014 \n Remember thou, my son, to always dwell \n In every city cherishing a mind \n Like to the skin of a rock-haunting fish; \n And always with the present company \n Agree, but when away you can change your mind. \n And Sophocles speaks in a like spirit, in the Iphigenia\u2014 \n As the wise polypus doth quickly change \n His hue according to the rocks he's near, \n So change your mind and your apparent feelings. \n And Theognis says\u2014 \n Imitate the wary cunning of the polypus. \n And some say that Homer was of this mind, when he often prefers the\n voluptuous life to the virtuous one, saying\u2014 \n And now Olympus' shining gates unfold; \n The Gods with Jove assume their thrones of gold; \n Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine, \n The golden goblet crowns with purple wine; \n While the full bowl flows round the Powers employ \n Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy. \n And the same poet represents Menelaus as saying\u2014 \n Nor then should aught but death have torn apart \n From me so loving and so glad a heart. \n And in another place\u2014 \n We sat secure, while fast around did roll \n The dance, and jest, and ever-flowing bowl. \n And in the same spirit Ulysses, at the court of Alcinous, represents\n luxury and wantonness as the main end of life. \n ","7":"\n But of all nations the Persians were the first to become notorious for their\n luxury; and the Persian kings even spent their winters at Susa and their summers\n at Ecbatana. And Aristocles and Chares say that Susa derives\n its name from the seasonable and beautiful character of the place: for that what\n the Greeks call the lily, is called in the Persian language \u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd. But they pass their autumns in Persepolis; and the rest of\n the year they spend in Babylon. And in like manner the kings of the Parthians\n spend their spring in Rhag\u00e6, and their winter in Babylon, and the rest of the year\n at Hecatompylus. And even the very thing which the Persian monarchs used to wear\n on their heads, showed plainly enough their extreme devotion to luxury. For it was\n made, according to the account of Dinon, of myrrh and of something called labyzus.\n And the labyzus is a sweet-smelling plant, and more valuable than myrrh. And\n whenever, says Dinon, the king dismounts from his chariot, he does not jump down,\n however small the height from the chariot to the ground may be, nor is he helped\n down, leaning on any one's hand, but a golden chair is always put by him, and he\n gets on that to descend; on which account the king's chairbearer always follows\n him. And three hundred women are his guard, as Heraclides of Cum\u00e6 relates, in the\n first book of his history of Persia. And they sleep all day, that they may watch\n all night; and they pass the whole night in singing and playing, with lights\n burning. And very often the king takes pleasure with them in the hall of the\n Melophori. The Melophori are one of his troops of guards, all Persians by birth,\n having golden apples ( \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b1 ) on the points of their\n spears, a thousand in number, all picked men out of the main body of ten thousand\n Persians who are called the Immortals. And the king used to go on foot through\n this hall, very fine Sardian carpets being spread in his road, on which no one but\n the king ever trod. And when he came to the last hall, then he mounted a chariot,\n but sometimes he mounted a horse; but on foot he was never seen outside of his\n palace. And if he went out to hunt, his concubines also went with him. And the\n throne on which he used to sit, when he was transacting business, was made of\n gold; and it was surrounded by four small pillars made of gold, inlaid with\n precious stones, and on them there was spread a purple cloth richly\n embroidered. \n ","8":"\n But Clearchus the Solensian, in the fourth book of his Lives, having previously\n spoken about the luxury of the Medes, and having said that on\n this account they made eunuchs of many citizens of the neighbouring tribes, adds,\n that the institution of the Melophori was adopted by the Persians from\n the Medes, being not only a revenge for what they had suffered themselves, but\n also a memorial of the luxury of the bodyguards, to indicate to what pitch of\n effeminacy they had come. For, as it seems, the unseasonable and superfluous\n luxury of their daily life could make even the men who are armed with spears,\n mere mountebanks. And a little further on he says\u2014 And\n accordingly, while he gave to all those who could invent him any new kind of\n food, a prize for their invention, he did not, while loading them with honours,\n allow the food which they had invented to be set before them, but enjoyed it\n all by himself, and thought this was the greatest wisdom. For this, I imagine,\n is what is called the brains of Jupiter and of a king at the same time. \n \n But Chares of Mitylene, in the fifth book of his History of Alexander,\n says\u2014 The Persian kings had come to such a pitch of luxury, that at the\n head of the royal couch there was a supper-room laid with five couches, in\n which there were always kept five thousand talents of gold; and this was called\n the king's pillow. And at his feet was another supper-room, prepared with three\n couches, in which there were constantly kept three thousand talents of silver;\n and this was called the king's footstool. And in his bed-chamber there was also\n a golden vine, inlaid with precious stones, above the king's bed. And\n this vine, Amyntas says in his Posts, had bunches of grapes, composed of most\n valuable precious stones; and not far from it there was placed a golden bowl, the\n work of Theodorus of Samos. And Agathocles, in the third book of his History of\n Cyzicus, says, that there is also among the Persians a water called the golden\n water, and that it rises in seventy springs; and that no one ever drinks of it but\n the king alone, and the eldest of his sons. And if any one else drinks of it, the\n punishment is death. \n ","9":"\n But Xenophon, in the eighth book of his Cyrop\u00e6dia, says\u2014 They still used at\n that time to practise the discipline of the Persians, but the dress and\n effeminacy of the Medes. But now they disregard the sight of the ancient\n Persian bravery becoming extinct, and they are solicitous only to preserve the\n effeminacy of the Medes. And I think it a good opportunity\n to give an account of their luxurious habits. For, in the first place, it is\n not enough for them to have their beds softly spread, but they put even the\n feet of their couches upon carpets in order that the floor may not present\n resistance to them, but that the carpets may yield to their pressure. And as\n for the things which are dressed for their table, nothing is omitted which has\n been discovered before, and they are also continually inventing something new;\n and the same is the way with all other delicacies. For they retain men whose\n sole business it is to invent things of this kind. And in winter it is not\n enough for them to have their head, and their body, and their feet covered, but\n on even the tips of their fingers they wear shaggy gloves and finger-stalls;\n and in summer they are not satisfied with the shade of the trees and of the\n rocks, but they also have men placed in them to contrive additional means of\n producing shade. And in the passage which follows this one, he proceeds\n to say\u2014 But now they have more clothes laid upon their horses than they have\n even on their beds. For they do not pay so much attention to their horsemanship\n as to sitting softly. Moreover, they have porters, and bread-makers, and\n confectioners, and cup-bearers, and men to serve up their meals and to take\n them away, and men to lull them to sleep and men to wake them, and dressers to\n anoint them and to rub them, and to get them up well in every respect. \n \n ","10":"\n The Lydians, too, went to such a pitch of luxury, that they were the first to\n castrate women, as Xanthus the Lydian tells us, or whoever else it was who wrote\n the History which is attributed to him, whom Artemon of Cassandra, in his treatise\n on the Collection of Books, states to have been Pionysius who was surnamed\n Leather-armed; but Artemon was not aware that Ephorus the historian mentions him\n as being an older man than the other, and as having been the man who supplied\n Herodotus with some of his materials. Xanthus, then, in the second book of his\n Affairs of Lydia, says that Adramyttes, the king of the Lydians, was the first man\n who ever castrated women, and used female eunuchs instead of male eunuchs. But\n Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says\u2014\u201cThe Lydians, out of luxury, made\n parks; and having planted them like gardens, made them very shady, thinking it a\n refinement in luxury if the sun never touched them with its rays at all; and at\n last they carried their insolence to such a height, that they\n used to collect other men's wives and maidens into a place that, from this\n conduct, got the name of Hagneon, and there ravished them. And at last, having\n become utterly effeminate, they lived wholly like women instead of like men; on\n which account their age produced even a female tyrant, in the person of one of\n those who had been ravished in this way, by name Omphale. And she was the first to\n inflict on the Lydians the punishment that they deserved. For to be governed and\n insulted by a woman is a sufficient proof of the severity with which they were\n treated. Accordingly she, being a very intemperate woman herself, and meaning to\n revenge the insults to which she herself had been subjected, gave the maiden\n daughters of the masters to their slaves, in the very same place in which she\n herself had been ravished. And then having forcibly collected them all in this\n place, she shut up the mistresses with their slaves. \n On which account the Lydians, wishing to soften the bitterness of the transaction,\n call the place the Woman's Contest \u2014the Sweet Embrace. And not only were the wives\n of the Lydians exposed to all comers, but those also of the Epizephyrian Locrians,\n and also those of the Cyprians\u2014and, in fact, those of all the nations who devote\n their daughters to the lives of prostitutes; and it appears to be, in truth, a\n sort of reminding of, and revenge for, some ancient insult. So against her a\n Lydian man of noble birth rose up, one who had been previously offended at the\n government of Midas; while Midas lay in effeminacy, and luxury, and a purple robe,\n working in the company of the women at the loom. But as Omphale slew all the\n strangers whom she admitted to her embraces, he chastised both-the one, being a\n stupid and illiterate man, he dragged out by his ears; a man who, for want of\n sense, had the surname of the most stupid of all animals: but the woman . . . .\n . \n ","11":"\n And the Lydians were also the first people to introduce the use of the sauce\n called caruca; concerning the preparation of which all those who have written\n cookery books have spoken a good deal-namely, Glaucus the Locrian, and Mith\u00e6cus,\n and Dionysius, and the two Heraclid\u00e6 (who were by birth Syracusans), and Agis, and\n Ep\u00e6netus, and Dionysius, and also Hegesippus, and Erasistratus, and Euthydemus,\n and Criton; and besides these, Stephanus, and Archytas, and\n Acestius, and Acesias, and Diocles, and Philistion; for I know that all these men\n have written cookery books. And the Lydians, too, used to speak of a dish which\n they called candaulus; and there was not one kind of candaulus only, but three, so\n wholly devoted were they to luxury. And Hegesippus the Tarentine says, that the\n candaulus is made of boiled meat, and grated bread, and Phrygian cheese, and\n aniseed, and thick broth: and it is mentioned by Alexis, in his Woman Working all\n Night, or The Spinners; and it is a cook who is represented as speaking:\u2014 \n \n A. And, besides this, we now will serve you up \n A dish whose name's candaulus. \n \n B. I've ne'er tasted \n Candaulus, nor have I e'er heard of it. \n \n A. 'Tis a most grand invention, and 'tis mine; \n And if I put a dish of it before you, \n Such will be your delight that you'll devour \n Your very fingers ere you lose a bit of it. \n We here will get some balls of snow-white wool. \n You will serve up an egg well shred, and twice \n Boil'd till it's hard; a sausage, too, of honey; \n Some pickle from the frying-pan, some slices \n Of new-made Cynthian cheese; and then \n A bunch of grapes, steep'd in a cup of wine: \n But this part of the dish is always laugh'd at, \n And yet it is the mainstay of the meal. \n \n B. Laugh on, my friend; but now be off, I beg, \n With all your talk about candauli, and \n Your sausages, and dishes, and such luxuries. \n Philemon also mentions the candaulus in his Passer-by, where he says\u2014\n \n For I have all these witnesses in the city, \n That I'm the only one can dress a sausage, \n A candaulus, eggs, a thrium, all in no time: \n Was there any error or mistake in this? \n And Nicostratus, in his Cook, says\u2014 \n A man who could not even dress black broth, \n But only thria and candauli. \n And Menander, in his Trophonius, says\u2014 \n Here comes a very rich Ionian, \n And so I make a good thick soup, and eke \n A rich candaulus, amatory food. \n And the Lydians, when going out to war, array themselves to the tune of flutes and pipes, as Herodotus says; and the\n Laced\u00e6monians also attack their enemies keeping time to their flutes, as the\n Cretans keep time to the lyre. \n ","12":"\n But Heraclides of Cum\u00e6, who wrote the History of Persia, having said in his book\n entitled The Preparation, that in the country which produces frankincense the king\n is independent, and responsible to no one, proceeds as follows:\u2014 And he\n exceeds every one in luxury and indolence; for he stays for ever in his palace,\n passing his whole life in luxury and extravagance; and he does no single thing,\n nor does he see many people. But he appoints the judges, and if any one thinks\n that they have decided unjustly, there is a window in the highest part of the\n palace, and it is fastened with a chain: accordingly, he who thinks that an\n unjust decision has been given against him, takes hold of the chain, and drags\n the window; and when the king hears it, he summons the man, and hears the cause\n himself. And if the judges appear to have decided unjustly, they are put to\n death; but if they appear to have decided justly, then the man who has moved\n the window is put to death. And it is said that the sum expended every\n day on the king, and on his wives and friends, amounts to fifteen Babylonian\n talents. \n ","13":"\n And among the Tyrrhenians, who carry their luxury to an extraordinary pitch,\n Tim\u00e6us, in his first book, relates that the female servants wait on the men in a\n state of nudity. And Theopompus, in the forty-third book of his History, states,\n that it is a law among the Tyrrhenians that all their women should be in\n common: and that the women pay the greatest attention to their persons, and\n often practise gymnastic exercises, naked, among the men, and sometimes with\n one another; for that it is not accounted shameful for them to be seen naked.\n And that they sup not with their own husbands, but with any one who happens to\n be present; and they pledge whoever they please in their cups: and that they\n are wonderful women to drink, and very and some. And that the Tyrrhenians bring\n up all the children that are born, no one knowing to what father each child\n belongs: and the children, too, live in the same manner as those who have\n brought them up, having feasts very frequently, ad being intimate with all the\n women. Nor is it reckoned among the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do\n or suffer anything in the open air, or to be seen while it\n is going on; for it is quite the custom of their country: and they are so far\n from thinking it disgraceful, that they even say, when the master of the house\n is indulging his appetites, and any one asks for him, that he is doing so and\n so, using the coarsest possible words for his occupation. But when they are\n together in parties of companions or relations, they act in the following\n manner. First of all, when they have stopped drinking, and are about to go to\n sleep, while the lights are still burning, the servants introduce sometimes\n courtesans, and sometimes beautiful boys, and sometimes women; and when they\n have enjoyed them, they proceed to acts of still grosser licentiousness: and\n they indulge their appetites, and make parties on purpose, sometimes keeping\n one another in sight, but more frequently making tents around the beds, which\n are made of plaited laths, with cloths thrown over them. And the objects of\n their love are usually women; still they are not invariably as particular as\n they might be; and they are very beautiful, as is natural for people to be who\n live delicately, and who take great care of their persons. \n \n And all the barbarians who live towards the west, smooth their bodies by rubbing\n them with pitch, and by shaving them; and among the Tyrrhenians there are many\n shops in which this trade is practised, and many artists whose sole employment it\n is, just as there are barbers among us. And when the Tyrrhenians go to these men,\n they give themselves wholly up to them, not being ashamed of having spectators, or\n of those who may be passing by. And many of the Greeks, and of those who inhabit\n Italy, adopt this practice, having learnt it from the Samnites and Messapians. But\n the Tyrrhenians (as Alcimus relates) are so far gone in luxury, that they even\n make bread, and box, and flog people to the sound of the flute. \n ","14":"\n The tables of the Sicilians also are very notorious for their luxury. And\n they say that even the sea in their region is sweet, delighting in the food\n which is procured from it, as Clearchus says, in the fifth book of his\n Lives. And why need we mention the Sybarites, among whom bathing men and pourers\n of water were first introduced in fetters, in order to prevent their going too\n fast, and to prevent also their scalding the bathers in their haste? And the Sybarites were the first people to forbid those who practise\n noisy arts from dwelling in their city; such as braziers, and smiths, and\n carpenters, and men of similar trades; providing that their slumbers should always\n be undisturbed. And it used to be unlawful to rear a cock in their city. \n And Tim\u00e6us relates concerning them, that a citizen of Sybaris once going into the\n country, seeing the husbandmen digging, said that he himself felt as if he had\n broker his bones by the sight; and some one who heard him replied, I, when\n I heard you say this, felt as if I had a pain in my side. And once, at\n Crotona, some Sybarites were standing by some one of the athletes who was digging\n up dust for the pal\u00e6stra, and said they marvelled that men who had such a city had\n no slaves to dig the pal\u00e6stra for them. But another Sybarite, coming to Laced\u00e6mon,\n and being invited to the phiditium, sitting down on a wooden seat and eating with\n them, said that originally he had been surprised at hearing of the valour of the\n Laced\u00e6monians; but that now that he had seen it, he thought that they in no\n respect surpassed other men: for that the greatest coward on earth would rather\n die a thousand times than live and endure such a life as theirs. \n ","15":"\n And it is a custom among them that even their children, up to the age when they\n are ranked among the ephebi, should wear purple robes, and curls braided with\n gold. And it is a custom with them also to breed up in their houses little\n mannikins and dwarfs (as Timon says) who are called by some people \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bb\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2; and also little Maltese dogs, which follow\n them even to the gymnasia. And it was these men, and men like them, to whom\n Masinissa, king of Mauritania, made answer (as Ptolemy relates, in the eighth book\n of his Commentaries), when they were seeking to buy some monkeys: Why,\u2014do\n not your wives, my good friends, produce any offspring? For Masinissa\n was very fond of children, and kept about him and brought up the children of his\n sons, and of his daughters equally, and he had a great many of them: and he\n brought them all up till they were three years old, and after that he sent them to\n their parent, having the younger ones to take their places. And Eublus the comic\n writer has said the same thing in his Graces:\u2014 \n For is it not, I pray you, better far \n For one man, who can well afford such acts, \n \n To rear a man, than a loud gaping goose, \n Or sparrow, or ape\u2014most mischievous of beasts? \n And Athenodorus, in his treatise on Serious Studies and Amusements, says\n that Archytas of Tarentum, who was both a statesman and a philosopher,\n having many slaves, was always delighted at his entertainments when any of them\n came to his banquets. But the Sybarites delighted only in Maltese puppy dogs,\n and in men which were no men. \n \n ","16":"\n The Sybarites used to wear also garments made of Milesian wool, from which there\n arose a great friendship between the two cities, as Tim\u00e6us relates. For of the\n inhabitants of Italy, the Milesians gave the preference to the Tyrrhenians, and of\n foreigners to the Ionians, because they were devoted to luxury. But the cavalry of\n the Sybarites, being in number more than five thousand, used to go in procession\n with saffron-coloured robes over their breastplates; and in the summer their\n younger men used to go away to the caves of the Lusiades Nymphs, and live there in\n all kinds of luxury. And whenever the rich men of that country left the city for\n the country, although they always travelled in chariots, still they used to\n consume three days in a day's journey. And some of the roads which led to their\n villas in the country were covered with awnings all over; and a great many of them\n had cellars near the sea, into which their wine was brought by canals from the\n country, and some of it was then sold out of the district, but some was brought\n into the city in boats. They also celebrate in public numbers of feasts; and they\n honour those who display great magnificence on such occasions with golden crowns,\n and they proclaim their names at the public sacrifices and games; announcing not\n only their general goodwill towards the city, but also the great magnificence\n which they had displayed in the feasts. And on these occasions they even crown\n those cooks who have served up the most exquisite dishes. And among the Sybarites\n there were found baths in which, while they lay down, they were steamed with warm\n vapours. And they were the first people who introduced the custom of bringing\n chamber-pots into entertainments. But laughing at those who left their countries\n to travel in foreign lands, they themselves used to boast that they had grown old\n without ever having crossed the bridges which led over their frontier rivers. \n \n ","17":"\n But it seems to me, that besides the fact of the riches of the Sybarites, the very\n natural character of their country,\u2014 since there are no harbours on their coasts,\n and since, in consequence, nearly all the produce of the land is consumed by the\n citizens themselves,\u2014and to some extent also an oracle of the God, has excited\n them all to luxury, and has cased them to live in practices of most immoderate\n dissoluteness. But their city lies in a hollow, and in summer is liable to excess\n of cold both morning and evening, but in the middle of the day the heat is\n intolerable, so that the greater part of them believe that the rivers contribute a\n great deal to the health of the inhabitants; on which account it has been said,\n that an man who, living at Sybaris, wishes not to die before his time,\n ought never to see the sun either rise or set. And once they sent to\n the oracle to consult the God (and one of the ambassadors was named Amyris), and\n to ask how long their prosperity should last; and the priestess of Delphi answered\n them\u2014 \n You shall be happy, Sybarite,\u2014very happy, \n And all your time in entertainments pass, \n While you continue to th' immortal gods \n The worship due: but when you come, at length, \n To honour mortal man beyond the gods, \n Then foreign war and intestine sedition \n Shall come upon you, and shall crush your city. \n When they had heard this they thought the God had said to them that they\n should never have their luxury terminated; for that there was no chance of their\n ever honouring a man more than God. But in agreement with the oracle they\n experienced a change of fortune, when one of them flogging one of his slaves,\n continued to beat him after he had sought an asylum in a temple; but when at last\n he fled to the tomb of his father, he let him go, out of shame. But their whole\n revenues were dissipated by the way in which then rivalled one another in luxury.\n And the city also rivalled all other cities in luxury. And not long after this\n circumstance, when many omens of impending destruction, which it is not necessary\n to allude to further at present, had given them notice, they were destroyed. \n ","18":"\n But they had carried their luxury to such a pitch that they had taught even their\n horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute. Accordingly the people\n of Crotona, knowing this, and being at war with them, as\n Aristotle relates in his History of the Constitution of Sybaris, played before\n their horses the air to which they were accustomed to dance; for the people of\n Crotona also had fluteplayers in military uniform. And as soon as the horses heard\n them playing on the flute, they not only began to dance, but ran over to the army\n of the Crotonians, carrying their riders with them. \n And Charon of Lampsacus tells a similar story about the Cardians, in the second\n book of his Annals, writing as follows:\u2014 The Bisalt\u00e6 invaded the territory\n of the Cardians, and conquered them. But the general of the Bisalt\u00e6 was Onaris;\n and he, while he was a boy, had been sold as a slave in Cardia; and having\n lived as a slave to one of the Cardians, he had been taught the trade of a\n barber. And the Cardians had an oracle warning them that the Bisalt\u00e6 would some\n day invade them; and they very often used to talk over this oracle while\n sitting in this barber's shop. And Onaris, escaping from Cardia to his own\n country, prompted the Bisalt\u00e6 to invade the Cardians, and was himself elected\n general of the Bisalt\u00e6. But all the Cardians had been in the habit of teaching\n their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute; and they,\n standing on their hind feet, used to dance with their fore feet in time to the\n airs which they had been taught. Onaris then, knowing these things, got a\n female fluteplayer from among the Cardians. And this female fluteplayer coming\n to the Bisalt\u00e6, taught many of their fluteplayers; and when they had learnt\n sufficiently, he took them in his army against the Cardians. And when the\n battle took place, he ordered the fluteplayers to play the airs which they had\n learnt, and which the horses of the Cardians knew. And when the horses heard\n the flute, they stood up on their hind feet, and took to dancing. But the main\n strength of the Cardians was in their cavalry, and so they were\n conquered. \n \n And one of the Sybarites, once wishing to sail over to Crotona, hired a vessel to\n carry him by himself, on condition that no one was to splash him, and that no one\n else was to be taken on board, and that he might take his horse with him. And when\n the captain of the ship had agreed to these terms, he put his horse on board, and\n ordered some straw to be spread under the horse. And\n afterwards he begged one of those who had accompanied him down to the vessel to go\n with him, saying, I have already stipulated with the captain of the ship to\n keep along the shore. But he relied, I should have had great\n difficulty in complying with your wishes if you had been going to walk along\n the seashore, much less can I do so when you are going to sail along the\n land. \n \n ","19":"\n But Phylarchus, in the twenty-fifth book of his History, (having said that there\n was a law at Syracuse, that the women should not wear golden ornaments, nor\n garments embroidered with flowers, nor robes with purple borders, unless they\n professed that they were public prostitutes; and that there was another law, that\n a man should not adorn his person, nor wear any extraordinarily handsome robes,\n different from the rest of the citizens, unless he meant to confess that he was.\n an adulterer and a profligate: and also, that a freewoman was not to walk abroad\n when the sun had set, unless she was going to commit adultery; and even by day\n they were not allowed to go out without the leave of the regulators of the women,\n and without one female servant following them,)\u2014 Phylarchus, I say, states, that\n the Sybarites, having given loose to their luxury, made a law that women\n might be invited to banquets, and that those who intended to invite them to\n sacred festivities must make preparation a year before, in order that they\n might have all that time to provide themselves with garments and other\n ornaments in a suitable manner worthy of the occasion, and so might come to the\n banquet to which they were invited. And if any confectioner or cook invented\n any peculiar and excellent dish, no other artist was allowed to make this for a\n year; but he alone who invented it was entitled to all the profit to be derived\n from the manufacture of it for that time; in order that others might be in-\n duced to labour at excelling in such pursuits. And the same way, it was\n provided that those who sold eels were not to be liable to pay tribute, nor\n those who caught them either. And in the same way the laws exempted from all\n burdens those who dyed the marine purple and those who imported it. \n \n ","20":"\n They, then, having carried their luxury and insolence to a great height, at last,\n when thirty ambassadors came to them from the people of Crotona, slew them all,\n and threw their bodies down over the wall, and left them\n there to be eaten by beasts. And this was the beginning of great evils to them, as\n the Deity was much offended at it. Accordingly, a few days afterwards all their\n chief magistrates appeared to see the same vision on one night; for they thought\n that they saw Juno coming into the midst of the market-place, and vomiting gall;\n and a spring of blood arose in her temple. But even then they did not desist from\n their arrogance, until they were all destroyed by the Crotonians. But Heraclides\n of Pontus, in his treatise on Justice, says,\u2014 The Sybarites having put down\n the tyranny of Telys, and having destroyed all those who had exercised\n authority, met them and slew them at the altars of the gods. And at the sight\n of this slaughter the statue of Juno turned itself away, and the floor sent up\n a fountain of blood, so that they were forced to cover all the place around\n with brazen tablets, wishing to stop the rising of the blood: on which account\n they were all driven from their city and destroyed. And they had also been\n desirous to obscure the glory of the famous games at Olympia; for watching the\n time when they are celebrated, they attempted to draw over the athletes to\n their side by the extravagance of the prizes which they offered. \n \n ","21":"\n And the men of Crotona, as Tim\u00e6us says, after they had destroyed the people of\n Sybaris, began to indulge in luxury; so that their chief magistrate went about the\n city clad in a purple robe, and wearing a golden crown on his head, and wearing\n also white sandals. But some say that this was not done out of luxury, but owing\n to Democedes the physician, who was by birth a native of Crotona; and who having\n lived with Polycrates the tyrant of Samos, and having been taken prisoner by the\n Persians after his death, was taken to the king of Persia, after Or\u0153tes had put\n Polycrates to death. And Democedes, having cured Atossa, the wife of Darius, and\n daughter of Cyrus, who had a complaint in her breast, asked of her this reward, to\n be sent back to Greece, on condition of returning again to Persia; and having\n obtained his request he came to Crotona. And as he wished to remain there, when\n some Persian laid hold of him and said that he was a slave of the king of Persia,\n the Crotonians took him away, and having stripped the Persian of his robe, dressed\n the lictor of their chief magistrate in it. And from that\n time forward, the lictor, having on the Persian robe, went round with the chief\n magistrate to all the altars every seventh day; not for the sake of luxury or\n insolence, but doing it for the purpose of insulting the Persians. But after this\n the men of Crotona, as Tim\u00e6us says, attempted to put an end to the Assembly at\n Olympia, by appointing a meeting for games, with enormously rich prizes, to be\n held at exactly the same time as the Olympian games; but some say that the\n Sybarites did this. \n ","22":"\n But Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says that the people of Tarentum,\n being a very valiant and powerful people, carried their luxury to such a height,\n that they used to make their whole body smooth, and that they were the first\n people who set other nations an example of this smoothness. They also, says he,\n all wore very beautiful fringes on their garments; such as those with which now\n the life of woman is refined. And afterwards, being led on by their luxury to\n insolence, they overthrew a city of the Iapyges, called Carbina, and collected all\n the boys and maidens, and women in the flower of their age, out of it into the\n temples of the Carbinians; and building tents there, they exposed them naked by\n day for all who chose to come and look at them, so that whoever pleased, leaping,\n as it were, on this unfortunate band, might satiate his appetites with the beauty\n of those who were there assembled, in the sight of every one, and above all of the\n Gods, whom they were thinking of but little. And this aroused the indignation of\n the Deity, so that he struck all the Tarentines who behaved so impiously in\n Carbina with his thunderbolts. And even to this day at Tarentum every one of the\n houses has the same number of pillars before its doors as that of the people whom\n it received back of those who were sent to Iapygia. And, when the day comes which\n is the anniversary of their death, they do not bewail those who perished at those\n pillars, nor do they offer the libations which are customary in other cases, but\n they offer sacrifices to Jupiter the Thunderer. \n ","23":"\n Now the race of the Iapygians came originally from Crete, being descended from\n those Cretans who came to seek for Glaucus, and settled in that part of Italy; but\n afterwards, they, forgetting the orderly life of the Cretans came to such a pitch\n of luxury, and from thence to such a degree of insolence,\n that they were the first people who painted their faces, and who wore headbands\n and false hair, and who clothed themselves in robes embroidered with flowers, and\n who considered it disgraceful to cultivate the land, or to do any kind of labour.\n And most of them made their houses more beautiful than the temples of the gods;\n and so they say, that the leaders of the Iapygians, treating the Deity with\n insult, destroyed the images of the gods out of the temples, ordering them to give\n place to their superiors. On which account, being struck with fire and\n thunderbolts, they gave rise to this report; for indeed the thunderbolts with\n which they were stricken down were visible a long time afterwards. And to this\n very day all their descendants live with shaven heads and in mourning apparel, in\n want of all the luxuries which previously belonged to them. \n ","24":"\n But the Spaniards, although they go about in robes like those of the tragedians,\n and richly embroidered, and in tunics which reach down to the feet, are not at all\n hindered by their dress from displaying their vigour in war; but the people of\n Massilia became very effeminate, wearing the same highly ornamented kind of dress\n which the Spaniards used to wear; but they behave in a shameless manner, on\n account of the effeminacy of their souls, behaving like women, out of luxury: from\n which the proverb has gone about,\u2014May you sail to Massilia. And the inhabitants of\n Siris, which place was first inhabited by people who touched there on their return\n from Troy, and after them by the Colophonians, as Tim\u00e6us and Aristotle tell us,\n indulged in luxury no less than the Sybarites; for it was a peculiar national\n custom of theirs to wear embroidered tunics, which they girded up with expensive\n girdles ( \u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 ); and on this account they were\n called by the inhabitants of the adjacent countries \u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03af\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, since Homer calls those who have no girdles \u1f00\u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03af\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. And Archilochus the poet marvelled beyond\n anything at the country of the Siritans, and at their prosperity. Accordingly,\n speaking of Thasos as inferior to Siris, he says\u2014 \n For there is not on earth a place so sweet, \n Or lovely, or desirable as that \n Which stands upon the stream of gentle Siris. \n But the place was called Siris, as Tim\u00e6us asserts, and as Euripides says\n too in his play called The Female Prisoner, or Melanippe,\n from a woman named Siris, but according to Archilochus, from a river of the same\n name. And the number of the population was very great in proportion to the size of\n the place and extent of the country, owing to the luxurious and delicious\n character of the climate all around. On which account nearly all that part of\n Italy which was colonised by the Greeks was called Magna Gr\u00e6cia. \n ","25":"\n \n But the Milesians, as long as they abstained from luxury, conquered the\n Scythians, as Ephorus says, \"and founded all the cities on the\n Hellespont, and settled all the country about the Euxine Sea with beautiful\n cities. And they all betook themselves to Miletus. But when they were enervated by\n pleasure and luxury, all the valiant character of the city disappeared, as\n Aristotle tells us; and indeed a proverb arose from them,\u2014 \n Once on a time Milesians were brave.\" \n Heraclides of Pontus, in the second book of his treatise on Justice,\n says,\u2014\"The city of the Milesians fell into misfortunes, on account of the\n luxurious lives of the citizens and on account of the political factions; for the\n citizens, not loving equity, destroyed their enemies root and branch. For all the\n rich men and the populace formed opposite factions (and they call the populace\n Gergith\u00e6). At first the people got the better, and drove out the rich men, and,\n collecting the children of those who fled into some threshing-floors, collected a\n lot of oxen, and so trampled them to death, destroying them in a most impious\n manner. Therefore, when in their turn the rich men got the upper hand, they\n smeared over all those whom they got into their power with pitch, and so burnt\n them alive. And when they were being burnt, they say that many other prodigies\n were seen, and also that a sacred olive took fire of its own accord; on which\n account the God drove them for a long time from his oracle; and when they asked\n the oracle on what account they were driven away, he said\u2014 \n My heart is grieved for the defenceless Gergith\u00e6, \n So helplessly destroy'd; and for the fate \n Of the poor pitch-clad bands, and for the tree \n Which never more shall flourish or bear fruit. \n And Clearchus, in his fourth book, says that the Milesians, imitating the\n luxury of the Colophonians, disseminated it among their\n neighbours. And then he says that they, when reproved for it, said one to another,\n Keep at home your native Milesian wares, and publish them not. \n \n ","26":"\n And concerning the Scythians, Clearchus, in what follows these last words,\n proceeds to say\u2014-\"The nation of the Scythians was the first to use common laws;\n but after that, they became in their turn the most miserable of all nations, on\n account of their insolence: for they indulged in luxury to a degree in which no\n other nation did, being prosperous in everything, and having great resources of\n all sorts for such indulgences. And this is plain from the traces which exist of\n it to this day in the apparel worn, and way of life practised, by their chief men.\n For they, being very luxurious, and indeed being the first men who abandoned\n themselves wholly to luxury, proceeded to such a pitch of insolence that they used\n to cut off the noses of all the men wherever they came; and their descendants,\n after they emigrated to other countries, even now derive their name from this\n treatment. But their wives used to tattoo the wives of the Thracians, (of those\n Thracians, that is, who lived on the northern and western frontiers of Scythia,)\n all over their bodies, drawing figures on them with the tongues of their buckles;\n on which account, many years afterwards, the wives of the Thracians who had been\n treated in this manner effaced this disgrace in a peculiar manner of their own,\n tattooing also all the rest of their skin all over, in order that by this means\n the brand of disgrace and insult which was imprinted on their bodies, being\n multiplied in so various a manner, might efface the reproach by being called an\n ornament. And they lorded it over all other nations in so tyrannical a manner,\n that the offices of slavery, which are painful enough to all men, made it plain to\n all succeeding ages what was the real character of a Scythian\n command. \n \n Therefore, on account of the number of disasters which oppressed them, since every\n people had lost, through grief, all the comforts of life, and all their hair at\n the same time, foreign nations called all cutting of the hair which is done by way\n of insult, \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n ","27":"\n And Callias, or Diocles, (whichever was the author of the Cyclopes), ridiculing\n the whole nation of the Ionians in that play, says\u2014 \n \n What has become of that luxurious \n Ionia, with the sumptuous supper-tables? \n Tell me, how does it fare? \n And the people of Abydus (and Abydus is a colony of Miletus) are very\n luxurious in their way of life, and wholly enervated by pleasure; as Hermippus\n tells us, in his Soldiers\u2014 \n \n A. I do rejoice when I behold an army \n From o'er the sea,\u2014to see how soft they are \n And delicate to view, with flowing hair, \n And well-smooth'd muscles in their tender arms. \n \n B. Have you heard Abydus has become a man? \n And Aristophanes, in his Triphales, ridiculing (after the fashion of the\n comedians) many of the Ionians, says\u2014 \n Then all the other eminent foreigners \n Who were at hand, kept following steadily, \n And much they press'd him, begging he would take \n The boy with him to Chios, and there sell him: \n Another hoped he'd take him to Clazomen\u00e6; \n A third was all for Ephesus; a fourth \n Preferred Abydus on the Hellespont: \n And all these places in his way did lie. \n But concerning the people of Abydus, Antipho, in reply to the attacks of\n Alcibiades, speaks as follows:\u2014 After you had been considered by your\n guardians old enough to be your own master, you, receiving your property from\n their hands, went away by sea to Abydus,\u2014not for the purpose of transacting any\n private business of your own, nor on account of any commission of the state\n respecting any public rights of hospitality; but, led only by your own lawless\n and intemperate disposition, to learn lascivious habits and actions from the\n women at Abydus, in order that you might be able to put them in practice during\n the remainder of your life. \n \n ","28":"\n The Magnesians also, who lived on the banks of the Meander, were undone because\n they indulged in too much luxury, as Callinus relates in his Elegies; and\n Archilochus confirms this: for the city of Magnesia was taken by the Ephesians.\n And concerning these same Ephesians, Democritus, who was himself an Ephesian,\n speaks in the First book of his treatise on the Temple of Diana at Ephesus; where,\n relating their excessive effeminacy, and the dyed garments which they used to\n wear, he uses these expressions:\u2014 And as for the violet and purple robes of\n the Ionians, and their saffron garments, embroidered with\n round figures, those are known to every one; and the caps which they wear on\n their heads are in like manner embroidered with figures of animals. They wear\n also garments called sarapes, of yellow, or scarlet, or white, and some even of\n purple: and they wear also long robes called calasires, of Corinthian\n workmanship; and some of these are purple, and some violet-coloured, and some\n hyacinth-coloured; and one may also see some which are of a fiery red, and\n others which are of a sea-green colour. There are also Persian calasires, which\n are the most beautiful of all. And one may see also, continues\n Democritus, the garments which they call act\u00e6\u00e6; and the act\u00e6a is the most\n costly of all the Persian articles of dress: and this act\u00e6a is woven for the\n sake of fineness and of strength, and it is ornamented all over with golden\n millet-grains; and all the millet-grains have knots of purple thread passing\n through the middle, to fasten them inside the garment. And he says that\n the Ephesians use all these things, being wholly devoted to luxury. \n ","29":"\n But Duris, speaking concerning the luxury of the Samians, quotes the poems of\n Asius, to prove that they used to wear armlets on their arms; and that, when\n celebrating the festival of the Her\u00e6a, they used to go about with their hair\n carefully combed down over the back of their head and over their shoulders; and he\n says that this is proved to have been their regular practice by this\n proverb\u2014 To go, like a worshipper of Juno, with his hair braided. \n \n Now the verses of Asius run as follows:\u2014- \n And they march'd, with carefully comb'd hair \n To the most holy spot of Juno's temple, \n Clad in magnificent robes, whose snow-white folds \n Reach'd to the ground of the extensive earth, \n And golden knobs on them like grasshoppers, \n And golden chaplets loosely held their hair, \n Gracefully waving in the genial breeze; \n And on their arms were armlets, highly wrought, \n . . . . . . . . . and sung \n The praises of the mighty warrior. \n But Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that the\n Samians, being most extravagantly luxurious, destroyed the city, out of their\n meanness to one another, as effectually as the Sybarites destroyed theirs. \n ","30":"\n But the Colophonians (as Phylarchus says), who ori- ginally\n adopted a very rigid course of life, when, in conse- quence of the alliance and\n friendship which they formed with the Lydians, they began to give way to luxury,\n used to go into public with their hair adorned with golden ornaments, as\n Xenophanes tells us\u2014 \n They learnt all sorts of useless foolishness \n From the effeminate Lydians, while they \n Were held in bondage to sharp tyranny. \n They went into the forum richly clad \n In purple garments, in numerous companies, \n Whose strength was not less than a thousand men, \n Boasting of hair luxuriously dress'd, \n Dripping with costly and sweet-smelling oils. \n And to such a degree did they carry their dissoluteness and their\n unseemly drunkenness, that some of them never once saw the sun either rise or set:\n and they passed a law, which continued even to our time, that the female\n fluteplayers and female harpers, and all such musicians and singers, should\n receive pay from daybreak to midday, and until the lamps were lighted; but after\n that they set aside the rest of the night to get drunk in. And Theopompus, in the\n fifteenth book of his History, says, that a thousand men of that city used\n to walk about the city, wearing purple garments, which was at that time a\n colour rare even among kings, and greatly sought after; for purple was\n constantly sold for its weight in silver. And so, owing to these practices,\n they fell under the power of tyrants, and became torn by factions, and so were\n undone with their country. And Diogenes the Babylonian gave the same\n account of them, in the first book of his Laws. And Antiphanes, speaking generally\n of the luxury of all the Ionians, has the following lines in his Dodona:\u2014 \n Say, from what country do you come, what land \n Call you your home? Is this a delicate \n Luxurious band of long and soft-robed men \n From cities of Ionia that here approaches? \n And Theophrastus, in his essay on Pleasure, says that the Ionians, on\n account of the extraordinary height to which they carried their luxury, gave rise\n to what is now known as the golden proverb. \n ","31":"\n And Theopompus, in the eighth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, says\n that some of those tribes which live on the sea-coast are exceedingly luxurious in\n their manner of living. But about the Byzantians and\n Chalcedonians, the same Theopompus makes the following statement:\u2014 But the\n Byzantians, because they had been governed a long time by a democracy, and\n because their city was so situated as to be a kind of mart, and because the\n whole people spent the whole of their time in the market-place and about the\n harbour, were very intemperate, and in the constant habit of feasting and\n drinking at the wine-sellers'. But the Chalcedonians, before they became\n members of the same city with them, were men who at all times cultivated better\n habits and principles of life; but after they had tasted of the democracy of\n the Byzantians, they fell into ruinous luxury, and, from having been most\n temperate and moderate in their daily life, they became a nation of hard\n drinkers, and very extravagant. And, in the twenty-first book of the\n History of the Affairs of Philip, he says that the nation of the Umbrians (and\n that is a tribe which lives on the shores of the Hadriatic) was exceedingly\n devoted to luxury, and lived in a manner very like the Lydians, and had a fertile\n country, owing to which they advanced in prosperity. \n ","32":"\n But speaking about the Thessalians, in his fourth book, he says that they\n spend all their time among dancing women and flute-playing women, and some\n spend all the day in dice and drinking, and similar pastimes; and they are more\n anxious how they may display their tables loaded with all kinds of food, than\n how they may exhibit a regular and orderly life. But the Pharsalians, \n says he, are of all men the most indolent and the most extravagant. \n And the Thessalians are confessed (as Critias says) to be the most extravagant of\n all the Greeks, both in their way of living and in their apparel; which was a\n reason why they conducted the Persians into Greece, desiring to copy their luxury\n and expense. \n But concerning the Aetolians, Polybius tells us, in the thirteenth book of his\n History, that on account of their continual wars, and the extravagance of their\n lives, they became involved in debt. And Agatharchides, in the twelfth book of his\n Histories, says\u2014 The Aetolians are so much the more ready to encounter\n death, in proportion as they seek to live extravagantly and with greater\n prodigality than any other nation. \n \n ","33":"\n But the Sicilians, and especially the Syracusans, are very\n notorious for their luxury; as Aristophanes also tells us, in his Daitaleis, where\n he says\u2014 \n But after that I sent you, you did not \n Learn this at all; but only learnt to drink, \n And sing loose songs at Syracusan feasts, \n And how to share in Sybaritic banquets, \n And to drink Chian wine in Spartan cups. \n But Plato, in his Epistles, says\u2014 It was with this intention that I\n went to Italy and Sicily, when I paid my first visit there. But when I got\n there, the way of life that I found there was not at all pleasing to me; for\n twice in the day they eat to satiety, and they never sleep alone at night; and\n they indulge also in all other such practices as naturally follow on such\n habits: for, after such habits as these, no man in all the world, who has been\n bred up in them from his youth, can possibly turn out sensible; and as for\n being temperate and virtuous, that none of them ever think of. And in\n the third book of his Polity he writes as follows:\u2014\"It seems to me, my friend,\n that you do not approve of the Syracusan tables, and the Sicilian variety of\n dishes; and you do not approve either of men, who wish to preserve a vigorous\n constitution, devoting themselves to Corinthian mistresses; nor do you much admire\n the delicacy which is usually attributed to Athenian sweetmeats. \n ","34":"\n But Posidonius, in the sixteenth book of his Histories, speaking of the cities in\n Syria, and saying how luxurious they were, writes as follows:\u2014 The\n inhabitants of the towns, on account of the great fertility of the land, used\n to derive great revenues from their estates, and after their labours for\n necessary things used to celebrate frequent entertainments, at which they\n feasted incessantly, using their gymnasia for baths, and anointing themselves\n with very costly oils and perfumes; and they passed all their time in their\n \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1, for that was the name which they\n gave to their public banqueting-rooms, as if they had been their own private\n houses; and the greater part of the day they remained in tem, filling their\n bellies with meat and drink, so as even to carry away a good deal to eat at\n home; and they delighted their ears with the music of a noisy lyre, so that\n whole cities resounded with such noises. But Agatharchides, in the\n thirty-fifth book of his Affairs of Europe, says\u2014 The Arycandians of Lycia,\n being neighbours of the Limyres, having got involved in\n debt, on account of the intemperance and extravagance of their way of living,\n and, by reason of their indolence and devotion to pleasure, being unable to\n discharge their debts, placed all their hopes on Mithridates, thinking that he\n would reward them with a general abolition of debts. And, in his\n thirty-first book, he says that the Zacynthians were inexperienced in war, because\n they were accustomed to live in ease and opulence. \n ","35":"\n And Polybius, in his seventh book, says, that the inhabitants of Capua in\n Campania, having become exceedingly rich through the excellence of their soil,\n fell into habits of luxury and extravagance, exceeding all that is reported of the\n inhabitants of Crotona or Sybaris. Accordingly, says he,\n they, not being able to bear their present prosperity, called in\n Hannibal, owing to which act they afterwards suffered intole- rable calamities\n at the hands of the Romans. But the people of Petelia, who kept the promises\n which they had made to the Romans, behaved with such resolution and fortitude\n when besieged by Hannibal, that they did not surrender till they had eaten all\n the hides which there were in the city, and the bark and young branches of all\n the trees which grew in the city, and till they had endured a siege for eleven\n months, without any one coming to their assistance; and they did not even then\n surrender without the permission of the Romans. \n \n ","36":"\n And Phylarchus, in the eleventh book of his History, says that Aeschylus says that\n the Curetes derived their name from their luxurious habits\u2014 \n And their luxurious curls, like a fond girl's, \n On which account they call'd him \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n \n And Agathon in his Thyestes says, that \"the suitors who courted the\n daughter of Pronax came sumptuously dressed in all other points, and also with\n very long, carefully dressed hair. And when they failed in obtaining her hand\u2014\n \n At least (say they) we cut and dress'd our hair, \n To be an evidence of our luxury, \n A lovely action of a cheerful mind; \n And thence we gain'd the glory of a name,\u2014 \n To be \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, from our well-cut ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) hair.\" \n And the people of Cum\u00e6 in Italy, as Hyperochus tells us, or whoever else\n it was who wrote the History of Cum\u00e6 which is attributed to\n him, wore golden brocaded garments all day, and robes embroidered with flowers;\n and used to go to the fields with their wives, riding in chariots.\u2014And this is\n what I have to say about the luxury of nations and cities. \n ","37":"\n But of individual instances I have heard tile following stories:\u2014Ctesias, in the\n third book of his History of Persia, says, that all those who were ever kings in\n Asia devoted themselves mainly to luxury; and above all of them, Ninyas did so,\n the son of Ninus and Semiramis. He, therefore, remaining in-doors and living\n luxuriously, was never seen by any one, except by his eunuchs and by his own\n women. \n And another king of this sort was Sardanapalus, whom some call the son of\n Anacyndaraxes, and others the son of Anabaxarus. And so, when Arbaces, who was one\n of the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to manage, by the\n assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose name was Sparamizus, to see Sardanaplus;\n and when he with difficulty prevailed upon him, with the consent of the king\n himself,\u2014when the Mede entered and saw him, pointed with vermilion and adorned\n like a woman, sitting among his concubines carding purple wool, and sitting among\n them with his feet up, wearing a woman's robe, and with his beard carefully\n scraped, and his face smoothed with pumice-stone (for he was whiter than milk, and\n pencilled under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces, he was just\n putting a little more white under his eyes), most historians, among whom Duris is\n one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by\n such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias says that he went to\n war with him, and collected a great army, and then that Sardanapalus, being\n dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself alive in his palace, having heaped up\n a funeral pile four plethra in extent, on which he placed a hundred and fifty\n golden couches, and a corresponding number of tables, these, too, being all made\n of gold. And he also erected on the funeral pile a chamber a hundred feet long,\n made of wood; and in it he had couches spread, and there he himself lay down with\n his wife, and his concubines lay on other couches around. For he had sent on his\n three sons and his daughters, when he saw that his affairs were getting in a\n dangerous state, to Nineveh, to the king of that city, giving them three thousand\n talents of gold. And he made the roof of this apartment of\n large stout beams, and then all the walls of it he made of numerous thick planks,\n so that it was impossible to escape out of it. And in it he placed ten millions of\n talents of gold, and a hundred millions of talents of silver, and robes, and\n purple garments, and every kind of apparel imaginable. And after that he bade the\n slaves set fire to the pile; and it was fifteen days burning. And those who saw\n the smoke wondered, and thought that he was celebrating a great sacrifice; but the\n eunuchs alone knew what was really being done. And in this way Sardanapalus, who\n had spent his life in extraordinary luxury, died with as much magnanimity as\n possible. \n ","38":"\n But Clearchus, relating the history of the king of Persia, says that\u2014 in a\n very prudent manner he proposed prizes for any one who could invent any\n delicious food. For this is what, I imagine, is meant by the brains of Jupiter\n and the king. On which account, continues he, Sardanapalus was\n the most happy of all monarchs, who during his whole life preferred enjoyment\n to everything else, and who, even after his death, shows by his fingers, in the\n figure carved on his tomb, how much ridicule all human affairs deserve, being\n not worth the snap of his fingers which he makes . . . . . . . . anxiety about\n other things. \n \n However, Sardanapalus does not appear to have lived all his life in entire\n inaction; for the inscription on his tomb says\u2014- \n Sardanapalus \n The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes, \n In one day built Anchiale and Tarsus; \n But now he's dead. \n And Amyntas, in the third book of his Account of the Posts, says that at\n Nineveh there is a very high mound, which Cyrus levelled with the ground when he\n besieged the city, and raised another mound against the city; and that this mound\n was said to have been erected by Sardanapalus the son of King Ninus; and that on\n it there was said to be inscribed, on a marble pillar and in Chaldaic characters,\n the following inscription, which Ch\u00e6rilus translated into Greek, and reduced to\n metre. And the inscription is as follows\u2014 \n I was the king, and while I lived on earth, \n And saw the bright rays of the genial sun, \n I ate and drank and loved; and knew full well \n \n The time that men do live on earth was brief, \n And liable to many sudden changes, \n Reverses, and calamities. Now others \n Will have th' enjoyment of my luxuries, \n Which I do leave behind me. For these reasons \n I never ceased one single day from pleasure. \n But Clitarchus, in the fourth book of his History of Alexander, says that\n Sardanapalus died of old age after he had lost the sovereignty over the Syrians.\n And Aristobulus says\u2014 \"In Anchiale, which was built by Sardanapalus, did\n Alexander, when he was on his expedition against the Persians, pitch his camp. And\n at no great distance was the monument of Sardanapalus, on which there was a marble\n figure putting together the fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a\n fillip. And there was on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters\u2014\n \n Sardanapalus \n The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes, \n In one day built Anchiale and Tarsus. \n Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth e'en this,\u2014 \n by this meaning the fillip he was giving with his\n fingers. \n ","39":"\n But Sardanapalus was not the only king who was very luxurious, but so was also\n Androcotus the Phrygian. For he also used to wear a robe embroidered with flowers;\n and to adorn himself more superbly than a woman, as Mnaseas relates, in the third\n book of his History of Europe. But Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says\n that Sagaus the king of the Mariandyni used, out of luxury, to eat, till he\n arrived at old age, out of his nurse's mouth, that he might not have the trouble\n of chewing his own food; and that he never put his hand lower than his navel; on\n which account Aristotle, laughing at Xenocrates the Chalcedonian, for a similar\n preposterous piece of laziness, says\u2014 \n His hands are clean, but sure his mind is not. \n And Ctesias relates that Annarus, a lieutenant of the king of Persia, and\n governor of Babylon, wore the entire dress and ornaments of a woman; and though he\n was only a slave of the king, there used to come into the room while he was at\n supper a hundred and fifty women playing the lyre and singing. And they played and\n sang all the time that he was eating. And Phoenix of Colophon, the poet, speaking\n of Ninus, in the first book of his Iambics, says\u2014 \n \n There was a man named Ninus, as I hear, \n King of Assyria, who had a sea \n Of liquid gold, and many other treasures, \n More than the whole sand of the Caspian sea. \n He never saw a star in all his life, \n But sat still always, nor did wish to see one; \n He never, in his place among the Magi, \n Roused the sacred fire, as the law bids, \n Touching the God with consecrated wand; \n He was no orator, no prudent judge, \n He never learn'd to speak, or count a sum, \n But was a wondrous man to eat and drink \n And love, and disregarded all besides: \n And when he died he left this rule to men, \n Where Nineveh and his monument now stands:\u2014 \n \"Behold and hear, whether from wide Assyria \n You come, or else from Media, or if \n You're a Choraxian, or a long-hair'd native \n Of the lake country in Upper India, \n For these my warnings are not vain or false: \n I once was Ninus, a live breathing man, \n Now I am nothing, only dust and clay, \n And all I ate, and all I sang and jested, \n And all I loved. . . . \n But now my enemies have come upon me, \n They have my treasures and my happiness, \n Tearing me as the Bacch\u00e6 tear a kid; \n And I am gone, not taking with me gold, \n Or horses, or a single silver chariot; \n Once I did wear a crown, now I am dust. \n \n \n ","40":"\n But Theopompus, in the fifteenth book of his History of Philip, says that\n Straton the king of Sidon surpassed all men in luxury and devotion to\n pleasure. For as Homer has represented the Ph\u00e6acians as living feasting and\n drinking, and listening to harp-players and rhapsodists, so also did Straton\n pass the whole of his life; and so much the more devoted to pleasure was he\n than they, that the Ph\u00e6acians, as Homer reports, used to hold their banquets in\n the company of their own wives and daughters; but Straton used to prepare his\n entertainments with flute-playing and harp-playing and lyre-playing women. And\n he sent for many courtesans from Peloponnesus, and for many musicians from\n Ionia, and for other girls from every part of Greece; some skilful in singing\n and some in dancing, for exhibitions of skill in which they had contests before\n himself and his friends; and with these women he spent a great deal of his\n time. He then, delighting in such a life as this, and\n being by nature a slave to his passions, was also especially urged on by\n rivalry with Nicocles. For he and Nicocles were always rivalling one another;\n each of them devoted all his attention to living more luxuriously and\n pleasantly than the other. And so they carried their emulation to such a\n height, as we have heard, that when either of them heard from his visitors what\n was the furniture of the other's house, and how great was the expense gone to\n by the other for any sacrifice, he immediately set to work to surpass him in\n such things. And they were anxious to appear to all men prosperous and\n deserving of envy. Not but what neither of them continued prosperous throughout\n the whole of their lives, but were both of them destroyed by violent\n deaths. \n \n And Anaximenes, in his book entitled the Reverses of Kings, giving the same\n account of Straton, says that he was always endeavouring to rival Nicocles, who\n was the king of Salamis in Cyprus, and who was exceedingly devoted to luxury and\n debauchery, and that they both came to a violent end. \n ","41":"\n And in the first book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, Theopompus,\n speaking of Philip, says\u2014 And on the third day he comes to Onocarsis, which\n was a strong place in Thrace, having a large grove kept in beautiful order, and\n full of every resource for living pleasantly, especially during the summer. For\n it was one of the places which had been especially selected by Cotys, who, of\n all the kings that ever lived in Thrace, was the most eager in his pursuit of\n pleasure and luxury. And going round all the country, wherever he saw any place\n shaded with trees and well watered with springs, he made it into a banqueting\n place. And going to them whenever he chose, he used to celebrate sacrifices to\n the Gods, and there he would stay with his lieutenants, being a very happy and\n enviable man, until he took it into his head to blaspheme Minerva, and to treat\n her with contempt. And the historian goes on to say, that Cotys once\n prepared a feast, as if Minerva had married him; and prepared a bedchamber for\n her, and then, in a state of intoxication, he waited for the goddess. And being\n already totally out of his mind, he sent one of his body-guards to see whether the\n goddess had arrived at the bedchamber. And when he came there, and went back and\n reported that there was nobody there, he shot him and killed\n him. And he treated a second in the same way, until a third went, and on his\n return told him that the goddess had been a long time waiting for him. And this\n king, being once jealous of his wife, cut her up with his own hands, beginning at\n her legs. \n ","42":"\n But in the thirteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, speaking of\n Chabrias the Athenian, he says \u2014 But he was unable to live in the city,\n partly on account of his intemperance, and partly because of the extravagant\n habits of his daily life, and partly because of the Athenians. For they are\n always unfavourable to eminent men; on which account their most illustrious\n citizens preferred to live out of the city. For instance, Iphicrates lived in\n Thrace, and Conon in Cyprus, and Timotheus in Lesbos, and Chares at Sigeum, and\n Chabrias himself in Egypt. And about Chares he says, in his forty-fifth\n book\u2014\"But Chares was a slow and stupid man, and one wholly devoted to pleasure.\n And even when he was engaged in his military expeditions, he used to take about\n with him female flute-players, and female harp-players, and a lot of common\n courtesans. And of the money which was contributed for the purposes of the war,\n some he expended on this sort of profligacy, and some he left behind at Athens, to\n be distributed among the orators and those who propose decrees, and on those\n private individuals who had actions depending. And for all this the Athenian\n populace was so far from being indignant, that for this very reason he became more\n popular than any other citizen; and naturally too: for they all lived in this\n manner, that their young men spent all their time among flute-players and\n courtesans; and those who were a little older than they, devoted themselves to\n gambling, and profligacy of that sort; and the whole people spent more money on\n its public banquets and entertainments than on the provision necessary for the\n well-doing of the state. \n But in the work of Theopompus, entitled, Concerning the Money of which the\n Temple at Delphi was pillaged, he says\u2014 Chares the Athenian got\n sixty talents by means of Lysander. And with this money he gave a banquet to\n the Athenians in the market-place, celebrating a triumphal sacrifice in honour\n of their victory gained in the battle which took place\n against the foreign troops of Philip. And these troops were commanded\n by Ad\u00e6us, surnamed the Cock, con- cerning whom Heraclides the comic poet speaks in\n the following manner\u2014 \n But when he caught the dunghill cock of Philip \n Crowing too early in the morn, and straying, \n He killed him; for he had not got his crest on. \n And having killed this one, then Chares gave \n A splendid banquet to the Athenian people; \n So liberal and magnificent was he. \n And Duris gives the same account. \n \n \n ","43":"\n But Idomeneus tells us that the Pisistratid\u00e6 also, Hippias and Hipparchus,\n instituted banquets and entertainments; on which account they had a vast quantity\n of horses and other articles of luxury. And this it was that made their government\n so oppressive. And yet their father, Pisistratus, had been a moderate man in his\n pleasures, so that he never stationed guards in his fortified places, nor in his\n gardens, as Theopompus relates in his twenty-first book, but let any one who chose\n come in and enjoy them, and take whatever he pleased. And Cimon afterwards adopted\n the same conduct, in imitation of Pisistratus. And Theopompus mentions Cimon in\n the tenth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, saying\u2014 Cimon the\n Athenian never placed any one in his fields or gardens to protect the fruit, in\n order that any of the citizens who chose might go in and pick the fruit, and\n take whatever they wanted in those places. And besides this, he opened his\n house to every one, and made a daily practice of providing a plain meal for a\n great number of people; and all the poor Athenians who came that way might\n enter and partake of it. He also paid great attention to all those who from day\n to day came to ask something of him; and they say that he used always to take\n about with him one or two young men bearing bags of money. And he ordered them\n to give money to whoever came to him to ask anything of him. And they say that\n he also often contributed towards the expense of funerals. And this too is a\n thing that he often did; whenever he met any citizen badly clad, he used to\n order one of the young men who were following him to change cloaks with him.\n And so by all these means he acquired a high reputation, and was the fist of\n all the citizens. \n \n \n But Pisistratus was in many respects very oppressive; and some say that that\n statue of Bacchus which there is at Athens was made in his likeness. \n ","44":"\n And Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that Pericles,\n nicknamed the Olympian, after he got rid of his wife out of his house, and devoted\n himself to a life of pleasure, lived with Aspasia, the courtesan from Megara, and\n spent the greater part of his substance on her. And Themistocles, when the\n Athenians were not yet in such a state of intoxication, and had not yet begun to\n use courtesans, openly filled a chariot with prostitutes, and drove early in the\n morning through the Ceramicus when it was full. But Idomeneus has made this\n statement in an ambiguous manner, so as to leave it uncertain whether he means\n that he harnessed the prostitutes in his chariot like horses, or merely that he\n made them mount his four-horsed chariot. And Possis, in the third book of his\n History of the Affairs of Magnesia, says, that Themistocles, having been invested\n with a crowned magistracy in Magnesia, sacrificed to Minerva, and called the\n festival the Panathen\u00e6a. And he sacrificed also to Dionysius Choopotes, and\n celebrated the festival of the Choeis there. But Clearchus, in the first book of\n his treatise on Friendship, says that Themistocles had a triclinium of great\n beauty made for him, and said that he should be quite contented if he could fill\n that with friends. \n ","45":"\n And Cham\u00e6leon of Pontus, in his Essay on Anacreon, having quoted these lines\u2014\n \n And Periphoretus Artemon \n Is loved by golden-hair'd Eurypyle, \n says that Artemo derived this nickname from living luxuriously, and being\n carried about ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ) on a couch. For\n Anacreon says that he had been previously very poor, and then became on a sudden\n very luxurious, in the following verses\u2014 \n Having before a poor berberium cloak, \n And scanty cap, and his poor ears \n With wooden earrings decorated, \n And wearing round his ribs a newly-bought \n Raw ox-hide, fitter for a case \n For an old-fashion'd shield, this wretch \n Artemon, who long has lived \n With bakers' women, and the lowest of the low, \n Now having found a new style of life, \n \n Often thrusts his neck into the yoke, \n Or beneath the spear doth crouch; \n And many a weal he can display, \n Mark'd on his back with well-deserved scourge; \n And well pluck'd as to hair and beard. \n But now he mounts his chariot, he the son \n Of Cyca, and his golden earrings wears; \n And like a woman bears \n An ivory parasol o'er his delicate head. \n \n \n ","46":"\n But Satyrus, speaking of the beautiful Alcibiades, says, \u2014\u201cIt is said that when he\n was in Ionia, he was more luxurious than the Ionians themselves. And when he was\n in Thebes he trained himself, and practised gymnastic exercises, being more of a\n B\u0153otian than the Thebans themselves. And in Thessaly he loved horses and drove\n chariots; being fonder of horses than the Aleuad\u00e6: and at Sparta he practiced\n courage and fortitude, and surpassed the Laced\u00e6monians themselves. And again, in\n Thrace he out-drank even the Thracians themselves. And once wishing to tempt his\n wife, he sent her a thousand Darics in another man's name: and being exceedingly\n beautiful in his person, he cherished his hair the greater part of his life, and\n used to wear an extraordinary kind of shoe, which is called Alcibias from him. And\n whenever he was a choregus, he made a procession clad in a purple robe; and going\n into the theatre he was admired not only by the men, but also by the women: on\n which account Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, who often had seen Alcibiades,\n speaks of him as a powerful and manly man, and impatient of restraint, and\n audacious, and exceedingly beautiful through all his life. \n \n And whenever he went on a journey he used four of the allied cities as his\n maid-servants. For the Ephesians used to put up a Persian tent for him; and the\n Chians used to find him food for his horses; and the people of Cyzicus supplied\n him with victims for his sacrifices and banquet; and the Lesbians gave him\n wine, and everything else which he wanted for his daily food. And when he came\n to Athens from Olympia, he offered up two pictures, the work of Aglaophon: one\n of which represented the priestesses of Olympia and Delphi crowning him; and in\n the other Nemea was sitting, and Alcibiades on her knees, appearing more\n beautiful than any of the women. And even when on military expeditions he\n wished to appear beautiful; accordingly he had a shield \n made of gold and ivory, on which was carved Love brandishing a thunderbolt as\n the ensign. And once having gone to supper at the house of Anytus, by whom he\n was greatly beloved, and who was a rich man, when one of the company who was\n supping there with him was Thrasyllus, (and he was a poor man,) he pledged\n Thrasyllus in half the cups which were set out on the side-board, and then\n ordered the servants to carry them to Thrasyllus's house; and then he very\n civilly wished Anytus good night, and so departed. But Anytus, in a very\n affectionate and liberal spirit, when some one said what an inconsiderate thing\n Alcibiades had done; 'No, by Jove,' said he, ' but what a kind and considerate\n thing; for when he had the power to have taken away everything, he has left me\n half.' \n \n ","47":"\n And Lysias the orator, speaking of his luxury, says\u2014 For Axiochus and\n Alcibiades having sailed to the Hellespont, married at Abydus, both of them\n marrying one wife, Medontias of Abydus, and both cohabited with her. After this\n they had a daughter, and they said that they could not tell whose daughter she\n was; and when she was old enough to be married, they both cohabited with her\n too; and when Alcibiades came to her, he said that she was the daughter of\n Axiochus, and Axiochus in his turn said she was the daughter of\n Alcibiades. And he is ridiculed by Eupolis, after the fashion of the\n comic writers, as being very intemperate with regard to women; for Eupolis says in\n his Flatterers\u2014 \n \n A. Let Alcibiades leave the women's rooms. \n \n B. Why do you jest. . . . . . . . \n Will you not now go home and try your hand \n On your own wife? \n And Pherecrates says\u2014 \n For Alcibiades, who's no man ( \u1f00\u03bd\u1f74\u03c1 ) at\n all, \n Is, as it seems, now every woman's husband ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1 ). \n And when he was at Sparta he seduced Tim\u00e6a, the wife of Agis the king.\n And when some people reproached him for so doing, he said, that he did not\n intrigue with her out of incontinence, but in order that a son of his might be\n king at Sparta; and that the kings might no longer be said to be descended from\n Hercules, but from Alcibiades: and when he was engaged in his military\n expeditions, he used to take about with him Timandra, the mother of Lais the\n Corinthian, and Theodote, who was an Athenian courtesan. \n \n ","48":"\n But after his banishment, having made the Athenians masters of the Hellespont, and\n having taken more than five thousand Peloponnesians prisoners, he sent them to\n Athens; and after this, returning to his country, he crowned the Attic triremes\n with branches, and mitres, and fillets. And fastening to his own vessels a\n quantity of ships which he had taken, with their beaks broken off, to the number\n of two hundred, and conveying also transports full of Laced\u00e6monian and\n Peloponnesian spoils and arms, he sailed into the Pir\u00e6us: and the trireme in which\n he himself was, ran up to the very bars of the Pir\u00e6us with purple sails; and when\n it got inside the harbour, and when the rowers took their oars, Chrysogonus played\n on a flute the trieric air, clad in a Persian robe, and Callippides the tragedian,\n clad in a theatrical dress, gave the word to the rowers. On account of which some\n one said with great wit\u2014 Sparta could never have endured two Lysanders, nor\n Athens two Alcibiadeses. But Alcibiades was imitating the Medism of\n Pausanias, and when he was staying with Pharnabazus, he put on a Persian robe, and\n learnt the Persian language, as Themistocles had done. \n ","49":"\n And Duris says, in the twenty-second book of his History,\u2014 Pausanias, the\n king of Laced\u00e6mon, having laid aside the national cloak of Laced\u00e6mon, adopted\n the Persian dress. And Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, adopted a theatrical\n robe and a golden tragic crown with a clasp. And Alexander, when he became\n master of Asia, also adopted the Persian dress. But Demetrius outdid them all;\n for the very shoes which he wore he had made in a most costly manner; for in\n its form it was a kind of buskin, made of most expensive purple wool; and on\n this the makers wove a great deal of golden embroidery, both before and behind;\n and his cloak was of a brilliant tawny colour; and, in short, a representation\n of the heavens was woven into it, having the stars and twelve signs of the\n Zodiac all wrought in gold; and his head-band was spangled all over with gold,\n binding on a purple broad-brimmed hat in such a manner that the outer fringes\n hung down the back. And when the Demetrian festival was celebrated at Athens,\n Demetrius himself was painted on the proscenium, sitting on the world. \n \n And Nymphis of Heraclea, in the sixth book of his treatise on his Country,\n says\u2014\"Pausanias, who defeated Mardonius at Plat\u00e6a, having transgressed the laws of\n Sparta, and given himself up to pride, when staying near\n Byzantium, dared to put an inscription on the brazen goblet which is there\n consecrated to the gods, whose temple is at the entrance of the strait, (and the\n goblet is in existence to this day,) as if he had dedicated it himself; putting\n this inscription on it, forgetting himself through his luxury and arrogance\u2014\n \n Pausanias, the general of broad Greece, \n Offered this goblet to the royal Neptune, \n A fit memorial of his deathless valour, \n Here in the Euxine sea. He was by birth \n A Spartan, and Cleombrotus's son, \n Sprung from the ancient race of Hercules.\" \n \n \n ","50":"\n \n Pharax the Laced\u00e6monian also indulged himself in luxury, as\n Theopompus tells us in the fourteenth book of his History, and he abandoned\n himself to pleasure in so dissolute and unrestrained a manner, that by reason\n of his intemperance he was much oftener taken for a Sicilian, than for a\n Spartan by reason of his country. And in his fifty-second book he says\n that Archidamus the Laced\u00e6monian, having abandoned his national customs,\n adopted foreign and effeminate habits; so that he could not endure the way of\n life which existed in his own country, but was always, by reason of his\n intemperance, anxious to live in foreign countries. And when the Tarentines\n sent an embassy about an alliance, he was anxious to go out with them as an\n ally; and being there, and having been slain in the wars, he was not thought\n worthy even of a burial, although the Tarentines offered a great deal of money\n to the enemy to be allowed to take up his body. \n \n And Phylarehus, in the tenth book of his Histories, says that Isanthes was the\n king of that tribe of Thracians called Crobyzi, and that he surpassed all the men\n of his time in luxury; and he was a rich man, and very handsome. And the same\n historian tells us, in his twenty-second book, that Ptolemy the Second, king of\n Egypt, the most admirable of all princes, and the most learned and accomplished of\n men, was so beguiled and debased in his mind by his unseasonable luxury, that he\n actually dreamed that he should live for ever, and said that he alone had found\n out how to become immortal. And once, after he had been afflicted by the gout for\n many days, when at last he got a little better, and saw through his window-blinds\n some Egyptians dining by the river side, and eating whatever it might be that they\n had, and lying at random on the sand, O wretched man\n that I am, said he, that I am not one of those men! \n \n ","51":"\n Now Callias and his flatterers we have already sufficiently mentioned. But since\n Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasures, speaks of him, we will return\n to the subject and quote what he says:\u2014\"When first the Persians made an expedition\n against Greece, there was, as they say, an Eretrian of the name of Diomnestus, who\n became master of all the treasures of the general; for he happened to have pitched\n his tent in his field, and to have put his money away in some room of his house.\n But when the Persians were all destroyed, then Diomnestus took the money without\n any one being aware of it; but when the king of Persia sent an army into Eretria\n the second time, ordering his generals utterly to destroy the city, then, as was\n natural, all who were at all well off carried away their treasures. Accordingly\n those of the family of Diomnestus who were left, secretly removed their money to\n Athens, to the house of Hipponicus the son of Callias, who was surnamed Ammon; and\n when all the Eretrians had been driven out of their city by the Persians, this\n family remained still in possession of their wealth, which was great. So\n Hipponicus, who was the son of that man who had originally received the deposit,\n begged the Athenians to grant him a place in the Acropolis, where he might\n construct a room to store up all this money in, saying that it was not safe for\n such vast sums to remain in a private house. And the Athenians did grant him such\n a place; but afterwards, he, being warned against such a step by his friends,\n changed his mind. \n \"Callias, therefore, became the master of all this money, and lived a life of\n pleasure, (for what limit was there to the flatterers who surrounded him, or to\n the troops of companions who were always about him? and what extravagance was\n there which he did not think nothing of?) However, his voluptuous life afterwards\n reduced him so low, that he was compelled to pass the rest of his life with one\n barbarian old woman for a servant, and he was in want of actual daily necessaries,\n and so he died. \n \n But who was it who got rid of the riches of Nicias of Pergasa, or of\n Ischomachus? was it not Autoclees and Epiclees, who preferred living with one\n another, an who considered everything second to pleasure? and after they had\n squandered all this wealth, they drank hemlock\n together, and so perished. \n \n ","52":"\n But, concerning the luxury of Alexander the Great, Ephippus the Olynthian, in his\n treatise on the Deaths of Alexander and Heph\u00e6stion, says that he had in his\n park a golden throne, and couches with silver feet, on which he used to sit and\n transact business with his companions. But Nicobule says, that\n while he was at supper all the morris dancers and athletes studied to\n amuse the king; and at his very last banquet, Alexander, remembering an episode\n in the Andromeda of Euripides, recited it in a declamatory manner, and then\n drank a cup of unmixed wine with great eagerness, and compelled all the rest to\n do so too. And Ephippus tells us that Alexander used to wear\n even the sacred vestments at his entertainments; and sometimes he would wear\n the purple robe, and cloven sandals, and horns of Ammon, as if he had been the\n god; and sometimes he would imitate Diana, whose dress he often wore while\n driving in his chariot; having on also a Persian robe, but displaying above his\n shoulders the bow and javelin of the goddess. Sometimes also he would appear in\n the guise of Mercury; at other times, and indeed almost every day, he would\n wear a purple cloak, and a tunic shot with white, and a cap which had a royal\n diadem attached to it. And when he was in private with his friends he wore the\n sandals of Mercury, and the petasus on his head, and held the caduceus in his\n hand. Often also he wore a lion's skin, and carried a club, like\n Hercules. \n \n What wonder then is it, if in our time the emperor Com- modus, when he drove\n abroad in his chariot, had the club of Hercules lying beside him, with a lion's\n skin spread at his feet, and liked to be called Hercules, when even Alexander, the\n pupil of Aristotle, represented himself as like so many gods, and even like Diana?\n And Alexander used to have the floor sprinkled with exquisite perfumes and with\n fragrant wine; and myrrh was burnt before him, and other kinds of incense; and all\n the bystanders kept silence, or spoke only words of good omen, out of fear. For he\n was a very violent man, with no regard for human life; for he appeared to be a man\n of a melancholic constitution. And on one occasion, at Ecbatana, when he was\n offering a sacrifice to Bacchus, and when everything was prepared in a most lavish\n manner for the banquet, . . . and Satrabates the satrap,\n feasted all the soldiers . . . . . But when a great multitude was collected\n to see the spectacle, says Ephippus, \"there were on a sudden some\n arrogant proclamations published, more insolent even than Persian arrogance was\n wont to dictate. For, as different people were publishing different proclamations,\n and proposing to make Alexander large presents, which they called crowns, one of\n the keepers of his armoury, going beyond all previous flattery, having previously\n arranged the matter with Alexander, ordered the herald to proclaim that Gorgos,\n the keeper of the armoury, presents Alexander, the son of Ammon, with three\n thousand pieces of gold; and will also present him, when he lays siege to Athens,\n with ten thousand complete suits of armour, and with an equal number of catapults\n and all weapons required for the war. \n ","53":"\n And Chares, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander, says\u2014\"When he took\n Darius prisoner, he celebrated a marriage-feast for himself and his companions,\n having had ninety-two bedchambers prepared in the same place. There was a house\n built capable of containing a hundred couches; and in it every couch was adorned\n with wedding paraphernalia to the value of twenty min\u00e6, and was made of silver\n itself; but his own bed had golden feet. And he also invited to the banquet which\n he gave, all his own private friends, and those he arranged opposite to himself\n and the other bridegrooms; and his forces also belonging to the army and navy, and\n all the ambassadors which were present, and all the other strangers who were\n staying at his court. And the apartment was furnished in the most costly and\n magnificent manner, with sumptuous garments and cloths, and beneath them were\n other cloths of purple, and scarlet, and gold. And, for the sake of solidity,\n pillars supported the tent, each twenty cubits long, plated all over with gold and\n silver, and inlaid with precious stones; and all around these were spread costly\n curtains embroidered with figures of animals, and with gold, having gold and\n silver curtain-rods. And the circumference of the court was four stadia. And the\n banquet took place, beginning at the sound of trumpet, at that marriage feast, and\n on other occasions whenever the king offered a solemn sacrifice, so that all the\n army knew it. \n \n And this marriage feast lasted five days. And a great num- ber both of barbarians\n and Greeks brought contributions to it; and also some of the Indian tribes did so.\n And there were present some wonderful conjurors\u2014Scymnus of Tarentum, and\n Philistides of Syracuse, and Heraclitus of Mitylene; after whom also Alexis of\n Tarentum, the rhapsodist, exhibited his skill. There came also harp-players, who\n played without singing,\u2014Cratinus of Methymne, and Aristonymus the Athenian, and\n Athenodorus the Teian. And Heraclitus the Tarentine played on the harp,\n accompanying himself with his voice, and so did Aristocrates the Theban. And of\n fluteplayers accompanied with song, there were present Dionysius of Heraclea, and\n Hyperbolus of Cyzicus. And of other fluteplayers there were the following, who\n first of all played the air called The Pythian, and afterwards played with the\n choruses,\u2014Timotheus, Phrynichus, Caphesias, Diophantus, and also Evius the\n Chalcidian. And from this time forward, those who were formerly called\n Dionysio-colaces, were called\n Alexandro-colaces, on account of the extravagant liberality of their presents,\n with which Alexander was pleased. And there were also tragedians who\n acted,\u2014Thessalus, and Athenodorus, and Aristocritus; and of comic actors there\n were Lycon, and Phormion, and Ariston. There was also Phasimelus the harp-player.\n And the crowns sent by the ambassadors and by other people amounted in value to\n fifteen thousand talents. \n ","54":"\n But Polycletus of Larissa, in the eighth book of his History, says that Alexander\n used to sleep on a golden couch, and that flute-playing men and women followed him\n to the camp, and that he used to drink till daybreak. And Clearchus, in his\n treatise on Lives, speaking of Darius who was dethroned by Alexander, says,\n The king of the Persians offered prizes to those who could invent\n pleasures for him, and by this conduct allowed his whole empire and sovereignty\n to be subverted by pleasures. Nor was he aware that he was defeating himself\n till others had wrested his sceptre from him and had been proclaimed in his\n place. And Phylarchus, in the twenty-third book of his History, and\n Agatharchides of Cnidus, in the tenth book of his History of Asia, say that the\n companions also of Alexander gave way to the most extravagant \n luxury. And one of them was a man named Agnon, who used to wear golden studs in\n his sandals and shoes. And Cleitus, who was surnamed The White, whenever he was\n about to transact business, used to converse with every one who came to him while\n walking about on a purple carpet. And Perdiccas and Craterus, who were fond of\n athletic exercises, had men follow them with hides fastened together so as to\n cover a place an entire stadium in extent; and then they selected a spot within\n the encampment which they had covered with these skins as an awning; and under\n this they practised their gymnastics. \n They were followed also by numerous beasts of burden, which carried sand for the\n use of the pal\u00e6stra. And Leonnatus and Menelaus, who were very fond of hunting,\n had curtains brought after them calculated to enclose a space a hundred stadia in\n circumference, with which they fenced in a large space and then practised hunting\n within it. And as for the golden plane-trees, and the golden vine\u2014having on it\n bunches of grapes made of emeralds and Indian carbuncles, and all sorts of other\n stones of the most costly ad magnificent description, under which the kings of\n Persia used often to sit when transacting business,\u2014the expense of all this, says\n Phylarchus, was far less than the daily sums squandered by Alexander; for he had a\n tent capable of containing a hundred couches, and fifty golden pillars supported\n it. And over it were spread golden canopies wrought with the most superb and\n costly embroidery, to shade all the upper part of it. And first of all, five\n hundred Persian Melophori stood all round the inside of it, clad in robes of\n purple and apple-green; and besides them there were bowmen to the number of a\n thousand, some clad in garments of a fiery red, and others in purple; and many of\n them had blue cloaks. And in front of them stood five hundred Macedonian\n Argyraspides; and in the middle of the tent was placed a golden chair, on which\n Alexander used to sit and transact business, his body-guards standing all around.\n And on the outside, all round the tent, was a troop of elephants regularly\n equipped, and a thousand Macedonians, having Macedonian dresses; and then ten\n thousand Persians: and the number of those who wore purple amounted to five\n hundred, to whom Alexander gave this dress for them to wear. And though he had\n such a numerous retinue of friends and servants, still no one\n dared to approach Alexander of his own accord; so great was his dignity and the\n veneration with which they regarded him. And at that time Alexander wrote letters\n to the cities in Ionia, and to the Chians first of all, to send him a quantity of\n purple; for he wished all his companions to wear purple robes. And when his letter\n was read among the Chians, Theocritus the philosopher being present, said\u2014 \n He fell by purple death and mighty fate. \n \n \n ","55":"\n And Posidonius, in the twenty-eighth book of his History, says that\n Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Grypus, when he was celebrating the\n games at Daphne, gave a magnificent entertainment; at which, first of all, a\n distribution of entire joints took place, and after that another distribution\n of geese, and hares, and antelopes all alive. There were also, says he,\n distributed golden crowns to the feasters, and a great quantity of\n silver plate, and of servants, and horses, and camels. And every one was\n expected to mount a camel, and drink; and after that he was presented with the\n camel, and with all that was on the camel, and the boy who stood by it. \n And in his fourteenth book, speaking of his namesake Antiochus, who made war upon\n Arsaces, and invaded Media, he says that \"he made a feast for a great multitude\n every day; at which, besides the things which were consumed, and the heaps of\n fragments which were left, every one of the guests carried away with him entire\n joints of beasts, and birds, and fishes which had never been carved, all ready\n dressed, in sufficient quantities to fill a waggon. And after this they were\n presented with a quantity of sweetmeats, and chaplets, and crowns of myrrh and\n frankincense, with turbans as long as a man, made of strips of gold brocade. \n ","56":"\n But Clytus, the pupil of Aristotle, in his History of Miletus, says that\n Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, collected everything that was worth\n speaking of everywhere to gratify his luxury, having assembled dogs from\n Epirus, and goats from Scyros, and sheep from Miletus, and swine from\n Sicily. \n And Alexis, in the third book of his Samian Annals, says that\n Samos was adorned by Polycrates with the productions of many other\n cities; as he imported Molossian and Laced\u00e6monian dogs, and goats from Scyros\n and Naxos, and sheep from Miletus and Attica. He also, says he,\n sent for artists, promising them enormous wages. But before he became\n tyrant, having prepared a number of costly couches and goblets, he allowed any\n one the use of them who was prepping any marriage-feast or extraordinary\n entertainment. And after hearing all these particulars we may well\n admire the tyrant, because it was nowhere written that he had sent for any women\n or boys from any other countries, although he was of a very amorous constitution,\n and was a rival in love of Anacreon the poet; and once, in a fit of jealousy, he\n cut off all the hair of the object of his passion. And Polycrates was the first\n man who called the ships which he had built Samians, in honour of his country. \n But Clearchus says that Polycrates, the tyrant of the effeminate Samos, was\n ruined by the intemperance of his life, imitating the effeminate practices of\n the Lydians; on which account, in opposition to the place in Sardis called the\n beautiful Ancon, he prepared a place in the chief city of the Samians, called\n Laura; he made those famous, Samian flowers in opposition to the Lydian. And\n the Samian Laura was a narrow street in the city, full of common women, and of\n all kinds of food calculated to gratify intemperance and to promote enjoyment,\n with which he actually filled Greece. But the flowers of the Samians are the\n preeminent beauty of the men and women, and indeed of the whole city, at its\n festivals and banquets. And these are the words of Clearchus. And I\n myself am acquainted with a narrow street in my native city of Alexandria, which\n to this very day is called the Happy Street, in which every apparatus of luxury\n used to be sold. \n ","57":"\n But Aristotle, in his treatise on Admirable and Wonderful Things, says that\n Alcisthenes of Sybaris, out of luxury, had a garment prepared for him of\n such excessive expensive-ness that he exhibited it at Lacinium, at the festival\n of Juno, at which all the Italians assemble, and that of all the things which\n were exhibited that was the most admired. And he says that\n Dionysius the elder afterwards became master of it,\n and sold it to the Carthaginians for a hundred and twenty talents. \n Polemo also speaks of it in his book entitled, A Treatise concerning the Sacred\n Garments at Carthage. But concerning Smindyrides of Sybaris, and his luxury,\n Herodotus has told us, in his sixth book, saying that he sailed from Sybaris to\n court Agariste, the daughter of Clisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon.\n And, says he, there came from Italy Smindyrides, the son\n of Hippocrates, a citizen of Sybaris; who carried his luxury to the greatest\n height that ever was heard of among men. At all events he was attended by a\n thousand cooks and bird-catchers. Tim\u00e6us also mentions him in his\n seventh book. But of the luxury of Dionysius the younger, who was also tyrant of\n Sicily, an account is given by Satyrus the Peripatetic, in his Lives. For he says\n that he used to fill rooms holding thirty couches with feasters. And Clearchus, in\n the fourth book of his Lives, writes as follows:\u2014 But Dionysius, the son of\n Dionysius, the cruel oppressor of all Sicily, when he came to the city of the\n Locrians, which was his metropolis, (for Doris his mother was a Locrian woman\n by birth,) having strewed the floor of the largest house in the city with wild\n thyme and roses, sent for all the maidens of the Locrians in turn; and then\n rolled about naked, with them naked also, on this layer of flowers, omitting no\n circumstance of infamy. And so, not long afterwards, they who had been insulted\n in this manner having got his wife and children into their power, prostituted\n them in the public roads with great insult, sparing them no kind of\n degradation. And when they had wreaked their vengeance upon them, they thrust\n needles under the nails of their fingers, and put them to death with torture.\n And when they were dead, they pounded their bones in mortars, and having cut up\n and distributed the rest of their flesh, they imprecated curses on all who did\n not eat of it; and in accordance with this unholy imprecation, they put their\n flesh into the mills with the flour, that it might be eaten by all those who\n made bread. And all the other parts they sunk in the sea. But Dionysius\n himself, at last going about as a begging priest of Cybele, and beating the\n drum, ended his life very miserably. We, therefore, ought to guard against what\n is called luxury, which is the ruin of a man's life; and we ought to think\n insolence the destruction of everything. \n \n \n ","58":"\n But Diodorus Siculus, in his books On the Library, says that the citizens\n of Agrigentum prepared for Gelon a very costly swimming-bath, being seven\n stadia in circumference and twenty cubits deep; and water was\n introduced into it from the rivers and fountains, and it serve for a great pond to\n breed fish in, and supplied great quantities of fish for the luxury and enjoyment\n of Gelon. A great number of swans also,\" as he relates, flew into it; so\n that it was a very beautiful sight. But afterwards the lake was destroyed by\n becoming filled with mud. And Duris, in the tenth book of his History\n of Agathocles, says that near the city of Hip- ponium a grove is shown of\n extraordinary beauty, excellently well watered; in which there is also a place\n called the Horn of Amalthea; and that this grove was made by Gelon. But Silenus of\n Calatia, in the third book of his History of Sicily, says that near Syracuse there\n is a garden laid out in a most expensive manner, which is called Mythus, in which\n Hiero the king used to transact his business. And the whole country about\n Panormus, in\n Sicily, is called The Garden, because it is full of highly-cultivated trees, as\n Callias tells us in the eighth book of his History of Agathocles. \n And Posidonius, in the eighth book of his History, speaking of Damophilus the\n Sicilian, by whose means it was that the Servile war was stirred up, and saying\n that he was a slave to his luxury, writes as follows:\u2014\"He therefore was a slave to\n luxury and debauchery. And he used to drive through the country on a four-wheeled\n chariot, taking with him horses, and servants of great personal beauty, and a\n disorderly crowd of flatterers and military boys running around his chariot. And\n ultimately he, with his whole family, perished in a disgraceful manner, being\n treated with the most extreme violence and insult by his own slaves. \n ","59":"\n And Demetrius Phalereus, as Duris says in the sixteenth volume of his Histories,\n being possessed of a revenue of twelve hundred talents a-year, and spending a\n small portion of it on his soldiers, and on the necessary expenses of the state,\n squandered all the rest of it on gratifying his innate love of debauchery, having\n splendid banquets eve y day, and a great number of guests to feast with him. And\n in the prodigality of his expense in his entertainments he outdid even the Macedonians, and, at the same time, in the elegance of\n them, he surpassed the Cyprians and Ph\u0153nicians. And perfumes were sprinkled over\n the ground, and many of the floors in the men's apartments were inlaid with\n flowers, and were exquisitely wrought in other ways by the artists. There were\n also secret meetings with women, and other scenes more shameful still. And\n Demetrius, who gave laws to others, and who regulated the lives of others,\n exhibited in his own life an utter contempt of all law. He also paid great\n attention to his personal appearance, and dyed the hair of his head with a yellow\n colour, and anointed his face with rouge, and smeared himself over with other\n unguents also; for he was anxious to appear agreeable and beautiful in the eyes of\n all whom he met. \n And in the procession of the Dionysia, which he celebrated when he was archon at\n Athens, a chorus sang an ode of Siromen the Solensian, addressed to him, in which\n he was called, Like the Sun:\u2014 \n And above all the noble prince \n Demetrius, like the sun in face, \n Honours you, Bacchus, with a holy worship. \n And Carystius of Pergamus, in the third book of his Commentaries,\n says\u2014 Demetrius Phalereus, when his brother Himer\u00e6us was put to death by\n Antipater, was himself staying with Nicanor; and he was accused of having\n sacrificed the Epiphaneia in honour of his brother. And after he became a\n friend of Cassander, he was very powerful. And at first his dinner consisted of\n a kind of pickle, containing olives from all countries, and cheese from the\n islands; but when he became rich, he bought Moschion, the most skilful of all\n the cooks and confectioners of that age. And he had such vast quantities of\n food prepared for him every day, that, as he gave Moschion what was left each\n day, he (Moschion) in two years purchased three detached houses in the city;\n and insulted free-born boys, and some of the wives of the most eminent of the\n citizens: and all the boys envied Theognis, with whom he was in love. And so\n important an honour was it considered to be allowed to come near Demetrius,\n that, as he one day had walked about after dinner near the Tripods, on all the\n following days all the most beautiful boys came together to that place, in the\n hopes of being seen by him. \n \n \n ","60":"\n And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the tenth book of his History, and again in the\n twentieth book, says that Lucullus, when he came to Rome and celebrated his\n triumph, and gave an account of the war against Mithridates, ran into the most\n unbounded extravagance, after having previously been very moderate; and was\n altogether the first guide to luxury, and the first example of it, among the\n Romans, having become master of the riches of two kings, Mithridates and Tigranes.\n And Sittius, also, was a man very notorious among the Romans for his luxury and\n effeminacy, as Rutilitius tells us; for as to Apicius, we have already spoken of\n him. And almost all historians relate that Pausanias and Lysander were very\n notorious for their luxury; on which account Agis said of Lysander, that Sparta\n had produced him as a second Pausanias. But Theopompus, in the tenth book of his\n History of the Affairs of Greece, gives exactly the contrary account of Lysander,\n saying that he was a most laborious man, able to earn the goodwill of both\n private individuals and monarchs, being very moderate and temperate, and\n superior to all the allurements of pleasure; and accordingly, when he had\n become master of almost the whole of Greece, it will be found that he never in\n any city indulged in amatory excesses, or in unreasonable drinking parties and\n revels. \n \n ","61":"\n But luxury and extravagance were so very much prac- tised among the ancients, that\n even Parrhasius the painter always wore a purple robe, and a golden crown on his\n head, as Clearchus relates, in his Lives: for he, being most immoderately\n luxurious, and also to a degree beyond what was becoming to a painter, laid claim,\n in words, to great virtue, and inscribed upon the works which were done by him\u2014\n \n Parrhasius, a most luxurious man, \n And yet a follower of purest virtue, \n Painted this work. \n But some one else, being indignant at this inscription, wrote by the side\n of it, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (worthy of a stick).\n Parrhasius also put the following inscription on many of his works:\u2014 \n Parrhasius, a most luxurious man, \n And yet a follower of purest virtue, \n Painted this work: a worthy citizen \n Of noble Ephesus. His father's name \n Evenor was, and he, his lawful son, \n Was the first artist in the whole of Greece. \n \n He also boasted, in a way which no one could be indignant at,\n in the following lines:\u2014 \n This will I say, though strange it may appear, \n That clear plain limits of this noble art \n Have been discovered by my hand, and proved. \n And now the boundary which none can pass \n Is well defined, though nought that men can do \n Will ever wholly escape blame or envy. \n And once, at Samos, when he was contending with a very inferior painter\n in a picture of Ajax, and was defeated, when his friends were sympathising with\n him and expressing their indignation, he said that he himself cared very little\n about it, but that he was sorry for Ajax, who was thus defeated a second time. And\n so great was his luxury, that he wore a purple robe, and a white turban on his\n head; and used to lean on a stick, ornamented all round with golden fretted work:\n and he used even to fasten the strings of his sandals with golden clasps. However,\n as regarded his art, he was not churlish or ill-tempered, but affable and\n good-humoured; so that he sang all the time that he was painting, as Theophrastus\n relates, in his treatise on Happiness. \n But once he spoke in a marvellous strain, more like a quack, when he said, when he\n was painting the Hercules at Lindus, that the god had appeared to him in a dream,\n in that form and dress which was the best adapted for painting; on which account\n he inscribed on the picture\u2014 \n Here you may see the god as oft he stood \n Before Parrhasius in his sleep by night. \n \n \n ","62":"\n We find also whole schools of philosophers which have openly professed to have\n made choice of pleasure. And there is the school called the Cyrenaic, which\n derives its origin from Aristippus the pupil of Socrates: and he devoted himself\n to pleasure in such a way, that he said that it was the main end of life; and that\n happiness was founded on it, and that happiness was at best but short-lived. And\n he, like the most debauched of men, thought that he had nothing to do either with\n the recollection of past enjoyments, or with the hope of future ones; but he\n judged of all good by the present alone, and thought that having enjoyed, and\n being about to enjoy, did not at all concern him; since the one case had no longer\n any existence, and the other did not yet exist and was necessarily uncertain:\n acting in this respect like thoroughly dissolute men, who are\n content with being prosperous at the present moment. And his life was quite\n consistent with his theory; for he spent the whole of it in all kinds of luxury\n and extravagance, both in perfumes, and dress, and women. Accordingly, he openly\n kept Lais as his mistress; and he delighted in all the extravagance of Dionysius,\n although he was often treated insultingly by him. \n Accordingly, Hegesander says that once, when he was assigned a very mean place at\n a banquet by Dionysius, he endured it patiently; and when Dionysius asked him what\n he thought of his present place, in comparison of his yesterday's seat, he said,\n That the one was much the same as the other; for that one, says\n he, is a mean seat to-day, because it is deprived of me; but it was\n yesterday the most respectable seat in the room, owing to me: and this one\n to-day has become respectable, because of my presence in it; but yesterday it\n was an inglorious seat, as I was not present in it. And in another\n place Hegesander says\u2014 Aristippus, being ducked with water by Dionysius's\n servants, and being ridiculed by Antiphon for bearing it patiently, said, 'But\n suppose I had been out fishing, and got wet, was I to have left my employment,\n and come away? ' And Aristippus sojourned a considerable time in\n Aegina, indulging in every kind of luxury; on which account Xenophon says in his\n Memorabilia, that Socrates often reproved him, and invented the apologue of Virtue\n and Pleasure to apply it to him. And Aristippus said, respecting Lais, I\n have her, and I am not possessed by her. And when he was at the court\n of Diony- sius, he once had a quarrel with some people about a choice of three\n women. And he used to wash with perfumes, and to say that\u2014 \n E'en in the midst of Bacchanalian revels \n A modest woman will not be corrupted. \n And Alexis, turning him into ridicule in his Galatea, represents one of\n the slaves as speaking in the following banner of one of his disciples:\u2014 \n For this my master once did turn his thoughts \n To study, when he was a stripling young, \n And set his mind to learn philosophy. \n And then a Cyrenean, as he calls himself, \n Named Aristippus, an ingenious sophist, \n And far the first of all the men of his time, \n \n But also far the most intemperate, \n Was in the city. Him my master sought, \n Giving a talent to become his pupil: \n He did not learn, indeed, much skill or wisdom, \n But got instead a sad complaint on his chest. \n And Antiphanes, in his Ant\u00e6us, speaking of the luxurious habits of the\n philosophers, says\u2014 \n My friend, now do you know who this old man \n Is called By his look he seems to be a Greek. \n His cloak is white, his tunic fawn-colour'd, \n His hat is soft, his stick of moderate size, \n His table scanty. Why need I say more, \n I seem to see the genuine Academy. \n \n \n ","63":"\n And Aristoxenus the musician, in his Life of Archytas, represents ambassadors as\n having been sent by Dionysius the younger to the city of the Tarentines, among\n whom was Polyarchus, who was surnamed the Luxurious, a man wholly devoted to\n sensual pleasures, not only in deed, but in word and profession also. And he was a\n friend of Archytas, and not wholly unversed in philosophy; and so he used to come\n with him into the sacred precincts, and to walk with him and with his friends,\n listening to his lectures and arguments: and once, when there was a long dispute\n and discussion about the passions, and altogether about sensual pleasures,\n Polyarchus said\u2014 I, indeed, my friends, have often considered the matter,\n and it has seemed to me that this system of the virtues is altogether a long\n way removed from nature; for nature, when it utters its own voice, orders one\n to follow pleasure, and says that this is the conduct of a wise man: but that\n to oppose it, and to bring one's appetites into a state of slavery, is neither\n the part of a wise man, nor of a fortunate man, nor indeed of one who has any\n accurate understanding of what the constitution of human nature really is. And\n it is a strong proof of this, that all men, when they have acquired any power\n worth speaking of, betake themselves to sensual pleasures, and think the power\n of indulging them the principal advantage to be gained from the possession of\n power, and everything else, so to say, as unimportant and superfluous. And we\n may adduce the example of the Persian king at present, and every other tyrant\n possessed of any power worth speaking of,\u2014and in former times, the sovereigns\n of the Lydians and of the Medes,\u2014and even in earlier times still, the tyrants\n of the Syrians behaved in the same manner; for all these\n men left no kind of pleasure unexplored: and it is even said that rewards were\n offered by the Persians to any one who was able to invent a new pleasure. And\n it was a very wise offer to make; for the nature of man is soon satiated with\n long-continued pleasures, even if they be of very exquisite nature. So that,\n since novelty has a very great effect in making a pleasure appear greater, we\n must not despise it, but rather pay great attention to it. And on this account\n it is that many different kinds of dishes have been invented, and many sorts of\n sweetmeats; and many discoveries have been made in the articles of incenses and\n perfumes, and clothes, and beds, and, above all, of cups and other articles of\n furniture. For all these things contribute some amount of pleasure, when the\n material which is admired by human nature is properly employed: and this\n appears to be the case with gold and silver, and with most things which are\n pleasing to the eye and also rare, and with all things which are elaborated to\n a high degree of perfection by manual arts and skill. \n \n ","64":"\n And having discussed after this all the attendance with which the king of the\n Persians is surrounded, and what a number of servants he has, and what their\n different offices are, and also about his amorous indulgences, and also about the\n sweet perfume of his skin, and his personal beauty, and the way in which he lives\n among his friends, and the pleasing sights or sounds which are sought out to\n gratify him, he said that he considered the king of Persia the happiest of\n all men now alive. For there are pleasures prepared for him which are both most\n numerous and most perfect in their kind. And next to him, said he,\n any one may fairly rank our sovereign, though he falls far short of the\n king of Persia. For this latter has all Asia to supply him with luxury, but the\n store which supplies Dionysius will seem very contemptible if compared with\n his. That, then, such a life as h s is worth struggling for, is plain from what\n has happened. For the Medes, after encountering the greatest dangers, derived\n the Syrians of the supremacy, for no other object except to possess themselves\n of the unrestrained licence of the Syria ns. And the Persians overthrew the\n Medes for the same reason, namely, in order to have an unrestrained enjoyment\n of sensual pleasures. And the lawgivers who wish the whole race of men to be on\n an equality, and that no citizens shall indulge in \n superfluous luxury, have made some species of virtue hold its head up. And they\n have written laws about contracts and other matters of the same kind, and\n whatever appeared to be necessary for political communion, and also with\n respect to dress, and to all the other circumstances of life, that they should\n be similar among all the citizens. And so, as all the lawgivers made war upon\n every kind of covetousness, then first the praises of justice began to be more\n thought of: and one of the poets spoke of\u2014 \n The golden face of justice; \n and in another passage some one speaks of\u2014 \n The golden eye of justice. \n And the very name of justice came to be accounted divine, so that in\n some countries there were altars erected and sacrifices instituted to Justice.\n And next to this they inculcated a respect for modesty and temperance, and\n called an excess in enjoyment covetousness; so that a man who obeyed the laws\n and was influenced by the common conversation of men in general, was\n necessarily moderate with respect to sensual pleasures. \n \n ","65":"\n And Duris says, in the twenty-third volume of his History, that in ancient times\n the nobles had a positive fondness for getting drunk. On which account Homer\n represents Achilles as reproaching Agamemnon, and saying\u2014 \n \n \n O thou whose senses are all dimm'd with wine, \n \n Iliad, i. 225. \n \n Thou dog in forehead. \n And when he is describing the death of the king, he makes Agamemnon say\u2014\n \n \n \n E'en in my mirth, and at the friendly feast, \n O'er the full bowl the traitor stabb'd his guest; \n \n Odyss. ii. 418. \n \n pointing out that his death was partly caused by his fondness for\n drunkenness. \n Speusippus also, the relation of Plato, and his successor in his school, was a man\n very fond of pleasure. At all events Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, in his\n letter to him blaming him for his fondness for pleasure, reproaches him also for\n his covetousness, and for his love of Lasthenea the Arcadian, who had been a pupil\n of Plato. \n ","66":"\n But not only did Aristippus and his followers embrace that\n pleasure which consists in motion, but also Epicurus and his followers did the\n same. And not to say anything of those sudden motions, and irritations, and\n titillations, ad also those prickings and stimuli which Epicurus often brigs\n forward, I will merely cite what he has said in his treatise on the End For he\n says\u2014 For I am not able to perceive any good, if I take away all the\n pleasures which arise from flavours, and if I leave out of the question all the\n pleasures arising from amorous indulgences, and all those which are caused by\n hearing sweet sounds, and all those motions which are excited by figures which\n are pleasant to the sight. And Metrodorus in his Epistles\n says\u2014 My good natural philosopher Timocrates, reason which proceeds\n according to nature devotes its whole attention to the stomach. And\n Epicurus says\u2014 The origin and root of all good is the pleasure of the\n stomach; and all excessive efforts of wisdom have reference to the\n stomach. And again, in his treatise concerning the End, he says\u2014\n You ought therefore to respect honour and the virtues, and all things of\n that sort, if they produce pleasure; but if they do not, then we may as well\n have nothing to do with them: evidently in these words making virtue\n subordinate to pleasure, and performing as it were the part of a handmaid to it.\n And in another place he says\u2014 I spit upon honour, and those who worship it\n in a foolish manner, when it produces no pleasure. \n \n ","67":"\n Well then did the Romans, who are in every respect the most admirable of men,\n banish Alcius and Philiscus the Epicureans out of their city, when Lucius\n Postumius was consul, on account of the pleasures which they sought to introduce\n into the city. And in the same manner the Messenians by a public decree banished\n the Epicureans. But Antiochus the king banished all the philosophers out of his\n kingdom, writing thus\u2014\"King Antiochus to Phanias: We have written to you before,\n that no philosopher is to remain in the city, nor in the country. But we hear tat\n there is no small number of them, and that they do great injury to the young men,\n because you have done none of the things about which we wrote to you. As soon,\n therefore, as you receive this letter, order a proclamation to be made, that all\n the philosophers do at once depart from those place, and that as many young men as\n are detected in going to them, shall be fastened to a pillar\n and flogged, and their fathers shall be held in great blame. And let not this\n order be transgressed. \n But before Epicurus, Sophocles the poet was a great instigator to pleasure,\n speaking as follows in his Antigone \u2014 \n For when men utterly forsake all pleasure, \n I reckon such a man no longer living, \n But look upon him as a breathing corpse. \n He may have, if you like, great wealth at home, \n And go in monarch's guise; but if his wealth \n And power bring no pleasure to his mind, \n I would not for a moment deem it all \n Worthy a moment's thought compared with pleasure. \n \n \n ","68":"\n \n And Lycon the Peripatetic, as Antigonus the Carystian says, \"when\n as a young man he had come to Athens for the sake of his education, was most\n accurately informed about everything relating to banquets and drinking parties,\n and as to how much pay every courtesan required. But afterwards having become the\n chief man of the Peripatetic school, he used to entertain his friends at banquets\n with excessive arrogance and extravagance. For, besides the music which was\n provided at his entertainments, and the silver plate and coverlets which were\n exhibited, all the rest of the preparation and the superb character of the dishes\n was such, and the multitude of tables and cooks was so great, that many people\n were actually alarmed, and, though they wished to be admitted into his school,\n shrunk back, fearing to enter, as into a badly governed state, which was always\n burdening its citizens with liturgies and other expensive offices. \n For men were compelled to undertake the regular office of chief of the Peripatetic\n school. And the duties of this office were, to superintend all the novices for\n thirty days, and see that they conducted themselves with regularity. And then, on\n the last day of the month, having received nine obols from each of the novices, he\n received at supper not only all those who contributed their share, but all those\n also whom Lycon might chance to invite, and also all those of the elders who were\n diligent in attending the school; so that the money which was collected was not\n sufficient even for providing sufficient unguents and garlands. He also was bound\n to perform the sacrifices, and to become an overseer of the Muses. All which duties appeared to have but little connexion with reason or\n with philosophy, but to be more akin to luxury and parade. For if any people were\n admitted who were not able to spend money on these objects, they, setting out with\n a very scanty and ordinary choregia . . . . and the money was very much out of\n proportion . . . . . For Plato and Speusippus had not established these\n entertainments, in order that people might dwell upon the pleasures of the table\n from day-break, or for the sake of getting drunk; but in order that men might\n appear to honour the Deity, and to associate with one another in a natural manner;\n and chiefly with a view to natural relaxation and conversation; all which things\n afterwards became in their eyes second to the softness of their garments, and to\n their indulgence in their before-mentioned extravagance. Nor do I except the rest.\n For Lycon, to gratify his luxurious and insolent disposition, had a room large\n enough to hold twenty couches, in the most frequented part of the city, in Conon's\n house, which was well adapted for him to give parties in. And Lycon was a skilful\n and clever player at ball.\" \n ","69":"\n And of Anaxarchus, Clearchus the Solensian writes, in the fifth book of his Lives,\n in the following manner\u2014 Anaxarchus, who was one of those who called\n themselves Eud\u00e6monici, after he had become a rich man through the folly of\n those men who supplied him with means out of their abundance, used to have a\n naked full-grown damsel for his cup-bearer, who was superior in beauty to all\n her fellows; she, if one is to look at the real truth, thus exposing the\n intemperance of all those who employed her. And his baker used to knead the\n dough wearing gloves on his hands, and a cover on his mouth, to prevent any\n perspiration running off his hands, and also to prevent him from breathing on\n his cakes while he was kneading them. So that a man might fairly quote\n to this wise philosopher the verses of Anaxilas the lyric poet\u2014 \n And anointing one's skin with a gold-colour'd ointment, \n And wearing long cloaks reaching down to the ground, \n And the thinnest of slippers, and eating rich truffle \n And the richest of cheese, and the newest of eggs; \n And all sorts of shell-fish, and drinking strong wine \n From the island of Chios, and having, besides, \n A lot of Ephesian beautiful letters, \n In carefully-sewn leather bags. \n \n \n \n ","70":"\n But how far superior to these men is Gorgias the Leontine; of whom the same\n Clearchus says, in the eighth book of his Lives, that because of the temperance of\n his life he lived nearly eighty years in the full possession of all his intellect\n and faculties. And when some one asked him what his system had been which had\n caused him to live with such comfort, and to retain such full possession of his\n senses, he said, I have never done anything merely for the sake of\n pleasure. But Demetrius of Byzantium, in the fourth book of his\n treatise on Poems, says\u2014 Gorgias the Leontine, being once asked by some one\n what was the cause of his living more than a hundred years, said that it was\n because he had never done anything to please any one else except\n himself. And Ochus, after he had had a long enjoyment of kingly power,\n and of all the other things which make life pleasant, being asked towards the\n close of his life by his eldest son, by what course of conduct he had preserved\n the kingly power for so many years, that he also might imitate it; replied,\n By behaving justly towards all men and all gods. And Carystius\n of Pergamus, in his Historical Commentaries, says\u2014 Cephisodorus the Theban\n relates that Polydorus the physician of Teos used to live with Antipater; and\n that the king had a common kind of coarse carpet worked in rings like a\n counterpane, on which he used to recline; and brazen bowls and only a small\n number of cups; for that he was a man fond of plain living and averse to\n luxury. \n \n ","71":"\n But the story which we have of Tithonus represents him as a person sleeping from\n daybreak to sunset, so that his appetites scarcely awakened him by evening. On\n which account he was said to sleep with Aurora, because he was so wholly enslaved\n by his appetites. And as he was at a later period of life prevented from indulging\n them by old age, and being wholly dependent on them. . . . And Melanthius,\n stretching out his neck, was choked by his enjoyments, being a greater glutton\n than the Melanthius of Ulysses. And many other men have destroyed their bodily\n strength entirely by their unreasonable indulgence; and some have become\n inordinately fat; and others have become stupid and insensible by reason of their\n inordinate luxury. Accordingly, Nymphis of Heraclea, in the second book of his\n History of Heraclea, says \u2014 Dionysius the son of Clearchus, who was the\n first tyrant of Heraclea, and who was himself afterwards\n tyrant of his country, grew enormously fat without perceiving it, owing to his\n luxury and to his daily gluttony; so the on account of his obesity he was\n constantly oppressed by difficulty of breathing and a feeling of suffocation.\n On which account his physicians ordered thin needles of an exceedingly great\n length to be made, to be run into his sides an chest whenever he fell into a\n deeper sleep than usual. And up to a certain point his flesh was so callous by\n reason of the fat, that it never felt the needles; but if ever they touched a\n part that was not so overloaded, then he felt them, and was awakened by them.\n And he used to give answers to people who came to him, holding a chest in front\n of his body so as to conceal all the rest of his person, and leave only his\n face visible; and in this condition he conversed with these who came to\n him. And Menander also, who was a person as little given to\n evil-speaking as possible, mentions him in his Fishermen, introducing some exiles\n from Heraclea as saying\u2014 \n For a fat pig was lying on his face; \n and in another place he says\u2014 \n He gave himself to luxury so wholly, \n That he could not last long to practise it; \n and again he says\u2014 \n Forming desires for myself, this death \n Does seem the only happy one,\u2014to grow \n Fat in my heart and stomach, and so lie \n Flat on my back, and never say a word, \n Drawing my breath high up, eating my fill, \n And saying, Here I waste away with pleasure. \n \n And he died when he was fifty-five years of age, of which he had been\n tyrant thirty-three,\u2014being superior to all the tyrants who had preceded him in\n gentleness and humanity. \n ","72":"\n And Ptolemy the Seventh, king of Egypt was a man of this sort, the same who caused\n himself to be styled Euergetes, but who was called Cacergetes by the\n Alexandrians, Accordingly, Posidonius the Stoic, who went with Scipio Africanus\n when he was sent to Alexandria, and w o there saw this Ptolemy, writes thus, in\n the seventh book of his History, \u2014But owing to his luxury his whole body was eaten\n up with fat, and with the greatness of his belly, which was so large that no one\n could put his arms all round it; and he wore over it a tunic\n which reached down to his feet, having sleeves which reached to his wrists, and he\n never by any chance walked out except on this occasion of Scipio's visit.\" And\n that this king was not averse to luxury, he tells us when he speaks of himself,\n relating, in the eighth book of his Commentaries, how he was priest of Apollo at\n Cyrene, and how he gave a banquet to those who had been priests before him;\n writing thus:\u2014 The Artemitia is the great festival of Cyrene, on which\n occasion the priest of Apollo (and that office is one which lasts a year) gives\n a banquet to all those who have been his predecessors in the office; and he\n sets before each of them a separate dish. And this dish is an earthenware\n vessel, holding about twenty artab\u00e6, in which there are many kinds of game\n elaborately dressed, and many kinds of bread, and of tame birds, and of\n sea-fish, and also many species of foreign preserved meats and pickled-fish.\n And very often some people also furnish them with a handsome youth as an\n attendant. But we ourselves omitted all this, and instead we furnished them\n with cups of solid silver, each being of as much value as all the things which\n we have just enumerated put together; and also we presented each man with a\n horse properly harnessed, and a groom, and gilt trappings; and we invited each\n man to mount his horse and ride him home. \n \n His son Alexander also became exceedingly fat, the one, I mean, who put his mother\n to death who had been his partner in the kingdom. Accordingly Posidonius, in the\n forty-seventh book of his History, mentions him in the following terms:\u2014 But\n the king of Egypt being detested by the multitude, but flattered by the people\n whom he had about him, and living in great luxury, was not able even to walk,\n unless he went leaning on two friends; but for all that he would, at his\n banquets, leap off from a high couch, and dance barefoot with more vigour than\n even those who made dancing their profession. \n \n ","73":"\n And Agatharchides, in the sixteenth book of his History of Europe, says that\n Magas, who was king of Cyrene for fifty years, and who never had any wars, but\n spent all his time in luxury, became, towards the end of his life, so im- mensely bulky and burdensome to himself, that he was at last\n actually choked by his fat, from the inactivity of his body, and the enormous\n quantity of food which he consumed. But among the Laced\u00e6monians, the same man\n relates, in his twenty-seventh book, that it is thought a proof of no ordinary\n infamy if any one is of an unmanly appearance, or if any one appears at all\n inclined to have a large belly; as the young men are exhibited naked before the\n ephori every ten days. And the ephori used every day to take notice both of the\n clothes and bedding of the young men; and very properly. For the cooks at\n Laced\u00e6mon were employed solely on dressing meat plainly, and on nothing else. And\n in his twenty-seventh book, Agatharchides says that the Laced\u00e6monians brought\n Nauclides, the son of Polybiades, who was enormously fat in his body, and who had\n become of a vast size through luxury, into the middle of the assembly; and then,\n after Lysander had publicly reproached him as an effeminate voluptuary, they\n nearly banished him from the city, and threatened him that they would certainly do\n so if he did not reform his life; on which occasion Lysander said that Agesilaus\n also, when he was in the country near the Hellespont, making war against the\n barbarians, seeing the Asiatics very expensively clothed, but utterly useless in\n their bodies, ordered all who were taken prisoners, to be stripped naked and sold\n by the auctioneer; and after that he ordered their clothes to be sold without\n them; in order that the allies, knowing that they had to fight for a great prize,\n and against very contemptible men, might advance with greater spirit against their\n enemies. And Python the orator, of Byzantium, as Leon, his fellow-citizen,\n relates, was enormously fat; and once, when the Byzantians were divided against\n one another in seditious quarrels, he, exhorting his fellow-citizens to unanimity,\n said\u2014 You see, my friends, what a size my body is; but I have a wife who\n is much fatter than I am; now, when we are both agreed, one small bed is large\n enough for both of us; but when we quarrel, the whole house is not big enough\n for us. \n \n ","74":"\n How much better, then, is it, my good friend Timocrates, to be poor and thinner\n than even those men whom Hermippus mentions in his Cercopes, than to be enormously\n rich, and like that whale of Tanagra, as the before mentioned \n men were! But Hermippus uses the following language, addressing Bacchus on the\n present occasion\u2014 \n For poor men now to sacrifice to you \n But maim'd and crippled oxen; thinner far \n Than e'en Thoumantis or Leotrophides. \n And Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, gives a list of the following people\n as very thin, who, he says, were sent as ambassadors by the poets on earth down to\n hell to the poets there, and his words are\u2014 \n \n A. And who is this who dares to pierce the gates \n Of lurid darkness, and the realms o' the dead? \n \n B. We're by unanimous agreement chosen, \n (Making the choice in solemn convocation,) \n One man from each department of our art, \n Who were well known to be frequenters of the Shades, \n As often voluntarily going thither. \n \n A. Are there among you any men who thus \n Frequent the realms of Pluto? \n \n B. Aye, by Jove, \n And plenty; just as there are men who go \n To Thrace and then come back again. You know \n The whole case now. \n \n A. And what may be their names? \n First, there's Sannyrion, the comic poet; \n Then, of the tragic chori, Melitus; \n And of the Cyclic bards, Cinesias. \n And presently afterwards he says\u2014 \n On what slight hopes did you then all rely! \n For if a fit of diarrhea came \n Upon these men, they'd all be carried off. \n And Strattis also mentions Sannyrion, in his Men fond of Cold, saying\u2014\n \n The leathern aid of wise Sannyrion. \n And Sannyrion himself speaks of Melitus, in his play called Laughter,\n speaking as follows\u2014 \n Melitus, that carcase from Lean\u00e6um rising. \n \n \n ","75":"\n And Cinesias was in reality an exceedingly tall and exceedingly thin man; on whom\n Strattis wrote an entire play, calling him the Phthian Achilles, because in his\n own poetry he was constantly using the word \u03c6\u03b8\u03b9\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b1. And accordingly, he, playing on his appearance, continually\n addresses him\u2014 \n \n \u03c6\u03b8\u03b9\u1ff6\u03c4\u02bc \u02bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u1fe6. \u2014 \n But others, as, for instance, Aristophanes, often call him \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, because he took a plank of linden\n wood ( \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 ), and fastened\n it to his waist under his girdle, in order to avoid stooping, because of his great\n height and extreme thin, ness. But that Cinesias was a man of delicate health, and\n badly off in other respects, we are told by Lysias the orator, in his oration\n inscribed, For Phanias accused of illegal Practices, in which he\n says that he, having abandoned his regular profession, had taken to trumping up\n false accusations against people, and to making money by such means. And that he\n means the poet here, and no one else, is plain from the fact that he shows also\n that he had been attacked by the comic poets for impiety. And he also, in the\n oration itself, shows that he was a person of that character. And the words of the\n orator are as follows:\u2014\u201cBut I marvel that you are not indignant at such a man as\n Cinesias coming forward in aid of the laws, whom you all know to be the most\n impious of all men, and the greatest violater of the laws that has ever existed.\n Is not he the man who has committed such offences against the gods as all other\n men think it shameful even to speak of, though you hear the comic poets mention\n such actions of his every year? Did not Apollophanes, and Mystalides, and\n Lysitheus feast with him, selecting one of the days on which it was not lawful to\n hold a feast, giving themselves the name of Cacod\u00e6monist\u00e6, instead of Numeniast\u00e6, a name indeed appropriate enough to their\n fortunes Nor, indeed, did it occur to them that they were really doing what that\n name denotes; but they acted in this manner to show their contempt for the gods\n and for our laws. And accordingly, each of those men perished, as it was\n reasonable to expect that such men should. \n \n But this man, with whom you are all acquainted, the gods have treated in\n such a manner, that his very enemies would rather that he should live than die,\n as an example to all other men, that they may see that the immortal Gods do not\n postpone the punishment due to men who behave insolently towards their Deity,\n so as to reserve it for their children; but that they destroy the men\n themselves in a miserable manner, inflicting on them greater and more terrible\n calamities and diseases than on any other men whatever. For to die, or to be\n afflicted with sickness in an ordinary manner, is the \n common lot of all of us; but to be in such a condition as they are reduced to,\n and to remain a long time in such a state, and to be dying every day, and yet\n not be able to end one's life, is a punishment allotted to men who act as this\n man has acted, in defiance of all human and divine law. And this orator\n used this language respecting Cinesias. \n ","76":"\n Philetas also, the Coin poet, was a very thin man; so that, by reason of the\n leanness of his body, he used to wear balls made of lead fastened to his feet, to\n prevent himself from being blown over by the wind. And Polemo, surnamed\n Periegetes, in his treatise on Wonderful People and Things, says that Archestratus\n the soothsayer, being taken prisoner by the enemy, and being put into the scale,\n was found to weigh only one obol, so very thin was he. The same man also relates\n that Panaretus never had occasion to consult a physician, but that he used to be a\n pupil of Arcesilaus the philosopher; and that he was a companion of Ptolemy\n Euergetes, receiving from him a salary of twelve talents every year. And he was\n the thinnest of men, though he never had any illness all his life. \n But Metrodorus the Scepsian, in the second book of his treatise on the Art of\n Training, says that Hipponax the poet was not only very diminutive in person, but\n also very thin; and that he, nevertheless, was so strong in his sinews, that,\n among other feats of strength, he could throw an empty oil cruise an extraordinary\n distance, although light bodies are not easy to be propelled violently, because\n they cannot cut the air so well. Philippides, also, was extremely thin, against\n whom there is an oration extant of Hyperides the orator, who says that he was one\n of those men who governed the state. And he was very insignificant in appearance\n by reason of his thinness, as Hyperides has related. And Alexis, in his\n Thesprotians, said\u2014 \n O Mercury, sent by the gods above, \n You who've obtained Philippides by lot; \n And you, too, eye of darkly-robed night. \n And Aristophon, in his play called Plato, says\u2014 \n \n A. I will within these three days make this man \n Thinner than e'en Philippides. \n \n B. How so? \n Can you kill men in such a very short time? \n And Menander, in his Passion, says\u2014 \n \n If hunger should attack your well-shaped person, \n 'Twould make you thinner than Philippides. \n And the word \u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 was used for\n being extremely thin, as we find in Alexis; who, in his Women taking Mandragora,\n says\u2014 \n \n A. You must be ill. You are, by Jove, the very \n Leanest of sparrows\u2014a complete Philippides ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n \n B. Don't tell me such strange things: I'm all but\n dead. \n \n A. I pity your sad case. \n At all events, it is much better to look like that, than to be like the\n man of whom Antiphanes in his Aeolus says\u2014 \n This man then, such a sot and glutton is he, \n And so enormous is his size of body, \n Is called by all his countrymen the Bladder. \n And Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that Dinias\n the perfumer gave himself up to love because of his luxury, and spent a vast sum\n of money on it; and when, at last, he failed in his desires, out of grief he\n mutilated himself, his unbridled luxury bringing him into this trouble. \n ","77":"\n But it was the fashion at Athens to anoint even the feet of those men who were\n very luxurious with ointment, a custom which Cephisodorus alludes to in his\n Trophonius\u2014 \n Then to anoint my body go and buy \n Essence of lilies, and of roses too, \n I beg you, Xanthias; and also buy \n For my poor feet some baccaris. \n And Eubulus, in his Sphingocarion, says\u2014 \n . . . . Lying full softly in a bed-chamber; \n Around him were most delicate cloaks, well suited \n For tender maidens, soft, voluptuous; \n Such as those are, who well perfumed and fragrant \n With amaracine oils, do rub my feet. \n But the author of the Procris gives an account of what care ought to be\n taken of Procris's dog, speaking of a dog as if he were a man\u2014 \n \n A. Strew, then, soft carpets underneath the dog, \n And place beneath cloths of Milesian wool; \n And put above them all a purple rug. \n \n B. Ph\u0153bus Apollo! \n \n A. Then in goose's milk \n Soak him some groats. \n \n B. O mighty Hercules! \n \n A. And with Megallian oils anoint his feet. \n \n And Antiphanes, in his Alcestis, represents some one as\n anointing his feet with oil; but in his Mendicant Priest of Cybele, he says\u2014\n \n He bade the damsel take some choice perfumes \n From the altar of the goddess, and then, first, \n Anoint his feet with it, and then his knees: \n But the first moment that the girl did touch \n His feet, he leaped up. \n And in his Zacynthus he says\u2014 \n Have I not, then, a right to be fond of women, \n And to regard them all with tender love, \n For is it not a sweet and noble thing \n To be treated just as you are; and to have \n One's feet anointed by fair delicate hands? \n And in his Thoricians he says\u2014 \n He bathes completely-but what is't he does? \n He bathes his hands and feet, and well anoints them \n With perfume from a gold and ample ewer. \n And with a purple dye he smears his jaws \n And bosom; and his arms with oil of thyme; \n His eyebrows and his hair with marjoram; \n His knees and neck with essence of wild ivy. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Protesilaus, says\u2014 \n Ointment from Peron, which this fellow sold \n But yesterday to Melanopus here, \n A costly bargain fresh from Egypt, which \n Anoints to day Callistratus's feet. \n And Teleclides, in his Prytanes, alludes to the lives of the citizens,\n even in the time of Themistocles, as having been very much devoted to luxury. And\n Cratinus in his Chirones, speaking of the luxury of the former generations, says\u2014\n \n There was a scent of delicate thyme besides, \n And roses too, and lilies by my ear; \n And in my hands I held an apple, and. \n A staff, and thus I did harangue the people. \n \n \n ","78":"\n And Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise on Love Matters, says\u2014\u201cWhy is it that\n we carry in our hands flowers, and apples, and things of that sort? Is it that by\n our delight in these things nature points out those of us who have a desire for\n all kinds of beauty? Is it, therefore, as a kind of specimen of beauty that men\n carry beautiful things in their hands, and take delight in them? Or do they carry\n them about for two objects? For by these means the beginning of good fortune, and\n an indication of one's wishes, is to a certain extent\n secured; to those who are asked for them, by their being addressed, and to those\n who give them, because they give an intimation beforehand, that they must give of\n their beauty in exchange. For a request for beautiful flowers and fruits,\n intimates that those who receive them are prepared to give in return the beauty of\n their persons. Perhaps also people are fond of those things, and carry them about\n them in order to comfort and mitigate the vexation which arises from the neglect\n or absence of those whom they love. For by the presence of these agreeable\n objects, the desire for those persons whom we love is blunted; unless, indeed, we\n may rather say that it is for the sake of personal ornament that people carry\n those things, and take delight in them, just as they wear anything else which\n tends to ornament. For not only those people who are crowned with flowers, but\n those also who carry them in their hands, find their whole appearance is improved\n by them. Perhaps also, people carry them simply because of their love for any\n beautiful object. For the love of beautiful objects shows that we are inclined to\n be fond of the productions of the seasons. \n For the face of spring and autumn is really beautiful, when looked at in their\n flowers and fruits. And all persons who are in love, being made, as it were,\n luxurious by their passion, and inclined to admire beauty, are softened by the\n sight of beauty of any sort. For it is something natural that people who fancy\n that they themselves are beautiful and elegant, should be fond of flowers; on\n which account the companions of Proserpine are represented as gathering flowers.\n And Sappho says\u2014 \n I saw a lovely maiden gathering flowers. \n \n \n ","79":"\n But in former times men were so devoted to luxury, that they dedicated a temple to\n Venus Callipyge on this account. A certain countryman had two beautiful daughters;\n and they once, contending with one another, went into the public roads, disputing\n as they went, which had the most beautiful buttocks. And as a young man was\n passing, who had an aged father, they showed themselves to hi also. And he, when\n he had seen both, decided in favour of the elder; and falling in love with her, he\n returned into the city and fell ill, and took to his bed, and related what had\n happened to his brother, who was younger than he; and he also, going into the\n fields and seeing the damsels himself, fell in love with the \n other. Accordingly, their father, when with all his exhortations he could not\n persuade his sons to think of a higher marriage, brings these damsels to them out\n of the fields, having persuaded their father to give them to him, and marries them\n to his sons. And they were always called the \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9; as Cercidas of Megalopolis says in his Iambics, in the\n following line\u2014 \n There was a pair of \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 women \n At Syracuse. \n So they, having now become rich women, built a temple to Venus, calling\n the goddess \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, as Archelaus also relates\n in his Iambics. \n And that the luxury of madness is exceedingly great is very pleasantly argued by\n Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, where he says\u2014 Thrasylaus\n the Aexonensian, the son of Pythodorus, was once afflicted with such violent\n madness, that he thought that all the vessels which came to the Pir\u00e6us belonged\n to him. And he entered them in his books as such; and sent them away, and\n regulated their affairs in his mind, and when they returned to port he received\n them with great joy, as a man might be expected to who was master of so much\n wealth. And when any were lost, he never inquired about them, but he rejoiced\n in all that arrived safe; and so he lived with great pleasure. But when his\n brother Crito returned from Sicily, and took him and put him into the hands of\n a doctor, and cured him of his madness, he himself related his madness, and\n said that he had never been happier in his life; for that he never felt any\n grief, but that the quantity of pleasure which he experienced was something\n unspeakable. \n \n "},"12":{"0":"\n ANTIPHANES the comic writer, my friend Timocrates, when he was reading one of his\n own comedies to Alexander the king, and when it was plain that the king did not\n think much of it, said to him, The fact is, O king, that a man who is to\n appreciate this play, ought to have often supped at picnic feasts, and must\n have often borne and inflicted blows in the cause of\n courtesans, as Lycophron the Chalcidian relates in his treatise on\n Comedy. And accordingly we, who are now about to set out a discussion on amatory\n matters, (for there was a good deal of conversation about married women and about\n courtesans,) saying what we have to say to people who understand the subject,\n invoking the Muse Erato to be so good as to impress anew on oar memory that\n amatory catalogue, will make our commencement from this point\u2014 \n Come now, O Erato, and tell me truly \n what it was that was said by the different guests about love and about\n amatory matters. \n ","1":"\n For our admirable host, praising the married women, said that Hermippus stated in\n his book about lawgivers, that at Laced\u00e6mon all the damsels used to be shut up in\n a dark room, while a number of unmarried young men were shut up with them; and\n whichever girl each of the young men caught hold of he led away as his wife,\n without a dowry. On which account they punished Lysander, because he left his\n former wife, and wished to marry another who was by far more beautiful. But\n Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise on Proverbs, says,\u2014 In Laced\u00e6mon\n the women, on a certain festival, drag the unmarried men to an altar, and then\n buffet them; in order that, for the purpose of avoiding the insult of such\n treatment, they may become more affectionate, and in due season may turn their\n thoughts to marriage. But at Athens, Cecrops was the first person who married a\n man to one wife only, when before his time connexions had taken place at\n random, and men had had their wives in common. On which account it was, as some\n people state, that Cecrops was called \u03b4\u03b9\u03c6\u03c5\u1f74\u03c2, \n because before his time people did not know who their fathers were, by\n reason of the numbers of men who might have been so. \n \n And beginning in this manner, one might fairly blame those who attributed to\n Socrates two wives, Xanthippe and Myrto, the daughter of Aristides; not of that\n Aristides who was surnamed the Just, (for the time does not agree,) but of his\n descendant in the third generation. And the men who made this statement are\n Callisthenes, and Demetrius Phalereus, and Satyrus the Peripatetic, and\n Aristoxenus; who were preceded in it by Aristotle, who relates the same story in\n his treatise on Nobleness of Birth. Unless perhaps this\n licence was allowed by a decree at that time on account of the scarcity of men, so\n that any one who pleased might have two wives; to which it must be owing that the\n comic poets make no mention of this fact, though they very often mention Socrates.\n And Hieronymus of Rhodes has cited the decree about wives; which I will send to\n you, since I have the book. But Pan\u00e6tius the Rhodian has contradicted those who\n make this statement about the wives of Socrates. \n ","2":"\n But among the Persians the queen tolerates the king's having a number of\n concubines, because there the king rules his wife like her master; and also\n because the queen, as Dinon states in his history of Persia, receives a great deal\n of respect from the concubines. At all events they offer her adoration. And Priam,\n too, had a great many women, and Hecuba was not indignant. Accordingly, Priam\n says\u2014 \n \n \n Yet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came, \n The pledge of many a loved and loving dame. \n Nineteen one mother bore\u2014dead, all are dead! \n \n Iliad, xxiv. 489. \n \n \n \n But among the Greeks, the mother of Ph\u0153nix does not tolerate the concubine of\n Amyntor. And Medea, although well acquainted with the fashion, as one well\n established among the barbarians, refuses to tolerate the marriage of Glauce,\n having been forsooth already initiated in better and Greek habits. And\n Clyt\u00e6mnestra, being exceedingly indignant at a similar provocation, slays\n Cassandra with Agamemnon himself, whom the monarch brought with him into Greece,\n having given in to the fashion of barbarian marriages. And a man may\n wonder, says Aristotle, \"that Homer has nowhere in the Iliad\n represented any concubine as living with Menelaus, though he has given wives to\n every one else. And accordingly, in Homer, even old men sleep with women, such as\n Nestor and Phoenix. For these men were not worn out or disabled in the time of\n their youth, either by intoxication, or by too much indulgence in love; or by any\n weakness of digestion engendered by gluttony; so that it was natural for them to\n be still vigorous in old age. The king of Sparta, then, appears to have too much\n respect for his wedded wife Helena, on whose account he collected all the Grecian\n army; and on this account he keeps aloof from any other\n connexion. But Agamemnon is reproached by Thersites, as a man with many wives\u2014\n \n \n \n 'Tis thine, whate'er the warrior's breast inflames, \n The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames; \n With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow, \n Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow. \n \n Iliad, ii. 220. \n \n \n But it is not natural, says Aristotle, to suppose that all\n that multitude of female slaves were given to him as concubines, but only as\n prizes; since he also provided himself with a great quantity of wine,\u2014but not\n for the purpose of getting drunk himself. \n \n ","3":"\n But Hercules is the man who appears to have had more wives than any one else, for\n he was very much addicted to women; and he had them in turn, like a soldier, and a\n man employed at different times in different countries. And by them he had also a\n great multitude of children. For, in one week, as Herodorus relates, he relieved\n the fifty daughters of Thestias of their virginity. Aegeus also was a may of many\n wives. For, first of all he married the daughter of Hoples, and after her he\n married one of the daughters of Chalcodous, and giving both of them to his\n friends, he cohabited with a great many without marriage. Afterwards he took\n Aethra, the daughter of Pittheus; after her he took Medea. And Theseus, having\n attempted to ravish Helen, after that carried off Ariadne. Accordingly Istrus, in\n the fourteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Athens, giving a catalogue of\n those women who became the wives of Theseus, says that some of them became so out\n of love, and that some were carried off by force, and some were married in legal\n marriage. Now by force were ravished Helen, Ariadne, Hippolyta, and the daughters\n of Cercyon and Sinis; and he legally married Melib\u0153a, the mother of Ajax. And\n Hesiod say that he married also Hippe and Aegle; on account of whom he broke the\n oaths which he had sworn to Ariadne, as Cercops tells us And Pherecydes adds\n Phereb\u0153a. And before ravishing Helen he had also carried off Anaxo from Troy; and\n after Hippolyta he also had Ph\u00e6dra. \n And Philip the Macedonian did not take any women with him to his wars, as Darius\n did, whose power was subverted by Alexander. For he used to take about with him\n three hundred and fifty concubines in all his wars; as\n Dic\u00e6archus relates in the third book of his Life in Greece. But\n Philip, says he, was always marrying new wives in war time. For,\n in the twenty-two years which he reigned, as Satyrus relates in his History of\n his Life, having married Audata the Illyrian, he had by her a daughter named\n Cynna; and he also married Phila, a sister of Derdas and Machatas. And wishing\n to conciliate the nation of the Thessalians, he had children by two Thessalian\n women; one of whom was Nicesipolis of Pher\u00e6, who brought him a daughter named\n Thessalonica; and the other was Philenora of Larissa, by whom he had Arid\u00e6us.\n He also acquired the kingdom of the Molossi, when he married Olympias, by whom\n he had Alexander and Cleopatra. And when he subdued Thrace, there came to him\n Cithelas, the king of the Thracians, bringing with him Meda his daughter, and\n many presents: and having married her, he added her to Olympias. And after all\n these, being violently in love, he married Cleopatra, the sister of\n Hippostratus and niece of Attalus. And bringing her also home to Olympias, he\n made all his life unquiet and troubled. For, as soon as this marriage took\n place, Attalus said, 'Now, indeed, legitimate kings shall be born, and not\n bastards.' And Alexander having heard this, smote Attalus with a goblet which\n he had in his hand; and Attalus in return struck him with his cup. And after\n that Olympias fled to the Molossi; and Alexander fled to the Illyrians. And\n Cleopatra bore to Philip a daughter who was named Europa. \n \n Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in\n his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,\u2014 When some one told Sophocles\n that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but\n in his bed he is very fond of women. ' \n ","4":"\n But our married women are not such as Eubulus speaks of in his Female\n Garland-sellers\u2014 \n By Jove, we are not painted with vermilion, \n Nor with dark mulberry juice, as you are often: \n And then, if in the summer you go out, \n Two rivulets of dark discoloured hue \n Flow from your eyes, and sweat drops from your jaws, \n And makes a scarlet furrow down your neck; \n And the light hair, which wantons o'er your face, \n Seems grey, so thickly is it plastered over. \n \n And Anaxilas, in his Neottis, says\u2014 \n The man whoe'er has loved a courtesan, \n Will say that no more lawless worthless race \n Can anywhere be found: for what ferocious \n Unsociable she-dragon, what Chim\u00e6ra, \n Though it breathe fire from its mouth, what Charybdis, \n What three-headed Scylla, dog o' the sea, \n Or hydra, sphinx, or raging lioness, \n Or viper, or winged harpy (greedy race), \n Could go beyond those most accursed harlots? \n There is no monster greater. They alone \n Surpass all other evils put together. \n And let us now consider them in order:\u2014 \n First there is Plangon; she, like a chimera, \n Scorches the wretched barbarians with fire; \n One knight alone was found to rid the world of her, \n Who, like a brave man, stole her furniture \n And fled, and she despairing, disappear'd. \n Then for Sinope's friends, may I not say \n That 'tis a hydra they cohabit with? \n For she is old: but near her age, and like her, \n Greedy Gnath\u00e6na flaunts, a twofold evil. \n And as for Nannion, in what, I pray, \n Does she from Scylla differ? Has she not \n Already swallow'd up two lovers, and \n Open'd her greedy jaws t' enfold a third? \n But he with prosp'rous oar escaped the gulf. ' \n Then does not Phryne beat Charybdis hollow? \n Who swallows the sea-captains, ship and all. \n Is not Theano a mere Siren pluck'd? \n Their face and voice are woman's, but their legs \n Are feather'd like a blackbird's. Take the lot, \n 'Tis not too much to call them Theban Sphinxes. \n For they speak nothing plain, but only riddles; \n And in enigmas tell their victims how \n They love and dote, and long to be caress'd. \n \n Would that I had a quadruped, says one, \n That may serve for a bed or easy chair. \n \n Would that I had a tripod \u2014 Or a biped, \n \n That is, a handmaid. And the hapless fool \n Who understands these hints, like \u0152dipus, \n If saved at all is saved against his will. \n But they who do believe they're really loved \n Are much elated, and raise their heads to heaven. \n And in a word, of all the beasts on earth \n The direst and most treacherous is a harlot. \n \n \n ","5":"\n After Laurentius had said all this, Leonidas, finding fault with the name of wife\n ( \u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74 ), quoted these verses out of the\n Soothsayers of Alexis\u2014 Oh wretched are we husbands, who have\n sold \n All liberty of life, all luxury, \n And live as slaves of women, not as freemen. \n We say we have a dowry; do we not \n Endure the penalty, full of female bile, \n Compared to which the bile of man's pure honey? \n For men, though injured, pardon: but the women \n First injure us, and then reproach us more; \n They rule those whom they should not; those they should \n They constantly neglect. They falsely swear; \n They have no single hardship, no disease; \n And yet they are complaining without end. \n And Xenarchus, in his Sleep, says\u2014 \n Are then the grasshoppers not happy, say you? \n When they have wives who cannot speak a word. \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Corinthiast, says\u2014 \n O Jupiter, how soft and bland an eye \n The lady has! 'Tis not for nothing we \n Behold the temple of Het\u00e6ra here; \n But there is not one temple to a wife \n Throughout the whole of Greece. \n And Amphis says in his Athamas\u2014 \n Is not a courtesan much more good-humour'd \n Than any wedded wife? No doubt she is, \n And 'tis but natural; for she, by law, \n Thinks she's a right to sulk and stay at home: \n But well the other knows that 'tis her manners \n By which alone she can retain her friends; \n And if they fail, she must seek out some others. \n \n \n ","6":"\n And Eubulus, in his Chrysille, says\u2014 \n May that man, fool as he is, who marries \n A second wife, most miserably perish; \n Him who weds one, I will not blame too much, \n For he knew little of the ills he courted. \n But well the widower had proved all \n The ills which are in wedlock and in wives. \n And a little further on he says\u2014 \n O holy Jove, may I be quite undone, \n If e'er I say a word against the women, \n The choicest of all creatures. And suppose \n Medea was a termagant,\u2014what then? \n Was not Penelope a noble creature? \n If one should say, Just think of Clyt\u00e6mnestra, \n \n I meet him with Alcestis chaste and true. \n Perhaps he'll turn and say no good of Ph\u00e6dra; \n But think of virtuous . . . . who?. . . . Alas, alas! \n I cannot recollect another good one, \n Though I could still count bad ones up by scores. \n \n And Aristophon, in his Callonides, says\u2014 \n May he be quite undone, he well deserves it, \n Who dares to marry any second wife; \n A man who marries once may be excused; \n Not knowing what misfortune he was seeking. \n But he who, once escaped, then tries another, \n With his eyes open seeks for misery. \n And Antiphanes, in his Philopator, says\u2014 \n \n A. He's married now. \n \n B. How say you? do you mean \n He's really gone and married-when I left him, \n Alive and well, possess'd of all his senses? \n And Menander, in his Woman carrying the Sacred Vessel of Minerva, or the\n Female Flute-player, says\u2014 \n \n A. You will not marry if you're in your senses \n When you have left this life. For I myself \n Did marry; so I recommend you not to. \n \n B. The matter is decided\u2014the die is cast. \n \n A. Go on then. I do wish you then well over it; \n But you are taking arms, with no good reason, \n Against a sea of troubles. In the waves \n Of the deep Libyan or Aegean sea \n Scarce three of thirty ships are lost or wreck'd; \n But scarcely one poor husband 'scapes at all. \n And in his Woman Burnt he says\u2014 \n Oh, may the man be totally undone \n Who was the first to venture on a wife; \n And then the next who follow'd his example; \n And then the third, and fourth, and all who followed. \n And Carcinus the tragedian, in his Semele (which begins, O\n nights ), says\u2014 \n O Jupiter, why need one waste one's words \n In speaking ill of women? for what worse \n Can he add, when he once has call'd them women? \n \n \n ","7":"\n But, above all other cases, those who when advanced in years marry young wives, do\n not perceive that they are running voluntarily into danger, which every one else\n foresees plainly; and that, too, though the Megarian poet has given them this warning:\u2014 \n A young wife suits not with an aged husband; \n For she will not obey the pilot's helm \n Like a well-managed boat; nor can the anchor \n Hold her securely in her port, but oft \n \n She breaks her chains and cables in the night, \n And headlong drives into another harbour. \n And Theophilus, in his Neoptolemus, says\u2014 \n A young wife does not suit an old man well; \n For, like a crazy boat, she not at all \n Answers the helm, but slips her cable off \n By night, and in some other port is found. \n \n \n ","8":"\n And I do not think that any of you are ignorant, my friends, that the greatest\n wars have taken place on account of women:\u2014the Trojan war on account of Helen; the\n plague which took place in it was on account of Chryseis; the anger of Achilles\n was excited about Briseis; and the war called the Sacred War, on account of\n another wife (as Duris relates in the second book of his History), who was a\n Theban by birth, by name Theano, and who was carried off by some Phocian. And this\n war also lasted ten years, and in the tenth year was brought to an end by the\n cooperation of Philip; for by his aid the Thebans took Phocis. \n The war, also, which is called the Criss\u00e6an War (as Callisthenes tells us in his\n account of the Sacred War), when the Criss\u00e6ans made war upon the Phocians, lasted\n ten years; and it was excited on this account,\u2014because the Criss\u00e6ans carried off\n Megisto, the daughter of Pelagon the Phocian, and the daughters of the Argives, as\n they were returning from the Pythian temple: and in the tenth year Crissa was\n taken. And whole families also have been ruined owing to women;\u2014 for instance,\n that of Philip, the father of Alexander, was ruined on account of his marriage\n with Cleopatra; and Hercules was ruined by his marriage with Iole, the daughter of\n Eurytus; and Theseus on account of his marriage with Ph\u00e6dra, the daughter of\n Minos; and Athamas on account of his marriage with Themisto, the daughter of\n Hypseus; and Jason on account of his marriage with Glauce, the daughter of Creon;\n and Agamemnon on account of Cassandra. And the expedition of Cambyses against\n Egypt (as Ctesias relates) took place on account of a woman; for Cambyses, having\n heard that Egyptian women were far more amorous than other women, sent to Amasis\n the king of the Egyptians, asking him for one of his daughters in marriage. But he\n did not give him one of his own daughters, thinking that she would not be honoured\n as a wife, but only treated as a concubine; but he sent him Nitetis, the daughter\n of Apries. And Apries had been deposed from the sovereignty\n of Egypt, because of the defeats which had been received by him from the\n Cyreneans; and afterwards he had been put to death by Amasis. Accordingly,\n Cambyses, being much pleased with Nitetis, and being very violently in love with\n her, learns the whole circumstances of the case from her; and she entreated him to\n avenge the murder of Apries, and persuaded him to make war upon the Egyptians. But\n Dinon, in his History of Persia, and Lynceas of Naucratis, in the third book of\n his History of Egypt, say that it was Cyrus to whom Nitetis was sent by Amasis;\n and that she was the mother of Cambyses, who made this expedition against Egypt to\n avenge the wrongs of his mother and her family. But Duris the Samian says that the\n first war carried on by two women was that between Olympias and Eurydice; in which\n Olympias advanced something in the manner of a Bacchanalian, with drums beating;\n but Eurydice came forward armed like a Macedonian soldier, having been already\n accustomed to war and military habits at the court of Cynnane the Illyrian. \n ","9":"\n Now, after this conversation, it seemed good to the philosophers who were present\n to say something themselves about love and about beauty: and so a great many\n philosophical sentiments were uttered; among which, some quoted some of the songs\n of the dramatic philosopher, Euripides,\u2014 some of which were these:\u2014 \n Love, who is wisdom's pupil gay, \n To virtue often leads the way: \n And this great god \n Is of all others far the best for man; \n For with his gentle nod \n He bids them hope, and banishes all pain. \n May I be ne'er mixed up with those who scorn \n To own his power, and live forlorn, \n Cherishing habits all uncouth. \n I bid the youth \n Of my dear country ne'er to flee from Love, \n But welcome him, and willing subjects prove. \n \n And some one else quoted from Pindar\u2014 \n Let it be my fate always to love, \n And to obey Love's will in proper season. \n \n And some one else added the following lines from Euripides\u2014\n \n But you, O mighty Love, of gods and men \n The sovereign ruler, either bid what's fair \n To seem no longer fair; or else bring aid \n To hapless lovers whom you've caused to love, \n And aid the labours you yourself have prompted. \n If you do this, the gods will honour you; \n But if you keep aloof, you will not even \n Retain the gratitude which now they feel \n For having learnt of you the way to love. \n \n \n \n ","10":"\n And Pontianus said that Zeno the Citti\u00e6an thought that Love was the God of\n Friendship and Liberty, and also that he was the great author of concord among\n men; but that he had no other office. On which account, he says in his Polity,\n that Love is a God, being one who cooperates in securing the safety of the city.\n And the philosophers, also, who preceded him considered Love a venerable Deity,\n removed from everything discreditable: and this is plain from their having set up\n holy statues in his honour in their Gymnasia, along with those of Mercury and\n Hercules\u2014the one of whom is the patron of eloquence, and the other of valour. And\n when these are united, friendship and unanimity are engendered; by means of which\n the most perfect liberty is secured to those who excel in these practices. But the\n Athenians were so far from thinking that Love presided over the gratification of\n the mere sensual appetites, that, though the Academy was manifestly consecrated to\n Minerva, they yet erected in that place also a statue of Love, and sacrificed to\n it. \n The Thespians also celebrate Erotidia, or festivals of Love, just as the Athenians\n do Athen\u00e6a, or festivals of Minerva, and as the Eleans celebrate the Olympian\n festivals, and the Rhodians the Hal\u00e6an. And in the public sacrifices, everywhere\n almost, Love is honoured. And the Laced\u00e6monians offer sacrifices to Love before\n they go to battle, thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of\n those who stand side by side in the battle array. And the Cretans, in their line\n of battle, adorn the handsomest of their citizens, and employ them to offer\n sacrifices to Love on behalf of the state, as Sosicrates relates. And the regiment\n among the Thebans which is called the Sacred Band, is wholly composed of mutual\n lovers, indicating the majesty of the God, as these men\n prefer a glorious death to a shameful and dis- creditable life. But the Samians\n (as Erxias says, in his History of Colophon), having consecrated a gymnasium to\n Love, called the festival which was instituted in his honour the Eleutheria, or\n Feast of Liberty; and it was owing to this God, too, that the Athenians obtained\n their freedom. And the Pisistratid\u00e6, after their banishment, were the first people\n who ever endeavoured to throw discredit on the events which took place through his\n influence. \n ","11":"\n After this had been said, Plutarch cited the following passage from the Ph\u00e6drus of\n Alexis:\u2014 \n As I was coming from Pir\u00e6us lately, \n In great perplexity and sad distress, \n I fell to thoughts of deep philosophy. \n And first I thought that all the painters seem \n Ignorant of the real nature of Love; \n And so do all the other artists too, \n Whoe'er make statues of this deity:, \n For he is neither male nor female either; \n Again, he is not God, nor yet is he man: \n He is not foolish, nor yet is he wise; \n But he's made up of all kinds of quality, \n And underneath one form bears many natures. \n His courage is a man's; his cowardice \n A very woman's. Then his folly is \n Pure madness, but his wisdom a philosopher's; \n His vehemence is that of a wild beast, \n But his endurance is like adamant; \n His jealousy equals any other god's. \n And I, indeed,\u2014by all the gods I swear,\u2014 \n Do not myself precisely understand him; \n But still he much resembles my description, \n Excepting in the name. \n And Eubulus, or Ararus, in his Campylion, says\u2014 \n What man was he, what modeller or painter, \n Who first did represent young Love as wing'd? \n He was a man fit only to draw swallows, \n Quite ignorant of the character of the god. \n For he's not light, nor easy for a man \n Who's once by him been master'd, to shake off \n But he's a heavy and tenacious master. \n How, then, can he be spoken of as wing'd? \n The man's a fool who such a thing could say. \n And Alexis, in his Man Lamenting, says\u2014 \n For this opinion is by all the Sophists \n Embraced, that Love is not a winged god; \n \n But that the winged parties are the lovers, \n And that he falsely bears this imputation: \n So that it is out of pure ignorance \n That painters clothe this deity with wings. \n \n \n ","12":"\n And Theophrastus, in his book on Love, says that Chseremon the tragedian said in\n one of his plays, that\u2014 \n As wine adapts itself to the constitution \n Of those who drink it, so likewise does Love \n Who, when he's moderately worshipp'd, \n Is mild and manageable; but if loosed \n From moderation, then is fierce and troublesome. \n \n \n On which account the same poet afterwards, distinguishing his powers with some\n felicity, says\u2014 \n For he doth bend a double bow of beauty, \n And sometimes men to fortune leads, \n But sometimes overwhelms their lives \n With trouble and confusion. \n \n \n \n But the same poet also, in his play entitled The Wounded Man, speaks of people in\n love in this manner:\u2014 \n Who would not say that those who love alone \n Deserve to be consider'd living men? \n For first of all they must be skilful soldiers, \n And able to endure great toil of body, \n And to stick close to th' objects of their love : \n They must be active, and inventive too, \n Eager, and fertile in expedients, \n And prompt to see their way in difficulties. \n \n \n And Theophilus, in his Man fond of the Flute, says\u2014 \n Who says that lovers are devoid of sense? \n He is himself no better than a fool: \n For if you take away from life its pleasures, \n You leave it nothing but impending death. \n And I myself am now indeed in love \n With a fair maiden playing on the harp; \n \n \n \n And tell me, pray, am I a fool for that. \n She's fair, she's tall, she's skilful in her art; \n And I'm more glad when I see her, than you \n When you divide your salaries among you. \n But Aristophon, in his Pythagorean, says\u2014 \n Now, is not Love deservedly cast out \n From his place among the twelve immortal gods? \n For he did sow the seeds of great confusion, \n And quarrels dire, among that heavenly ban \n When he was one of them. And, as he was \n Bold and impertinent, they clipp'd his wing \n That he might never soar again to heaven; \n And then they banished him to us below; \n And for the wings which he did boast before \n Them they did give to Victory, a spoil \n Well won, and splendid, from her enemy. \n Amphis, too, in his Dithyrambic, speaks thus of loving\u2014 \n What say'st thou?\u2014dost thou think that all your words \n Could e'er persuade me that that man's a lover \n Who falls in love with a girl's manners only \n And never thinks what kind of face she's got? \n I call him mad; nor can I e'er believe \n That a poor man, who often sees a rich one, \n Forbears to covet some of his great riches. \n But Alexis says in his Helena\u2014 \n The man who falls in love with beauty's flower, \n And taketh heed of nothing else, may be \n A lover of pleasure, but not of his love; \n And he does openly disparage Love, \n And causes him to be suspect to others. \n \n \n ","13":"\n Myrtilus, having cited these lines of Alexis, and then looking round on the men\n who were partisans of the Stoic school, having first recited the following passage\n out of the Iambics of Hermeas the Curian\u2014 \n Listen, you Stoiclings, traffickers in nonsense \n Punners on words,\u2014gluttons, who by yours \n Eat up the whole of what is in the dishes, \n And give no single bit to a philosopher. \n Besides, you are most clearly proved to do \n All that is contrary to those professions \n Which you so pompously parade abroad, \n Hunting for beauty;\u2014 \n went on to say,\u2014And in this point alone you are imitators of the master\n of your school, Zeno the Ph\u0153nician, who was always a slave to the most infamous\n passions (as Antigonus the Carystian relates, in his History of his Life); for you\n are always saying that the proper object of love is\n not the body, but the mind; you who say at the same time, that you\n ought to remain faithful to the objects of your love, till they are\n eight-and-twenty years of age. And Ariston of Ceos, the Peripatetic, appears to me\n to have said very well (in the second book of his treatise on Likenesses connected\n with Love), to some Athenian who was very tall for his age, and at the same time\n was boasting of his beauty, (and his name was Dorus,) \"It seems to me that one may\n very well apply to you the line which Ulysses uttered when he met Dolon\u2014 \n \n \n Great was thy aim, and mighty is the prize. \n \n Iliad, x. 401. \n \n \n \n ","14":"\n But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that all men love seasoned dishes, but\n not plain meats, or plainly dressed fish. And accordingly, when seasoned dishes\n are wanting, no one willingly eats either meat or fish; nor does any one desire\n meat which is raw and unseasoned. For anciently men used to love boys (as\n Aristophon relates); on which account it came to pass that the objects of their\n love were called \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. And it was with truth\n (as Clearchus says in the first book of his treatise on Love and the Affairs of\n Love) that Lycophronides said\u2014 \n No boy, no maid with golden ornaments, \n No woman with a deep and ample robe, \n Is so much beautiful as modest; for \n 'Tis modesty that gives the bloom to beauty. \n And Aristotle said that lovers look at no other part of the objects of\n their affection, but only at their eyes, in which modesty makes her abode. And\n Sophocles somewhere represents Hippodamia as speaking of the beauty of Pelops, and\n saying\u2014 \n And in his eyes the charm which love compels \n Shines forth a light, embellishing his face: \n He glows himself, and he makes me glow too, \n Measuring my eyes with his,\u2014as any builder \n Makes his work correspond to his careful rule. \n \n \n \n ","15":"\n And Licymnius the Chian, saying that Somnus was in love with Endymion, represents\n him as refusing to close the eyes of the youth even when he is asleep; but the God\n sends his beloved object to sleep with his eyelids still open, so that he may not for a single moment be deprived of the pleasure of\n contemplating them. And his words are these\u2014 \n But Somnus much delighted \n In the bright beams which shot from his eyes, \n And lull'd the youth to sleep with unclosed lids. \n And Sappho says to a man who was admired above all measure for his\n beauty, and who was accounted very handsome indeed\u2014 \n Stand opposite, my love, \n And open upon me \n The beauteous grace which from your eyes doth flow. \n And what says Anacreon?\u2014 \n \n \n Oh, boy, as maiden fair, \n I fix my heart on you; \n But you despise my prayer, \n And little care that you do hold the reins \n Which my soul's course incessantly do guide. \n \n Ode 67. \n \n And the magnificent Pindar says\u2014 \n The man who gazes on the brilliant rays \n Which shoot from th' eyes \n Of beautiful Theoxenus, and yet can feel his heart \n Unmoved within his breast, nor yields to love, \n Must have a heart \n Black, and composed of adamant or iron. \n \n But the Cyclops of Philoxenus of Cythera, in love with Galatea, and\n praising her beauty, and prophesying, as it were, his own blindness, praises every\n part of her rather than mention her eyes, which he does not; speaking thus:\u2014\n \n O Galatea, \n Nymph with the beauteous face and golden hair, \n Whose voice the Graces tune, \n True flower of love, my beauteous Galatea. \n But this is but a blind panegyric, and not at all to be compared with the\n encomium of Ibycus:\u2014 \n Beauteous Euryalus, of all the Graces \n The choicest branch,\u2014object of love to all \n The fair hair'd maidens,\u2014sure the soft-eyed goddess, \n The Cyprian queen, and soft Persuasion \n Combin'd to nourish you on beds of roses. \n And Phrynichus said of Troilus\u2014 \n The light of love shines in his purple cheeks. \n \n \n \n ","16":"\n But you prefer having all the objects of your love shaved and hairless. And this\n custom of shaving the beard originated in the age of Alexander, as Chrysippus\n tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on The Beautiful and on Pleasure. And\n I think it will not be unseasonable if I quote what he says; for he is an author\n of whom I am very fond, on account of his great learning and his gentle\n good-humoured disposition. And this is the language of the philosopher:\u2014\n The custom of shaving the beard was introduced in the time of Alexander,\n for the people in earlier times did not practise it; and Timotheus the\n flute-player used to play on the flute having a very long beard. And at Athens\n they even now remember that the man who first shaved his chin, (and he is not a\n very ancient man indeed,) was given the surname of \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2; \n : on which account Alexis says\u2014\n \n Do you see any man whose beard has been \n Removed by sharp pitch-plasters or by razors? \n In one of these two ways he may be spoken of: \n Either he seems to me to think of war, \n And so to be rehearsing acts of fierce \n Hostility against his beard and chin; \n Or else he's some complaint of wealthy men. \n For how, I pray you, do your beards annoy you?\u2014 \n Beards by which best you may be known as men? \n Unless, indeed, you're planning now some deed \n Unworthy of the character of men. \n And Diogenes, when he saw some one once whose chin was smooth, said,\n 'I am afraid you think you have great ground to accuse nature, for having made\n you a man and not a woman.' And once, when he saw another man, riding a horse,\n who was shaved in the same manner, and perfumed all over, and clothed, too, in\n a fashion corresponding to those particulars, he said that he had often asked\n what a \u02bd\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 was; and now he had found\n out. And at Rhodes, though there is a law against shaving, still no one ever\n prosecutes another for doing so, as the whole population is shaved. And at\n Byzantium, though there is a penalty to which any barber is liable who is\n possessed of a razor, still every one uses a razor none the less for that\n law. And this is the statement of the admirable Chrysippus. \n ","17":"\n But that wise Zeno, as Antigonus the Carystian says, speaking, as it should seem,\n almost prophetically of the lives and professed discipline of\n your sect, said that those who misunderstood and failed rightly to enter\n into the spirit of his words, would become dirty and ungentlemanlike-looking;\n just as those who adopted Aristippus's sect, but perverted his precepts, became\n intemperate and shameless. And the greater portion of you are such as\n that, men with contracted brows, and dirty clothes, sordid not only in your\n dispositions, but also in your appearance. For, wishing to assume the character of\n independence and frugality, you are found at the gate of covetousness, living\n sordidly, clothed in scanty cloaks, filling the soles of your shoes with nails,\n and giving hard names to any one who uses the very smallest quantity of perfume,\n or who is dressed in apparel which is at all delicate. But men of your sect have\n no business to be attracted by money, or to lead about the objects of their love\n with their beards shaved and smooth, who follow you about the Lyceum\u2014 \n Thin, starved philosophers, as dry as leather, \n as Antiphanes calls them. \n ","18":"\n But I am a great admirer of beauty myself. For, in the contests [at Athens] for\n the prize of manliness, they select the handsomest, and give them the post of\n honour to bear the sacred vessels at the festivals of the gods. And at Elis there\n is a contest as to beauty, and the conqueror has the vessels of the goddess given\n to him to carry; and the next handsomest has the ox to lead, and the third places\n the sacrificial cakes on the head of the victim. But Heraclides Lembus relates\n that in Sparta the handsomest man and the handsomest woman have special honours\n conferred on them; and Sparta is famous for producing the handsomest women in the\n world. On which account they tell a story of king Archidamus, that when one wife\n was offered to him who was very handsome, and another who was ugly but rich, and\n he chose the rich one, the Ephori imposed a fine upon him, saying that he had\n preferred begetting kinglings rather than kings for the Spartans. And Euripides\n has said\u2014 \n \n \n Her very mien is worthy of a kingdom. \n \n From the Aeolus. \n \n And in Homer, the old men among the people marvelling at the beauty of\n Helen, are represented as speaking thus to one another\u2014 \n \n \n \n They cried, \"No wonder such celestial charms \n For nine long years have set the world in arms;\u2014 \n What winning graces! what majestic mien! \n She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen.\" \n \n Illiad, iii. 156. \n \n And even Priam himself is moved at the beauty of the woman, though he is\n in great distress. And also he admires Agamemnon for his beauty, and uses the\n following language respecting him\u2014 \n \n \n Say, what Greek is he \n Around whose brow such martial graces shine,\u2014 \n So tall, so awful, and almost divine? \n Though some of larger stature tread the green, \n None match his grandeur and exalted mien. \n \n Ib. iii. 170. \n \n And many nations have made the handsomest men their kings on that\n account. As even to this day that Aethiopian tribe called the Immortals does; as\n Bion relates in his History of the Affairs of Aethiopia. For, as it would seem,\n they consider beauty as the especial attribute of kings. And goddesses have\n contended with one another respecting beauty; and it was on account of his beauty\n that the gods carried off Ganymede to be their cupbearer\u2014 \n \n \n The matchless Ganymede, divinely fair, \n Whom Heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air. \n \n Ib. xx. 234. \n \n And who are they whom the goddesses have carried off? are they not the\n handsomest of men? And they cohabit with them; as Aurora does with Cephalus and\n Clitus and Tithonus; and Ceres with Jason; and Venus with Anchises and Adonis. And\n it was for the sake of beauty also that the greatest of the gods entered through a\n roof under the form of gold, and became a bull, and often transformed himself into\n a winged eagle, as he did in the case of Aegina. And Socrates the philosopher, who\n despised everything, was, for all that, subdued by the beauty of Alcibiades; as\n also was the venerable Aristotle by the beauty of his pupil Phaselites. And do not\n we too, even in the case of inanimate things, prefer what is the most beautiful?\n The fashion, too, of Sparta is much praised, I mean that of displaying their\n virgins naked to their guests; and in the island of Chios it is a beautiful sight\n to go to the gymnasia and the race-courses, and to see the young men wrestling\n naked with the maidens, who are also naked. \n \n ","19":"\n And Cynulcus said:\u2014And do you dare to talk in this way, you who are not\n rosy fingered, as Cratinus says, but who have one foot made of\n cow-dung? and do you bring up again the recollection of that poet your namesake,\n who spends all his time in cookshops and inns? although Isocrates the orator has\n said, in his Areopagitic Oration, But not one of their servants ever would\n have venture to eat or drink in a cookshop; for they studied to keep up the\n dignity of their appearance, and not to behave like buffoons. And\n Hyperides, in his oration against Patrocles, (if, at least, the speech is a\n genuine one,) says that they forbade a man who had dined at a cookshop from going\n up to the Areopagus. But you, you sophist, spend your time in cookshops, not with\n your friends ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd ), but with prostitutes\n ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd ), having a lot of pimps and\n procuresses about you, and always carrying about these books of Aristophanes, and\n Apollodorus, and Ammonius, and Antiphanes, and also of Gorgias the Athenian, who\n have all written about the prostitutes at Athens. \n Oh, what a learned man you are! how far are you from imitating Theomandrus of\n Cyrene, who, as Theophrastus, in his treatise on Happiness, says, used to go about\n and profess that he gave lessons in prosperity. You, you teacher of love, are in\n no respect better than Amasis of Elis, whom Theophrastus, in his treatise on Love,\n says was extraordinarily addicted to amatory pursuits. And a man will not be much\n out who calls you a \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, just as they call\n Aristides and Pausanias and Nicophanes \u03b6\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9. \n And Polemo mentions them, as painting the subjects which they did paint\n exceedingly well, in his treatise on the Pictures at Sicyon. Think, my friends, of\n the great and varied learning of this grammarian, who does not conceal what he\n means, but openly quotes the verses of Eubulus, in his Cercopes\u2014 \n I came to Corinth; there I ate with pleasure \n Some herb called basil (ocimum), and was ruined by it; \n And also, trifling there, I lost my cloak. \n And the Corinthian sophist is very fine here, explaining to his pupils\n that Ocimum is the name of a harlot. And a great many other plays also, you\n impudent fellow, derived their names from courtesans. There is the Thalassa of\n Diocles, the Corianno of Pherecrates, the Antea of Eunicus or Philyllus, the\n Thais, and the Phanion of Menander, the Opara of Alexis, the\n Clepsydra of Eubulus\u2014and the woman who bore this name, had it because she used to\n distribute her company by the hour-glass, and to dismiss her visitors when it had\n run down; as Asclepiades, the son of Areas, relates in his History of Demetrius\n Phalereus; and he says that her proper name was Meticha. \n ","20":"\n \n \n There is a courtesan. . . . . \n (as Antiphanes says in his Clown)\u2014 \n . . . who is a positive \n Calamity and ruin to her keeper; \n And yet he's glad at nourishing such a pest. \n On which account, in the Ne\u00e6ra of Timocles, a man is represented as\n lamenting his fate, and saying\u2014 \n But I, unhappy man, who first loved Phryne \n When she was but a gatherer of capers, \n And was not quite as rich as now she is,\u2014 \n I who such sums of money spent upon her, \n Am now excluded from her doors. \n And in the play entitled Orestantoclides, the same Timocles says\u2014 \n And round the wretched man old women sleep, \n Nannium and Plangon, Lyca, Phryne too, \n Gnath\u00e6na, Pythionica, Myrrhina, \n Chrysis, Conallis, Hieroclea, and \n Lapadium also. \n And these courtesans are mentioned by Amphis, in his Curis, where he\n says\u2014 \n Wealth truly seems to me to be quite blind, \n Since he ne'er ventures near this woman's doors, \n But haunts Sinope, Nannium, and Lyca, \n And others like them, traps of men's existence, \n And in their houses sits like one amazed, \n And ne'er departs. \n \n \n ","21":"\n And Alexis, in the drama entitled Isostasium, thus describes the equipment of a\n courtesan, and the artifices which some women use to make themselves up\u2014 \n For, first of all, to earn themselves much gain, \n And better to plunder all the neighbouring men, \n They use a heap of adventitious aids\u2014 \n They plot to take in every one. And when, \n By subtle artifice, they've made some money, \n They enlist fresh girls, and add recruits, who ne'er \n Have tried the trade, unto their cunning troop, \n And drill them so that they are very soon \n \n Different in manners, and in look, and semblance \n From all they were before. Suppose one's short\u2014 \n They put cork soles within the heels of her shoes: \n Is any one too tall\u2014she wears a slipper \n Of thinnest substance, and, with head depress'd \n Between the shoulders, walks the public streets, \n And so takes off from her superfluous height. \n Is any one too lean about the flank\u2014 \n They hoop her with a bustle, so that all \n Who see her marvel at her fair proportions. \n Has any one too prominent a stomach\u2014 \n They crown it with false breasts, such as perchance \n At times you may in comic actors see; \n And what is still too prominent, they force \n Back, ramming it as if with scaffolding. \n Has any one red eyebrows\u2014those they smear \n With soot. Has any one a dark complexion\u2014 \n White-lead will that correct. This girl's too fair\u2014 \n They rub her well with rich vermilion. \n Is she a splendid figure\u2014then her charms \n Are shown in naked beauty to the purchaser. \n Has she good teeth-then she is forced to laugh, \n That all the bystanders may see her mouth, \n How beautiful it is; and if she be \n But ill-inclined to laugh, then she is kept \n Close within doors whole days, and all the things \n Which cooks keep by them when they sell goats' heads, \n Such as a stick of myrrh, she's forced to keep \n Between her lips, till they have learnt the shape \n Of the required grin. And by such arts \n They make their charms and persons up for market. \n \n \n ","22":"\n And therefore I advise you, my Thessalian friend with the handsome chairs, to be\n content to embrace the women in the brothels, and not to spend the inheritance of\n your children on vanities. For, truly, the lame man gets on best at this sort of\n work; since your father, the boot-maker, did not lecture you and teach you any\n great deal, and did not confine you to looking at leather. Or do you not know\n those women, as we find them called in the Pannuchis of Eubulus\u2014 \n Thrifty decoys, who gather in the money,\u2014 \n Fillies well-train'd of Venus, standing naked \n In long array, clad in transparent robes \n Of thinnest web, like the fair damsels whom \n Eridanus waters with his holy stream; \n From whom, with safety and frugality, \n You may buy pleasure at a moderate cost. \n And in his Nannium, (the play under this name is the work of Eubulus, and\n not of Philippides)\u2014 \n \n For he who secretly goes hunting for \n Illicit love, must surely of all men \n Most miserable be; and yet he may \n See in the light of the sun a willing row \n Of naked damsels, standing all array'd \n In robes transparent, like the damsels whom \n Eridanus waters with his holy stream, \n And buy some pleasure at a trifling rate, \n Without pursuing joys he 's bound to hide, \n (There is no heavier calamity,) \n Just out of wantonness and not for love. \n I do bewail the fate of hapless Greece, \n Which sent forth such an admiral as Cydias. \n \n \n Xenarchus also, in his Pentathlum, reproaches those men who live as you do, and\n who fix their hearts on extravagant courtesans, and on freeborn women; in the\n following lines\u2014 \n It is a terrible, yes a terrible and \n Intolerable evil, what the young \n Men do throughout this city. For although \n There are most beauteous damsels in the brothels, \n Which any man may see standing all willing \n In the full light of day, with open bosoms, \n Showing their naked charms, all of a row, \n Marshall'd in order; and though they may choose \n Without the slightest trouble, as they fancy, \n Thin, stout, or round, tall, wrinkled, or smooth-faced, \n Young, old, or middle-aged, or elderly, \n So that they need not clamber up a ladder, \n Nor steal through windows out of free men's houses, \n Nor smuggle themselves in in bags of chaff; \n For these gay girls will ravish you by force, \n And drag you in to them; if old, they'll call you \n Their dear papa; if young, their darling baby: \n And these a man may fearlessly and cheaply \n Amuse himself with, morning, noon, or night, \n And any way he pleases; but the others \n He dares not gaze on openly nor look at, \n But, fearing, trembling, shivering, with his heart, \n As men say, in his mouth, he creeps towards them. \n And how can they, O sea-born mistress mine, \n Immortal Venus! act as well they ought, \n E'en when they have the opportunity, \n If any thought of Draco's laws comes o'er them? \n \n \n ","23":"\n And Philemon, in his Brothers, relates that Solon at first, on account of the\n unbridled passions of the young, made a law that women might be brought to be\n prostituted at brothels; as Nicander of Colophon also states, in the third book of\n his History of the Affairs of Colophon,\u2014saying that he first\n erected a temple to the Public Venus with the money which was earned by the women\n who were prostituted at these brothels. \n But Philemon speaks on this subject as follows:\u2014 \n But you did well for every man, O Solon; \n For they do say you were the first to see \n The justice of a public-spirited measure, \n The saviour of the state\u2014(and it is fit \n For me to utter this avowal, Solon);\u2014 \n You, seeing that the state was full of men, \n Young, and possess'd of all the natural appetites, \n And wandering in their lusts where they'd no business, \n Bought women, and in certain spots did place them, \n Common to be, and ready for all comers. \n They naked stand: look well at them, my youth,\u2014 \n Do not deceive yourself; a'nt you well off \n You're ready, so are they: the door is open\u2014 \n The price an obol: enter straight\u2014there is \n No nonsense here, no cheat or trickery; \n But do just what you like, and how you like. \n You're off: wish her good-bye; she 's no more claim on you. \n And Aspasia, the friend of Socrates, imported great numbers of beautiful\n women, and Greece was entirely filled with her courtesans; as that witty writer\n Aristophanes (in his Acharnenses ) relates,\u2014saying, that the Peloponnesian war was excited by\n Pericles, on account of his love for Aspasia, and on account of the girls who had\n been carried away from her by the Megarians. \n For some young men, drunk with the cottabus \n Going to Megara, carry off by stealth \n A harlot named Sim\u00e6tha. Then the citizens \n Of Megara, full of grief and indignation, \n Stole in return two of Aspasia's girls; \n And this was the beginning of the war \n Which devastated Greece, for three lewd women. \n \n \n ","24":"\n I therefore, my most learned grammarian, warn you to beware of the courtesans who\n want a high price, because \n You may see other damsels play the flute, \n All playing th' air of Ph\u0153bus, or of Jove; \n But these play no air save the air of the hawk, \n as Epicrates says in his Anti-Lais; in which play he also uses the\n following expressions concerning the celebrated Lais:\u2014 \n But this fair Lais is both drunk and lazy, \n And cares for nothing, save what she may eat \n \n And drink all day. And she, as I do think, \n Has the same fate the eagles have; for they, \n When they are young, down from the mountains stoop, \n Ravage the flocks and eat the timid hares, \n Bearing their prey aloft with fearful might. \n But when they're old, on temple tops they perch, \n Hungry and helpless; and the soothsayers \n Turn such a sight into a prodigy. \n And so might Lais well be thought an omen; \n For when she was a maiden, young and fresh, \n She was quite savage with her wondrous riches; \n And you might easier get access to \n The satrap Pharnabazus. But at present, \n Now that she 's more advanced in years, and age \n Has meddled with her body's round proportions, \n 'Tis easy both to see her and to scorn her. \n Now she runs everywhere to get some drink; \n She'll take a stater\u2014aye, or a triobolus; \n She will admit you, young or old; and is \n Become so tame, so utterly subdued, \n That she will take the money from your hand. \n Anaxandrides also, in his Old Man's Madness, mentions Lais, and includes\n her with many other courtesans in a list which he gives in the following lines:-\n \n \n A. You know Corinthian Lais? \n \n B. To be sure; \n My countrywoman. \n \n A. Well, she had a friend, \n By name Anthea. \n \n B. Yes; I knew her well. \n \n A. Well, in those days Lagisca was in beauty; \n Theolyta, too, was wondrous fair to see, \n And seemed likely to be fairer still; \n And Ocimon was beautiful as any. \n \n \n ","25":"\n This, then, is the advice I want to give you, my friend Myrtilus; and, as we read\n in the Cynegis of Philet\u00e6rus,\u2014 \n Now you are old, reform those ways of yours; \n Know you not that 'tis hardly well to die \n In the embraces of a prostitute, \n As men do say Phormisius perished? \n Or do you think that delightful which Timocles speaks of in his\n Marathonian Women?\u2014 \n How great the difference whether you pass the night \n With a lawful wife or with a prostitute! \n Bah! Where 's the firmness of the flesh, the freshness \n Of breath and of complexion? Oh, ye gods! \n What appetite it gives one not to find \n Everything waiting, but to be constrain'd \n \n To struggle a little, and from tender hands \n To bear soft blows and buffets; that, indeed, \n Is really pleasure. \n And as Cynulcus had still a good deal which he wished to say, and as\n Magnus was preparing to attack him for the sake of Myrtilus,\u2014Myrtilus, being\n beforehand with him (for he hated the Syrian), said\u2014 \n But our hopes were not so clean worn out, \n As to need aid from bitter enemies; \n as Callimachus says. For are not we, O Cynulcus, able to defend\n ourselves? \n How rude you are, and boorish with your jokes! \n Your tongue is all on the left side of your mouth; \n as Ephippus says in his Philyra. For you seem to me to be one of those\n men \n Who of the Muses learnt but ill-shaped letters, \n as some one of the parody writers has it. \n ","26":"\n I therefore, my friends and messmates, have not, as is said in the Aur\u00e6 of\n Metagenes, or in the Mammacythus of Aristagoras, \n Told you of female dancers, courtesans \n Who once were fair; and now I do not tell you \n Of flute-playing girls, just reaching womanhood, \n Who not unwillingly, for adequate pay, \n Have borne the love of vulgar men; \n but I have been speaking of regular professional Het\u00e6r\u00e6\u2014 that is to say,\n of those who are able to preserve a friendship free from trickery; whom Cynulcus\n does not venture to speak ill of, and who of all women are the only ones who have\n derived their name from friendship, or from that goddess who is named by the\n Athenians Venus Het\u00e6ra: concerning whom Apollodorus the Athenian speaks, in his\n treatise on the Gods, in the following manner:\u2014 And they worship Venus\n Het\u00e6ra, who brings together male and female companions ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \n \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 )\u2014that is to say,\n mistresses.

And the verb which they use for\n prostituting oneself for money is \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9, not\n regarding the etymology of the word, but applying a more decent term to the trade;\n as Menander, in his Deposit, distinguishing the \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 from the \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9, says\u2014\n \n You've done an act not suited to companions ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd ), \n But, by Jove, far more fit for courtesans ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd ), \n These words, so near the same, do make the sense \n Not always easily to be distinguished. \n \n \n ","27":"\n But concerning courtesans, Ephippus, in his Merchandise, speaks as follows:\u2014\n \n And then if, when we enter through their doors, \n They see that we are out of sorts at all, \n They flatter us and soothe us, kiss us gently, \n Not pressing hard as though our lips were enemies, \n But with soft open kisses like a sparrow; \n They sing, and comfort us, and make us cheerful, \n And straightway banish all our care and grief, \n And make our faces bright again with smiles. \n And Eubulus, in his Campylion, introducing a courtesan of modest\n deportment, says\u2014 \n How modestly she sat the while at supper! \n Not like the rest, who make great balls of leeks, \n And stuff their cheeks with them, and loudly crunch \n Within their jaws large lumps of greasy meat; \n But delicately tasting of each dish, \n In mouthfuls small, like a Milesian maiden. \n And Antiphanes says in his Hydra\u2014 \n But he, the man of whom I now was speaking, \n Seeing a woman who lived near his house, \n A courtesan, did fall at once in love with her; \n She was a citizen, without a guardian \n Or any near relations, and her manners \n Pure, and on virtue's strictest model form'd, \n A genuine mistress ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ); for the rest of\n the crew \n Bring into disrepute, by their vile manners, \n A name which in itself has nothing wrong. \n And Anaxilas, in his Neottis, says\u2014 \n \n A. But if a woman does at all times use \n Fair, moderate language, giving her services \n Favourable to all who stand in need of her, \n She from her prompt companionship ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 )\n does earn \n The title of companion ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ); and\n you, \n As you say rightly, have not fall'n in love \n \n With a vile harlot ( \u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7 ), but with a\n companion ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ). \n Is she not one of pure and simple manners \n \n B.

And they, on this, immediately came in\n arms, and slew the guards, and made themselves masters of the walls, and\n recovered their freedom; and to show their gratitude to the prostitute they\n built a temple to Venus the Prostitute. \n \n \n And Alexis the Samian, in the second book of his Samian Annals, says\u2014 The\n Athenian prostitutes who followed Pericles when he laid siege to Samos, having\n made vast sums of money by their beauty, dedicated a statue of Venus at Samos,\n which some call Venus among the Reeds, and others Venus in the Marsh. \n And Eualces, in his History of the Affairs of Ephesus, says that there is at\n Ephesus also a temple to Venus the Courtesan ( \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ). And Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on Amatory\n Matters, says\u2014 Gyges the king of the Lydians was very celebrated, not only\n on account of his mistress while she was alive, having submitted himself and\n his whole dominions to her power, but also after she was dead; inasmuch as he\n assembled all the Lydians in the whole country, and raised that mound which is\n even now called the tomb of the Lydian Courtesan; building it up to a great\n height, so that when he was travelling in the country, inside of Mount Tmolus,\n wherever he was, he could always see the tomb; and it was a conspicuous object\n to all the inhabitants of Lydia. And Demosthenes the orator, in his\n Speech against Ne\u00e6ra (if it is a genuine one, which Apollodorus says it is),\n says\u2014 Now we have courtesans for the sake of pleasure, but concubines for\n the sake of daily cohabitation, and wives for the purpose of having children\n legitimately, and of having a faithful guardian of all our household\n affairs. \n \n ","30":"\n I will now mention to you, O Cynulcus, an Ionian story (spinning it out, as\n Aeschylus says,) about courtesans, beginning with the beautiful Corinth, since you\n have reproached me with having been a schoolmaster in that city. It is an ancient\n custom at Corinth (as Cham\u00e6leon of Heraclea relates, in his treatise on Pindar),\n whenever the city addresses any supplication to Venus about any important matter,\n to employ as many courtesans as possible to join in the supplication; and they,\n too, pray to the goddess, and afterwards they are present at the sacrifices. And\n when the king of Persia was leading his army against Greece (as Theopompus also\n relates, and so does Tim\u00e6us, in his seventh book), the Corinthian courtesans\n offered prayers for the safety of Greece, going to the temple of Venus. On which\n account, after the Corinthians had consecrated a picture to the goddess (which\n remains even to this day), and as in this picture they had painted the portraits\n of the courtesans who made this supplication at the time, and\n who were present afterwards, Simonides composed this epigram:\u2014 \n These damsels, in behalf of Greece, and all \n Their gallant countrymen, stood nobly forth, \n Praying to Venus, the all-powerful goddess; \n Nor was the queen of beauty willing ever \n To leave the citadel of Greece to fall \n Beneath the arrows of the unwarlike Persians. \n And even private individuals sometimes vow to Venus, that if they succeed\n in the objects for which they are offering their vows, they will bring her a\n stated number of courtesans. \n ","31":"\n As this custom, then, exists with reference to this goddess, Xenophon the\n Corinthian, when going to Olympia, to the games, vowed that he, if he were\n victorious, would bring her some courtesans. And Pindar at first wrote a panegyric\n on him, which begins thus:\u2014 \n Praising the house which in th' Olympic games \n Has thrice borne off the victory. \n \n But afterwards he composed a scolium on him, which was sung at the sacrificial feasts; in the exordium of Which\n he turns at once to the courtesans who joined in the sacrifice to Venus, in the\n presence of Xenophon, while he was sacrificing to the goddess himself; on which\n account he says\u2014 \n O queen of Cyprus' isle, \n Come to this grove! \n Lo, Xenophon, succeeding in his aim, \n Brings you a band of willing maidens, \n Dancing on a hundred feet. \n And the opening lines of the song were these:\u2014 \n O hospitable damsels, fairest train \n Of soft Persuasion,\u2014 \n Ornament of the wealthy Corinth, \n Bearing in willing hands the golden drops \n That from the frankincense distil, and flying \n \n \n \n To the fair mother of the Loves, \n Who dwelleth in the sky, \n The lovely Venus,\u2014you do bring to us \n Comfort and hope in danger, that we may \n Hereafter, in the delicate beds of Love, \n Reap the long-wished-for fruits of joy, \n Lovely and necessary to all mortal men. \n And after having begun in this manner, he proceeds to say\u2014 \n But now I marvel, and wait anxiously \n To see what will my masters say of me, \n Who thus begin \n My scolium with this amatory preface, \n Willing companion of these willing damsels. \n And it is plain here that the poet, while addressing the courtesans in\n this way, was in some doubt as to the light in which it would appear to the\n Corinthians; but, trusting to his own genius, he proceeds with the following\n verse\u2014 \n We teach pure gold on a well-tried lyre. \n And Alexis, in his Loving Woman, tells us that the courtesans at Corinth\n celebrate a festival of their own, called Aphrodisia; where he says\u2014 \n The city at the time was celebrating \n The Aphrodisia of the courtesans: \n This is a different festival from that \n Which the free women solemnize: and then \n It is the custom on those days that all \n The courtesans should feast with us in common. \n \n \n ","32":"\n But at Laced\u00e6mon (as Polemo Periegetes says, in his treatise on the Offerings at\n Laced\u00e6mon,) there is a statue of a very celebrated courtesan, named Cottina, who,\n he tells us, consecrated a brazen cow; and Polemo's words are these:\u2014 And\n the statue of Cottina the courtesan, on account of whose celebrity there is\n still a brothel which is called by her name, near the hill on which the temple\n of Bacchus stands, is a conspicuous object, well known to many of the citizens.\n And there is also a votive offering of hers besides that to Minerva\n Chalci\u0153cos\u2013a brazen cow, and also the before-mentioned image. And the\n handsome Alcibiades, of whom one of the comic poets said\u2014 \n And then the delicate Alcibiades. \n O earth and all the gods! whom Laced\u00e6mon \n Desires to catch in his adulteries, \n though he was beloved by the wife of Agis, used to go and hold his revels\n at the doors of the courtesans, leaving all the Laced\u00e6monian\n and Athenian women. He also fell in love with Medontis of Abydos, from the mere\n report of her beauty; and sailing to the Hellespont with Axiochus, who was a lover\n of his on account of his beauty, (as Lysias the orator states, in his speech\n against him,) he allowed Axiochus to share her with him. Moreover, Alcibiades used\n always to carry about two other courtesans with him in all his expeditions,\n namely, Damasandra, the mother of the younger Lais, and Theodote; by whom, after\n he was dead, he was buried in Melissa, a village of Phrygia, after he had been\n overwhelmed by the treachery of Pharnabazus. And we ourselves saw the tomb of\n Alcibiades at Melissa, when we went from Synad\u00e6 to Metropolis; and at that tomb\n there is sacrificed an ox every year, by the command of that most excellent\n emperor Adrian, who also erected on the tomb a statue of Alcibiades in Parian\n marble. \n ","33":"\n And we must not wonder at people having on some occasions fallen in love with\n others from the mere report of their beauty, when Chares of Mitylene, in the tenth\n book of his History of Alexander, says that some people have even seen in dreams\n those whom they have never beheld before, and fallen in love with them so. And he\n writes as follows: \u2014 Hystaspes had a younger brother whose name was\n Zariadres: and they were both men of great personal beauty: And the story told\n concerning them by the natives of the country is, that they were the offspring\n of Venus and Adonis. Now Hystaspes was sovereign of Media, and of the lower\n country adjoining it; and Zariadres was sovereign of the country above the\n Caspian gates as far as the river Tanais. Now the daughter of Omartes, the king\n of the Marathi, a tribe dwelling on the other side of the Tanais, was named\n Odatis. And concerning her it is written in the Histories, that she in her\n sleep beheld Zariadres, and fell in love with him; and that the very same thing\n happened to him with respect to her. And so for a long time they were in love\n with one another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their\n dreams. And Odatis was the most beautiful of all the women in Asia; and\n Zariadres also was very handsome. Accordingly, when Zariadres sent to Omartes\n and expressed a desire to marry the damsel, Omartes would not agree to it,\n because he was destitute of male offspring; for he wished\n to give her to one of his own people about his court. And not long afterwards,\n Omartes having assembled all the chief men of his kingdom, and all his friends\n and relations, held a marriage feast, without saying beforehand to whom he was\n going to give his daughter. And as the wine went round, her father summoned\n Odatis to the banquet, and said, in the hearing of all the guests,\u2014'We, my\n daughter Odatis, are now celebrating your marriage feast; so now do you look\n around, and survey all those who are present, and then take a golden goblet and\n fill it, and give it to the man to whom you like to be married; for you shall\n be called his wife.' And she, having looked round upon them all, went away\n weeping, being anxious to see Zariadres, for she had sent him word that her\n marriage feast was about to be celebrated. But he, being encamped on the\n Tanais, and leaving the army encamped there without being perceived, crossed\n the river with his charioteer alone; and going by night in his chariot, passed\n through the city, having gone about eight hundred stadia without stopping. And\n when he got near the town in which the marriage festival was being celebrated,\n and leaving, in some place near, his chariot with the charioteer, he went\n forward by himself, clad in a Scythian robe. And when he arrived at the palace,\n and seeing Odatis standing in front of the sideboard in tears, and filling the\n goblet very slowly, he stood near her and said, '0 Odatis, here I am come, as\n you requested me to,\u2014I, Zariadres.' And she, perceiving a stranger, and a\n handsome man, and that he resembled the man whom she had beheld in her sleep,\n being exceedingly rejoiced, gave him the bowl. And he, seizing on her, led her\n away to his chariot, and fled away, having Odatis with him. And the servants\n and the handmaidens, knowing their love, said not a word. And when her father\n ordered them to summon her, they said that they did not know which way she was\n gone. And the story of this love is often told by the barbarians who dwell in\n Asia, and is exceedingly admired; and they have painted representations of the\n story in their temples and palaces, and also in their private houses. And a\n great many of the princes in those countries give their daughters the name of\n Odatis. \n \n ","34":"\n Aristotle also, in his Constitution of the Massilians, mentions a similar\n circumstance as having taken place, writing as\n follows:\u2014 The Phoc\u00e6ans in Ionia, having consulted the oracle, founded\n Marseilles. And Euxenus the Phoc\u00e6an was connected by ties of hospitality with\n Nanus; this was the name of the king of that country. This Nanus was\n celebrating the marriage feast of his daughter, and invited Euxenus, who\n happened to be in the neighborhood, to the feast. And the marriage was to be\n conducted in this manner: \u2014After the supper was over the damsel was to come in,\n and to give a goblet full of wine properly mixed to whichever of the suitors\n who were present she chose; and to whomsoever she gave it, he was to be the\n bridegroom. And the damsel coming in, whether it was by chance or whether it\n was for any other reason, gives the goblet to Euxenus. And the name of the\n maiden was Petta. And when the cup had been given in this way, and her father\n (thinking that she had been directed by the Deity in her giving of it) had\n consented that Euxenus should have her, he took her for his wife, and cohabited\n with her, changing her name to Aristoxena. And the family which is descended\n from that damsel remains in Marseilles to this day, and is known as the\n Protiad\u00e6; for Protis was the name of the son of Euxenus and Aristoxena. \n \n ","35":"\n And did not Themistocles, as Idomeneus relates, harness a chariot full of\n courtesans and drive with them into the city when the market was full? And the\n courtesans were Lamia and Scione and Satyra and Nannium. And was not Themistocles\n himself the son of a courtesan, whose name was Abrotonum? as Amphicrates relates\n in his treatise on Illustrious Men\u2014 \n Abrotonum was but a Thracian woman, \n But for the weal of Greece \n She was the mother of the great Themistocles. \n But Neanthes of Cyzicus, in his third and fourth books of his History of\n Grecian Affairs, says that he was the son of Euterpe. \n And when Cyrus the younger was making his expedition against his brother, did he\n not carry with him a courtesan of Phoc\u00e6a, who was a very clever and very beautiful\n woman? and Zenophanes says that her name was originally Milto, but that it was\n afterwards changed to Aspasia. And a Milesian concubine also accompanied him. And\n did not the great Alexander keep Thais about him, who was an Athenian courtesan?\n And Clitarchus speaks of her as having been the cause that\n the palace of Persepolis was burnt down. And this Thais, after the death of\n Alexander, married Ptolemy, who became the first king of Egypt, and she bore him\n sons, Leontiscus and Lagos, and a daughter named Irene, who was married to\n Eunostus, the king of Soli, a town of Cyprus. And the second king of Egypt,\n Ptolemy Philadelphus by name, as Ptolemy Euergetes relates in the third book of\n his Commentaries, had a great many mistresses,\u2014namely, Didyma, who was a native of\n the country, and very beautiful; and Bilisticha; and, besides them, Agathoclea,\n and Stratonice, who had a great monument on the sea-shore, near Eleusis; and\n Myrtium, and a great many more; as he was a man excessively addicted to amatory\n pleasures. And Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History, says that there\n are a great many statues of a woman named Clino, who was his cupbearer, in\n Alexandria, clothed in a tunic only, and holding a cornucopia in her hand.\n And are not, says he, the finest houses called by the\n names of Myrtium, and Mnesis, and Pothina? and yet Mnesis was only a female\n flute-player, and so was Pothine, and Myrtium was one of the most notorious and\n common prostitutes in the city. \n \n Was there not also Agathoclea the courtesan, who had great power over king Ptolemy\n Philopator? in fact, was it not she who was the ruin of his whole kingdom? And\n Eumachus the Neapolitan, in the second book of his History of Hannibal, says that\n Hieronymus, the tyrant of Syracuse, fell in love with one of the common\n prostitutes who followed her trade in a brothel, whose name was Pitho, and married\n her, and made her queen of Syracuse. \n ","36":"\n And Timotheus, who was general of the Athenians, with a very high reputation, was\n the son of a courtesan, a Thracian by birth, but, except that she was a courtesan,\n of very excellent character; for when women of this class do behave modestly, they\n are superior to those who give themselves airs on account of their virtue. But\n Timotheus being on one occasion reproached as being the son of a mother of that\n character, said,\u2014 But I am much obliged to her, because it is owing to her\n that I am the son of Conon. And Carystius, in his Historic\n Commentaries, says that Philet\u00e6rus the king of Pergamus, and of all that country\n which is now called the New Province, was the son of a woman named Boa, who was a flute-player and a courtesan, a Paphlagonian by\n birth. And Aristophon the orator, who in the archonship of Euclides proposed a\n law, that every one who was not born of a woman who was a citizen should be\n accounted a bastard, was himself convicted, by Calliades the comic poet, of having\n children by a courtesan named Choregis, as the same Carystius relates in the third\n book of his Commentaries. \n Besides all these men, was not Demetrius Poliorcetes evidently in love with Lamia\n the flute-player, by whom he had a daughter named Phila? And Polemo, in his\n treatise on the colonnade called P\u00e6cile at Sicyon, says that Lamia was the\n daughter of Cleanor an Athenian, and that she built the before-mentioned colonnade\n for the people of Sicyon. Demetrius was also in love with Le\u00e6na, and she was also\n an Athenian courtesan; and with a great many other women besides. \n ","37":"\n And Machon the comic poet, in his play entitled the Chri\u00e6, speaks thus:\u2014 \n But as Le\u00e6na was by nature form'd \n To give her lovers most exceeding pleasure, \n And was besides much favour'd by Demetrius, \n They say that Lamia also gratified \n The king; and when he praised her grace and quickness, \n The damsel answer'd: And besides you can, \n If you do wish, subdue a lioness ( \u03bb\u03ad\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd. ) \n But Lamia was always very witty and prompt in repartee, as also was\n Gnath\u00e6na, whom we shall mention presently. And again Machon writes thus about\n Lamia:\u2014 \n Demetrius the king was once displaying \n Amid his cups a great variety \n Of kinds of perfumes to his Lamia: \n Now Lamia was a female flute-player, \n With whom 'tis always said Demetrius \n Was very much in love. But when she scoff'd \n At all his perfumes, and, moreover, treated \n The monarch with exceeding insolence, \n He bade a slave bring some cheap unguent, and \n He rubbed himself with that, and smear'd his fingers, \n And said, \"At least smell this, O Lamia, \n And see how much this scent does beat all others.\" \n She laughingly replied: \"But know, O king, \n That smell does seem to me the worst of all.\" \n \n But, said Demetrius, \"I swear, by the gods, \n That 'tis produced from a right royal nut.\" \n \n \n ","38":"\n But Ptolemy the son of Agesarchus, in his History of \n Philopator, giving a list of the mistresses of the different kings,\n says\u2014 Philip the Macedonian promoted Philinna, the dancing woman, by whom\n he had Arid\u00e6us, who was king of Macedonia after Alexander. And Demetrius\n Poliorcetes, besides the women who have already been mentioned, had a mistress\n named Mania; and Antigonus had one named Demo, by whom he had a son named\n Alcyoneus; and Seleucus the younger had two, whose names were Mysta and\n Nysa. But Heraclides Lenebus, in the thirty-sixth book of his History,\n says that Demo was the mistress of Demetrius; and that his father Antigonus was\n also in love with her: and that he put to death Oxythemis as having sinned a good\n deal with Demetrius; and he also put to the torture and executed the maidservants\n of Demo. \n ","39":"\n But concerning the name of Mania, which we have just mentioned, the same Machon\n says this:\u2014 \n Some one perhaps of those who hear this now, \n May fairly wonder how it came to pass \n That an Athenian woman had a name, \n Or e'en a nickname, such as Mania. \n For 'tis disgraceful for a woman thus \n To bear a Phrygian name; she being, too, \n A courtesan from the very heart of Greece. \n And how came she to sink the city of Athens, \n By which all other nations are much sway'd? \n The fact is that her name from early childhood \n Was this\u2014Melitta. And as she grew up \n A trifle shorter than her playfellows, \n But with a sweet voice and engaging manners, \n And with such beauty and excellence of face \n As made a deep impression upon all men, \n She 'd many lovers, foreigners and citizens. \n So that when any conversation \n Arose about this woman, each man said, \n The fair Melitta was his madness ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1. )\n Aye, \n And she herself contributed to this name; \n For when she jested she would oft repeat \n This word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1; and when in sport she\n blamed \n Or praised any one, she would bring in, \n In either sentence, this word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1. \n \n So some one of her lovers, dwelling on \n The word, appears to have nicknamed the girl \n Mania; and this extra name prevailed \n More than her real one. It seems, besides, \n That Mania was afflicted with the stone. \n \n \n \n ","40":"\n And that Mania was also excellent in witty repartee, Machon tells us in these\n verses about her,\u2014 \n There was a victor in the pancratium, \n Named Leontiscus, who loved Mania, \n And kept her with him as his lawful wife; \n But finding afterwards that she did play \n The harlot with Antenor, was indignant: \n But she replied,\u2014\"My darling, never mind; \n I only wanted just to feel and prove, \n In a single night, how great the strength might be \n Of two such athletes, victors at Olympia.\" \n They say again that Mania once was ask'd, \n By King Demetrius, for a perfect sight \n Of all her beauties; and she, in return, \n Demanded that he should grant her a favour. \n When he agreed, she turned her back, and said,\u2014 \n \"O son of Agamemnon, now the Gods \n Grant you to see what you so long have wish'd for.\" \n \n On one occasion, too, a foreigner, \n Who a deserter was believed to be, \n Had come by chance to Athens; and he sent \n For Mania, and gave her all she ask'd. \n It happen'd that he had procured for supper \n Some of those table-jesters, common buffoons, \n Who always raise a laugh to please their feeders; \n And wishing to appear a witty man, \n Used to politest conversation, \n While Mania was sporting gracefully, \n As was her wont, and often rising up \n To reach a dish of hare, he tried to raise \n A joke upon her, and thus spoke,\u2014\"My friends, \n Tell me, I pray you by the Gods, what animal \n You think runs fastest o'er the mountain-tops?\" \n \n Why, my love, a deserter, answer'd Mania. \n Another time, when Mania came to see him, \n She laugh'd at the deserter, telling him, \n That once in battle he had lost his shield. \n But this brave soldier, looking somewhat fierce, \n Sent her away. And as she was departing, \n She said,\" My love, don't be so much annoy'd; \n For 'twas not you, who, when you ran away, \n Did lose that shield, but he who lent it you.\" \n Another time they say a man who was \n A thorough profligate, did entertain \n Mania at supper; and when he question'd her, \n \n Do you like being up or down the best \n \n She laugh'd, and said, \"I'd rather be up, my friend, \n For I'm afraid, lest, if I lay me down, \n You'd bite my plaited hair from off my head.\" \n \n \n \n ","41":"\n But Machon has also collected the witty sayings of other courtesans too; and it\n will not be unseasonable to enumerate some of them now. Accordingly he mentions\n Gnath\u00e6na thus:\u2014 \n Diphilus once was drinking with Gnath\u00e6na. \n Said he, Your cup is somewhat cold, Gnath\u00e6na; \n \n And she replied, \"'Tis no great wonder, Diphilus, \n For we take care to put some of your Plays in it.\" \n Diphilus was once invited to a banquet \n At fair Gnath\u00e6na's house, as men do say, \n On the holy day of Venus' festival\u2014 \n (He being a man above her other lovers \n Beloved by her, though she conceal'd her flame). \n He came accordingly, and brought with him \n Two jars of Chian wine, and four, quite full, \n Of wine from Thasos; perfumes, too, and crowns \n Sweetmeats and venison; fillets for the head; \n Fish, and a cook, and a female flute-player. \n In the meantime a Syrian friend of hers \n Sent her some snow, and one saperdes; she \n Being ashamed lest any one should hear \n She had received such gifts, and, above all men, \n Fearing lest Diphilus should get at them, \n And show her up in one of his Comedies, \n She bade a slave to carry off at once \n The salt fish to the men who wanted salt, \n As every one did know; the snow she told him \n To mix with the wine unseen by any one. \n And then she bade the boy to fill the cup \n With ten full cyathi of wine, and bear it \n At once to Diphilus. He eagerly \n Received the cup, and drain'd it to the bottom, \n And, marvelling at the delicious coolness, \n Said\u2014\"By Minerva, and by all the gods, \n You must, Gnath\u00e6na, be allow'd by all \n To have a most deliciously cool well.\" \n \n Yes, said she, \"for we carefully put in, \n From day to day, the prologues of your plays.\" \n A slave who had been flogg'd, whose back was mark'd \n With heavy weals, was once, as it fell out, \n Reposing with Gnath\u00e6na:\u2014then, as she \n Embraced him, she found out how rough all over \n His back did feel. Oh wretched man, said she, \n \n In what engagement did you get these wounds? \n \n He in a few words answered her, and said, \n \"That when a boy, once playing with his playmates, \n He'd fallen backwards into the fire by accident.\" \n \n Well, said she, \"if you were so wanton then, \n You well deserved to be flogg'd, my friend.\" \n Gnath\u00e6na once was supping with Dexithea, \n \n Who was a courtesan as well as she; \n And when Dexithea put aside with care \n Nearly all the daintiest morsels for her mother, \n She said, \"I swear by Dian, had I known \n How you went on, Dexithea, I would rather \n Have gone to supper with your mother than you\" \n When this Gnath\u00e6na was advanced in years, \n Hastening, as all might see, towards the grave, \n They say she once went out into the market, \n And look'd at all the fish, and ask'd the price \n Of every article she saw. And seeing \n A handsome butcher standing at his stall, \n \n Just in the flower of youth,\u2014\"Oh, in God's name, \n Tell me, my youth, what is your price ( \u03c0\u1ff6\u03c2\n \u1f34\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ) to-day?\" \n He laugh'd, and said, Why, if I stoop, three obols. \n \n \n But who, said she, \"did give you leave, you wretch, \n To use your Carian weights in Attica?\" \n Stratocles once made all his friends a present \n Of kids and shell-fish greatly salted, seeming \n To have dress'd them carefully, so that his friends \n Should the next morning be o'erwhelm'd with thirst, \n And thus protract their drinking, so that he \n Might draw from them some ample contributions. \n Therefore Gnath\u00e6na said to one of her lovers, \n Seeing him wavering about his offerings, \n \n After the kids Stratocles brings a storm. \n \n Gnath\u00e6na, seeing once a thin young man, \n Of black complexion, lean as any scarecrow, \n Reeking with oil, and shorter than his fellows, \n Called him in jest Adonis. When the youth \n Answer'd her in a rude and violent manner, \n She looking on her daughter who was with her, \n Said, Ah! it serves me right for my mistake. \n \n They say that one fine day a youth from Pontus \n Was sleeping with Gnath\u00e6na, and at morn \n He ask'd her to display her beauties to him. \n But she replied, \"You have no time, for now \n It is the hour to drive the pigs to feed.\" \n \n \n ","42":"\n He also mentions the following sayings of Gnath\u00e6nium, who was the grand-daughter\n of Gnath$ena:\u2014 \n It happen'd once that a very aged satrap, \n Full ninety years of age, had come to Athens, \n And on the feast of Saturn he beheld \n Gnath\u00e6nium with Gnath\u00e6na going out \n From a fair temple sacred to Aphrodite, \n And noticing her form and grace of motion, \n \n He just inquired How much she ask'd a night? \n \n Gnath\u00e6na, looking on his purple robe, \n And princely bodyguard, said, \"A thousand drachm\u00e6.\" \n He, as if smitten with a mortal wound, \n Said, \"I perceive, because of all these soldiers, \n You look upon me as a captured enemy; \n But take five mince, and agree with me, \n And let them get a bed prepared for us.\" \n She, as the satrap seem'd a witty man, \n Received his terms, and said, \"Give what you like, \n O father, for I know most certainly, \n You'll give my daughter twice as much at night.\" \n There was at Athens once a handsome smith, \n When she, Gnath\u00e6nium, had almost abandon'd \n Her trade, and would no longer common be, \n Moved by the love of the actor Andronicus; \n (But at this moment he was gone away, \n After she'd brought him a male child;) this smith \n Then long besought the fair Gnath\u00e6nium \n To fix her price; and though she long refused, \n By long entreaty and liberality, \n At last he won her over to consent. \n But being but a rude and ill-bred clown, \n He, one day sitting with some friends of his \n In a leather-cutter's shop, began to talk \n About Gnath\u00e6nium to divert their leisure, \n Narrating all their fond love passages. \n But after this, when Andronicus came \n From Corinth back again, and heard the news, \n He bitterly reproach'd her, and at supper \n He said, with just complaint, unto Gnath\u00e6nium, \n That she had never granted him such liberties \n As this flogg'd slave had had allow'd to him. \n And then they say Gnath\u00e6nium thus replied: \n That she was her own mistress, and the smith \n Was so begrimed with soot and dirt that she \n Had no more than she could help to do with him. \n One day they say Gnath\u00e6nium, at supper, \n Would not kiss Andronicus when he wish'd, \n Though she had done so every day before; \n But she was angry that he gave her nothing. \n Said he, on this, \"Gnathena, don't you see \n How haughtily your daughter's treating me?\" \n And she, indignant, said, \"You wretched girl, \n Take him and kiss him if he wishes it.\" \n But she replied, \"Why should I kiss him, mother, \n Who does no good to any one in the house, \n But seeks to have his Argos all for nothing \" \n Once, on a day of festival, Gnath\u00e6nium \n Went down to the Pir\u00e6us to a lover, \n Who was a foreign merchant, riding cheaply \n \n On a poor mule, and having after her \n Three donkeys, three maidservants, and one nurse. \n Then, at a narrow spot in the road, they met \n One of those knavish wrestlers, men who sell \n Their battles, always taking care to lose them; \n And as he could not pass by easily, \n Being crowded up, he cried\u2014\"You wretched man, \n You donkey-driver, if you get not quickly \n Out of my way, I will upset these women, \n And all the donkeys and the mule to boot.\" \n But quick Gnath\u00e6nium said, \"My friend, I pray you, \n Don't be so valiant now, when you have never \n Done any feat of spirit or strength before.\" \n \n \n ","43":"\n And afterwards, Machon gives us the following anec- dotes:\u2014 \n They say that Lais the Corinthian, \n Once when she saw Euripides in a garden, \n Holding a tablet and a pen attach'd to it, \n Cried out to him, \"Now, answer me, my poet, \n What was your meaning when you wrote in your play, \n 'Away, you shameless doer\"' And Euripides, \n Amazed, and wondering at her audacity, \n Said, \"Why, you seem to me to be yourself \n A shameless doer.\" And she, laughing, answer'd, \n \n How shameless, if my partners do not think so I \n \n Glycerium once received from some lover \n A new Corinthian cloak with purple sleeves, \n And gave it to a fuller. Afterwards, \n When she thought he'd had time enough to clean it, \n She sent her maidservant to fetch it back, \n Giving her money, that she might pay for it. \n But, said the fuller, \"You must bring me first \n Three measures full of oil, for want of that \n Is what has hindered me from finishing.\" \n The maid went back and told her mistress all. \n \n Wretch that I am! Glycerium said, \"for he \n Is going to fry my cloak like any herring.\" \n Demophoon once, the friend of Sophocles, \n While a young man, fell furiously in love \n With Nico, called the Goat, though she was old: \n And she had earn'd this name of Goat, because \n She quite devour'd once a mighty friend of hers, \n Named Thallus, when he came to Attica \n To buy some Chelidonian figs, and also \n To export some honey from th' Hymettian hill. \n And it is said this woman was fair to view. \n And when Demophoon tried to win her over, \n \n A pretty thing, said she, \"that all you get \n From me you may present to Sophocles.\" \n \n Callisto once, who was nicknamed the Sow, \n Was fiercely quarrelling with her own mother, \n Who also was nicknamed the Crow. Gnath\u00e6na \n Appeased the quarrel, and when ask'd the cause of it, \n Said, \"What else could it be, but that one Crow \n Was finding fault with the blackness of the other \" \n Men say that Hippe once, the courtesan, \n Had a lover named Theodotus, a man \n Who at the time was prefect of the granaries \n And she on one occasion late in th' evening \n Came to a banquet of King Ptolemy, \n And she'd been often used to drink with him \n So, as she now was very late, she said, \n \"I'm very thirsty, papa Ptolemy, \n So let the cup-bearer pour me four gills \n Into a larger cup.\" The king replied, \n \"You must have it in a platter, for you seem \n Already, Hippe, \n to have had plenty of hay.\" \n A man named Morichus was courting Phryne, \n The Thespian damsel. And, as she required \n A mina, 'Tis a mighty sum, said Morichus, \n \"Did you not yesterday charge a foreigner \n Two little pieces of gold?\" Wait till I want you, \n \n Said she, and I will take the same from you. \n \n 'Tis said that Nico, who was call'd the Goat, \n Once when a man named Pytho had deserted her, \n And taken up with the great fat Euardis, \n But after a time did send again for her, \n Said to the slave who came to fetch her, \"Now \n That Pytho is well sated with his swine, \n Does he desire to return to a goat?\" \n \n \n ","44":"\n Up to this point we have been recapitulating the things mentioned by Macho. For\n our beautiful Athens has produced such a number of courtesans (of whom I will tell\n you as many anecdotes as I can) as no other populous city ever produced. At all\n events, Aristophanes the Byzantian counted up a hundred and thirty-five, and\n Apollodorus a still greater number; and Gorgias enumerated still more, saying\n that, among a great many more, these eminent ones had been omitted by\n Aristophanes\u2014namely, one who was surnamed Paroinos, and Lampyris, and Euphrosyne:\n and this last was the daughter of a fuller. And, besides these, he has omitted\n Megisto, Agallis, Thaumarium, Theoclea (and she was nicknamed the Crow),\n Len\u00e6tocystos, Astra, Gnath\u00e6na, and her grand-daughter Gnath\u00e6nium, and Sige, and\n Synoris (who was nicknamed the Candle), and Euclea, and \n Grym\u00e6a, and Thryallis, and Chim\u00e6ra, and Lampas. But Diphilus the comic poet was\n violently in love with Gnath\u00e6na, (as has been already stated, and as Lynceus the\n Samian relates in his Commentaries;) and so once, when on the stage he had acted\n very badly, and was turned out ( \u1f20\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) of the\n theatre, and, for all that, came to Gnath\u00e6na as if nothing had happened; and when\n he, after he had arrived, begged Gnath\u00e6na to wash his feet, Why do you want\n that? said she; were you not carried ( \u1f20\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) hither? And Gnath\u00e6na was very ready with her\n repartees. And there were other courtesans who had a great opinion of themselves,\n paying attention to education, and spending a part of their time on literature; so\n that they were very ready with their rejoinders and replies. \n Accordingly, when on one occasion Stilpo, at a banquet, was accusing Glycera of\n seducing the young men of the city, (as Satyrus mentions in his Lives,) Glycera\n took him up and said, \"You and I are accused of the same thing, O Stilpo; for they\n say that you corrupt all who come to you, by teaching them profitless and amorous\n sophistries; and they accuse me of the same thing: for if people waste their time,\n and are treated ill, it makes no difference whether they are living with a\n philosopher or with a harlot.\" For, according to Agathon, \n It does not follow, because a woman's body \n Is void of strength, that her mind, too, is weak. \n \n \n ","45":"\n And Lynceus has recorded many repartees of Gnath\u00e6na. There was a parasite who used\n to live upon an old woman, and kept himself in very good condition; and Gnath\u00e6na,\n seeing him, said, My young friend, you appear to be in very good\n case. \n What then do you think, said he, that I should be if I slept\n by myself? \n Why, I think you would starve, said she. Once, when Pausanius, who\n was nicknamed Laccus, was\n dancing, he fell into a cask. The cellar, says Gnath\u00e6na, has\n fallen into the cask. On one occasion, some one put a very little wine\n into a wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. It is very\n Little of its age, said she, to be as old as that. Once\n at a dinking party, some young men were fighting about her, and seating one\n another, and she said to the one who was worsted, Be of good cheer, my boy; for it is not a contest to be decided by crowns, but by\n guineas. There was a man who once gave her daughter a mina, and never\n brought her anything more, though he came to see her very often. Do you\n think, my boy, said she, that now you have once paid your mina,\n you are to come here for ever, as if you were going to Hippomachus the\n trainer? On one occasion, when Phryne said to her, with some\n bitterness, What would become of you if you had the stone? \n I would give it to you, said she, to sharpen your wit\n upon. For it was said that Gnath\u00e6na was liable to the stone, while the\n other certainly wanted it as Gnath\u00e6na hinted. On one occasion, some men were\n drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions ( \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b2\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 ); as the maidservant was clearing the table,\n and putting some of the lentils in her bosom ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd ), Gnath\u00e6na said, She is thinking of making some\n \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7. \n \n \n Once, when Andronicus the tragedian had been acting his part in the representation\n of the Epigoni with great applause, and was coming to a drinking party at her\n house, and sent a boy forward to bid her make preparation to receive him, she\n said\u2014 \n \n O cursed boy, what word is this you've spoken? \n \n And once, when a chattering fellow was relating that he was just come\n from the Hellespont, Why, then, said she, did you not go to\n the first city in that country? and when he asked what city, To\n Sigeum, \n said she. Once, when a man came to see her,\n and saw some eggs on a dish, and said, Are these raw, Gnath\u00e6na, or\n boiled? \n They are made of brass, my boy, said she. On one occasion, when\n Ch\u00e6rephon came to sup with her without an invitation, Gnath\u00e6na pledged him in a\n cup of wine. Take it, said she, you proud fellow. \n And he said, I proud? \n Who can be more so, said she, when you come without even\n being invited? And Nico, who was nicknamed the Goat (as Lynceus tells\n us), once when she met a parasite, who was very thin in consequence of a long\n sickness, said to him, How lean you are. \n No wonder, says he; for what do you think is all that I have\n had to eat these three days? \n Why, a leather bottle, says she, or perhaps your\n shoes. \n \n ","46":"\n There was a courtesan named Metanira; and when Democles the\n parasite, who was nicknamed Lagynion fell down in a lot of whitewash, she said,\n Yes, for you have devoted yourself to a place where there are\n pebbles. And when he sprung upon a couch which was near him,\n Take care, said she, lest you get upset. These\n sayings are recorded by Hegesander. And Aristodemus, in the second book of his\n Laughable Records, says that Gnath\u00e6na was hired by two men, a soldier and a\n branded slave; and so when the soldier, in his rude manner, called her a cistern,\n How can I be so? said she; is it because two rivers,\n Lycus and Eleutherus, fall into me? On one occasion, when some poor\n lovers of the daughter of Gnath\u00e6na came to feast at her house, and threatened to\n throw it down, saying that they had brought spades and mattocks on purpose;\n But, said Gnath\u00e6na, if you had those implements, you\n should have pawned them, and brought some money with you. And Gnath\u00e6na\n was always very neat and witty in all she said; and she even compiled a code of\n laws for banquets, according to which lovers were to be admitted to her and to her\n daughters, in imitation of the philosophers, who had drawn up similar documents.\n And Callimachus has recorded this code of hers in the third Catalogue of Laws\n which he has given; and he has quoted the first words of it as\n follows:\u2014 This law has been compiled, being fair and equitable; and it is\n written in three hundred and twenty-three verses. \n \n ","47":"\n But a slave who had been flogged hired Callistium, who was nicknamed Poor Helen;\n and as it was summer, and he was lying down naked, she, seeing the marks of the\n whip, said, Where did you get this, you unhappy man? and he said,\n Some broth was spilt over me when I was a boy. And she said,\n It must have been made of neats'-leather. And once, when\n Menander the poet had failed with one of his plays, and came to her house, Glycera\n brought him some milk, and recommended him to drink it. But he said he would\n rather not, for there was some \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c2 \n on it. But she replied, Blow it away, and take what\n there is beneath. \n \n Thais said once to a boastful lover of hers, who had borrowed some goblets from a\n great many people, and said that he meant to break them up, and make others of\n them You will destroy what belongs to each private person. Leontium\n was once sitting at table with a lover of hers, when Glycera \n came in to supper; and as the man began to pay more atten- tion to Glycera,\n Leontium was much annoyed: and presently, when her friend turned round, and asked\n her what she was vexed at, she said, \n \u02bd\u1f21 \u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \n pains me. \n \n A lover of hers once sent his seal to Lais the Corinthian, and desired her to come\n to him; but she said, I cannot come; it is only clay. Thais was one\n day going to a lover of hers, who smelt like a goat; and when some one asked her\n whither she was going, she said\u2014 \n To dwell with Aegeus, great Pandion's son. \n Phryne, too, was once supping with a man of the same description, and,\n lifting up the hide of a pig, she said, Take it, and eat it. And once, when one of her\n friends sent her some wine, which was very good, but the quantity was small; and\n when he told her that it was ten years old; It is very little of its\n age, said she. And once, when the question was asked at a certain\n banquet, why it is that crowns are hung up about banqueting-rooms, she said,\n Because they delight the mind. \n And once, when a\n slave, who had been flogged, was giving himself airs as a young man towards her,\n and saying that he had been often entangled, she pretended to look vexed; and when\n he asked her the reason, I am jealous of you, said she,\n because you have been so often smitten. \n Once a very covetous\n lover of hers was coaxing her, and saying to her, You are the Venus of\n Praxiteles; \n And you, said she, are the Cupid of Phidias. \n \n \n ","48":"\n And as I am aware that some of those men who have been involved in the\n administration of affairs of state have mentioned courtesans, either accusing or\n excusing them, I will enumerate some instances of those who have done so. For\n Demosthenes, in his speech against Androtion, mentions Sinope and Phanostrate; and\n respecting Sinope, Herodicus the pupil of Crates says, in the sixth book of his\n treatise on People mentioned in the Comic Poets, that she was called Abydus,\n because she was an old woman. And Antiphanes mentions her in\n his Arcadian, and in his Gardener, and in his Sempstress, and in his Female\n Fisher, and in his Neottis. And Alexis mentions her in his Cleobuline, and\n Callicrates speaks of her in his Moschion; and concerning Phanostrate,\n Apollodorus, in his treatise on the Courtesans at Athens, says that she was called\n Phtheiropyle, because she used to stand at the door ( \u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 ) and hunt for lice ( \u03c6\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 ). \n And in his oration against Aristagoras, Hyperides says\u2014 And again you have\n named, in the same manner, the animals called aphy\u00e6. Now, aphy\u00e6,\n besides meaning anchovies, was also a nickname for some courtesans; concerning\n whom the before-mentioned Apollodorus says\u2014 Stagonium and Amphis were two\n sisters, and they were called Aphy\u00e6, because they were white, and thin, and had\n large eyes. And Antiphanes, in his book on Courtesans, says that\n Nicostratis was called Aphya for the same reason. And the same Hyperides, in his\n speech against Mantitheus, who was being prosecuted for an assault, speaks in the\n following manner respecting Glycera\u2014 Bringing with him Glycera the daughter\n of Thalassis in a pair-horse chariot. But it is uncertain whether this\n is the same Glycera who was take mistress of Harpalus; concerning whom Theopompus\n speaks in his treatise on the Chian Epistle, saying that after the death of\n Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera to come to him from Athens; and when she\n came, she lived in the palace which is at Tarsus, and was honoured with royal\n honours by the populace, and was called queen; and an edict was issued, forbidding\n any one to present Harpalus with a crown, without at the same time presenting\n Glycera with another. And at Rhossus, he went so far as to erect a brazen statue\n of her by the side of his own statue. And Clitarchus has given the same account in\n his History of Alexander. But the author of Agen, a satyric drama, (whoever he\n was, whether it was Python of Catana, or king Alexander himself,) says\u2014 \n And now they say that Harpalus has sent them \n Unnumber'd sacks of corn, no fewer than \n Those sent by Agen, and is made a citizen: \n But this was Glycera's corn, and it may be \n Ruin to them, and not a harlot's earnest. \n \n \n ","49":"\n And Lysias, in his oration against Lais, if, indeed, the speech is a genuine one,\n mentions these circumstances\u2014 Philyra abandoned the trade of a harlot when\n she was still quite young; and so did Scione, and\n Hippaphesis, and Theoclea, and Psamathe, and Lagisca, and Anthea. But\n perhaps, instead of Anthea, we ought to read Antea. For I do not find any mention\n made by any one of a harlot named Anthea. But there is a whole play named after\n Antea, by either Eunicus or Philyllius. And the author of the oration against\n Ne\u00e6ra, whoever he was, also mentions her. But in the oration against Philonides,\n who was being prosecuted for an assault, Lysias, if at least it is a genuine\n speech of his, mentions also a courtesan called Nais. And in his speech against\n Medon, for perjury, he mentions one by the name of Anticyra; but this was only a\n nickname given to a woman, whose real name was Hoia, as Antiphanes informs us in\n his treatise on Courtesans, where he says that she was called Anticyra, because she was in the habit of drinking with men who were crazy and mad;\n or else because she was at one time the mistress of Nicostratus the physician, and\n he, when he died, left her a great quantity of hellebore, and nothing else.\n Lycurgus, also, in his oration against Leocrates, mentions a courtesan named\n Irenis, as being the mistress of Leocrates. And Hyperides mentions Nico in his\n oration against Patrocles. And we have already mentioned that she used to be\n nicknamed the Goat, because she had ruined Thallus the innkeeper. And that the\n goats are very fond of the young shoots of the olive ( \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ), on which account the animal is never allowed to approach\n the Acropolis, and is also never sacrificed to Minerva, is a fact which we shall\n dilate upon hereafter. But Sophocles, in his play called The Shepherds, mentions\n that this animal does browse upon the young shoots, speaking as follows\u2014 \n For early in the morning, ere a man \n Of all the folks about the stable saw me, \n As I was bringing to the goat a thallus \n Fresh pluck'd, I saw the army marching on \n By the projecting headland. \n Alexis also mentions Nannium, in his Tarentines, thus\u2014 \n But Nannium is mad for love of Bacchus,\u2014 \n \n jesting upon her as addicted to intoxication. And Menander,\n in his false Hercules, says\u2014 \n Did he not try to wheedle Nannium? \n And Antiphanes, in his treatise on Courtesans, says\u2014 Nannium was\n nicknamed the Proscenium, because she had a beautiful face, and used to wear\n very costly garments embroidered with gold, but when she was undressed s e was\n a very bad figure. And Corone was Nannium's daughter, and she was nicknamed\n Tethe, from her exceedingly debauched habits. Hyperides, in his oration\n against Patrocles, also speaks of a female flute-player named Nemeas. And we may\n wonder how it was that the Athenians permitted a courtesan to have such a name,\n which was that of a most honourable and solemn festival. For not only those who\n prostituted themselves, but all other slaves also were forbidden to take such\n names as that, as Polemo tells us, in his treatise on the Acropolis. \n ","50":"\n The same Hyperides also mentions my Ocimum, as you call her, O Cynulcus, in his\n second oration against Aristagoras, speaking thus\u2014 As Lais, who appears to\n have been superior in beauty to any woman who had ever been seen, and Ocimum,\n and Metanira. And Nicostratus, a poet of the middle comedy, mentions\n her also in his Pandrosus, where he says\u2014 \n Then go the same way to Aerope, \n And bid her send some clothes immediately, \n And brazen vessels, to fair Ocimum. \n And Menander, in his comedy called The Flatterer, gives the following\n catalogue of courtesans\u2014 \n Chrysis, Corone, Ischas, and Anticyra, \n And the most beautiful Nannarium,\u2014 \n All these you had. \n And Philet\u00e6rus, in his Female Hunter, says\u2014 \n Is not Cereope now extremely old, \n Three thousand years at least? and is not Telesis, \n Diopithes' ugly daughter, three times that? \n And as for old Theolyte, no man \n Alive can tell the date when she was born. \n Then did not Lais persevere in her trade \n Till the last day of her life? and Isthmias, \n Ne\u00e6ra too, and Phila, grew quite rotten. \n I need not mention all the Cossyph\u00e6, \n Gal\u00e6nse, and Coron\u00e6; nor will I \n Say aught of Nais, as her teeth are gone. \n \n And Theophilus, in his Amateur of the Flute, says\u2014 \n Lest he should with disastrous shipwreck fall \n Into Meconis, Lais, or Sisymbrion, \n Or Barathrum, or Thallusa, or any other \n With whom the panders bait their nets for youths, \n Nannium, or Malthace. \n \n \n ","51":"\n Now when Myrtilus had uttered all this with extreme volubility, he added:\u2014May no\n such disaster befal you, O philosophers, who even before the rise of the sect\n called Voluptuaries, yourselves broke down the wall of pleasure, as Eratosthenes\n somewhere or other expresses it. And indeed I have now quoted enough of the smart\n sayings of the courtesans, and I will pass on to another topic. And first of all,\n I will speak of that most devoted lover of truth, Epicurus, who, never having been\n initiated into the encyclic series of learning, used to say that those were well\n off who applied themselves to philosophy in the same way in which he did himself;\n and these were his words\u2014 I praise and congratulate you, my young man,\n because you have come over to the study of philosophy unimbued with any\n system. On which account Timon styles him\u2014 \n The most unlettered schoolmaster alive. \n \n \n Now, had not this very Epicurus Leontium for his mistress, her, I mean, who was so\n celebrated as a courtesan? But she did not cease to live as a prostitute when she\n began to learn philosophy, but still prostituted herself to the whole sect of\n Epicureans in the gardens, and to Epicurus himself, in the most open manner; so\n that this great philosopher was exceedingly fond of her, though he mentions this\n fact in his epistles to Hermarchus. \n ","52":"\n But as for Lais of Hyccara\u2014(and Hyccara is a city in Sicily, from which place she\n came to Corinth, having been made a prisoner of war, as Polemo relates in the\n sixth book of his History, addressed to Tim\u00e6us: and Aristippus was one of her\n lovers, and so was Demosthenes the orator, and Diogenes the Cynic: and it was also\n said that the Venus, which is at Corinth, and is called Mel\u00e6nis, appeared to her\n in a dream, intimating to her by such an appearance that she would be courted by\n many lovers of great wealth;)\u2014Lais, I say, is mentioned by Hyperides, in the\n second of his speeches against Aristagoras. And Apelles the painter, having seen\n Lais while she was still a maiden, drawing water at the\n fountain Pirene, and marvelling at her beauty, took her with him on one occasion\n to a banquet of his friends. And when his companions laughed at him because he had\n brought a maiden with him to the party, instead of a courtesan he said \u2014 Do\n not wonder, for I will show you that she is quite beautiful enough for future\n enjoyment within three years. And a prediction of this sort was made by\n Socrates also, respecting Theodote the Athenian, as Xenophon tells us in his\n Memorabilia, for he used to say\u2014 That she was very beautiful, and had a\n bosom finely shaped beyond all description. And let us, said he,\n go and see the woman; for people cannot judge of beauty by\n hearsay. But Lais was so beautiful, that painters used to come to her\n to copy her bosom and her breasts. And Lais was a rival of Phryne, and had an\n immense number of lovers, never caring whether they were rich or poor, and never\n treating them with any insolence. \n ","53":"\n And Aristippus every year used to spend whole days with her in Aegina, at the\n festival of Neptune. And once, being reproached by his servant, who said to\n him\u2014 You give her such large sums of money, but she admits Diogenes the\n Cynic for nothing; he answered, I give Lais a great deal, that I\n myself may enjoy her, and not that no one else may. And when Diogenes\n said, \"Since you, O Aristippus, cohabit with a common prostitute, either,\n therefore, become a Cynic yourself, as I am, or else abandon her;\" Aristippus\n answered him\u2014 Does it appear to you, O Diogenes, an absurd thing to live in\n a house where other men have lived before you.? \n Not at all, said he. Well, then, does it appear to you\n absurd to sail in a ship in which other men have sailed before you \n By no means, said he. Well, then, replied\n Aristippus, it is not a bit more absurd to be in love with a woman with\n whom many men have been in love already. \n \n And Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his treatise o the People who have been admired\n and eminent in Sicily, says that Lais was a native of Hyccara, which he describe\n as a strong fortress in Sicily. But Strattis, in his play entitled The Macedonians\n or Pausanias, says that she was a Corinthian, in the following lines\u2014 \n \n \n A. Where do these damsels come from, and who are\n they \n \n B. At present they are come from Megara, \n But they by birth are all Corinthians: \n This one is Lais, Who is so well known. \n And Tim\u00e6us, in the thirteenth book of his History, says she came from\n Hyccara, (using the word in the plural number;) as Polemo has stated, where he\n says that she was murdered by some women in Thessaly, because she was beloved by a\n Thessalian of the name of Pausanias; and that she was beaten to death, out of envy\n and jealousy, by wooden footstools in the temple of Venus; and that from this\n circumstance that temple is called the temple of the impious Venus; and that her\n tomb is shown on the banks of the Peneus, having on it an emblem of a stone\n water-ewer, and this inscription\u2014 \n This is the tomb of Lais, to whose beauty, \n Equal to that of heavenly goddesses, \n The glorious and unconquer'd Greece did bow; \n Love was her father, Corinth was her home, \n Now in the rich Thessalian plain she lies;\u2014 \n so that those men talk nonsense who say that she was buried in Corinth,\n near the Craneum. \n ","54":"\n And did not Aristotle the Stagirite have a son named Nicomachus by a courtesan\n named Herpyllis? and did he not live with her till his death? as Hermippus informs\n us in the first book of his History of Aristotle, saying that great care was taken\n of her in the philosopher's will. And did not our admirable Plato love\n Archaianassa, a courtesan of Colophon? so that he even composed this song in her\n honour:\u2014 \n My mistress is the fair Archaianassa \n From Colophon, a damsel in whom Love \n Sits on her very wrinkles irresistible. \n Wretched are those, whom in the flower of youth, \n When first she came across the sea, she met; \n They must have been entirely consumed. \n And did not Pericles the Olympian (as Clearchus tells us in the first\n book of his treatise on Amatory Matters) throw all Greece into confusion on\n account of Aspasia, not the younger one, but that one who associated with the wise\n Socrates; and that, too, though he was a man who had acquired such a vast\n reputation for wisdom and political sagacity? But, indeed, Pericles was always a\n man much addicted to amorous indulgences; and he cohabited\n even with his own son's wife, as Stesimbrotus the Thasian informs us; and\n Stesimbrotus was a contemporary of his, and had seen him, as he tells us in his\n book entitled a Treatise on Themistocles, and Thucydides, and Pericles. And\n Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, tells us that Pericles, being in love with\n Aspasia, used to kiss her twice every day, once when he entered her house, and\n once when he left it. And when she was impeached for impiety, he himself spoke in\n her behalf, and shed more tears for her sake than he did when his own property and\n his own life were imperilled. Moreover, when Cimon had had an incestuous intrigue\n with Elpinice, his sister, who was afterwards given in marriage to Callias, and\n when he was banished, Pericles contrived his recal, exacting the favours of\n Elpinice as his recompense. \n And Pyth\u00e6netus, in the third book of his History of Aegina, says that Periander\n fell violently in love with Melissa, the daughter of Procles of Epidaurus, when he\n had seen her clothed in the Peloponnesian fashion (for she had on no cloak, but a\n single tunic only, and was acting as cupbearer to the young men,) and he married\n her. And Tigris of Leucadia was the mistress of Pyrrhus king of Epirus, who was\n the third in descent from the Pyrrhus who invaded Italy; but Olympias, the young\n man's mother, took her off by poison. \n ","55":"\n And Ulpian, as if he had got some unexpected gain, while Myrtilus was still\n speaking, said:\u2014Do we say \u1f41 \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 in the\n masculine gender? for I know that Philemon says this in his play called Ne\u00e6ra:\u2014\n \n \n A. Just as Seleucus sent the tiger ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd ) here, \n Which we have seen, so we in turn ought now \n To send Seleucus back a beast from here. \n \n B. Let's send him a trigeranum; for that's \n An animal not known much in those parts. \n \n \n And Myrtilus said to him:\u2014Since you interrupted us when we were making out a\n catalogue of women, not like the lists of Sosicrates the Phanagorite, or like the\n catalogue of women of Nil\u00e6netus the Samian or Abderitan (whichever was really his\n native country), I, digressing a little, will turn to your question, my old\n Ph\u0153nix. Learn, then, that Alexis, in his Pyraunus, has said\n \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd, using the word in the mas- culine\n gender; and these are his words: \n Come, open quick the door; I have been here, \n Though all unseen, walking some time,\u2014a statue, \n A millstone, and a seahorse, and a wall, \n The tiger ( \u1f41 \u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 ) of Seleucus. \n And I might quote other evidences of the fact, but I postpone them for\n the present, while I finish my catalogue, as far as it comprehends the beautiful\n women. \n ","56":"\n For Clearchus speaks thus concerning Epaminondas: Epaminondas the Theban\n behaved with more dignity than these men did; but still there was a want of\n dignity in the way in which he was induced to waver in his sentiments in his\n association with women, as any one will admit who considers his conduct with\n the wife of Lacon. But Hyperides the orator, having driven his son\n Glaucippus out of his house, received into it that most extravagant courtesan\n Myrrhina, and kept her in the city; and he also kept Aristagora in the Pir\u00e6us, and\n Phila at Eleusis, whom he bought for a very large sum, and then emancipated; and\n after that he made her his housekeeper, as Idomeneus relates. But, in his oration\n in defence of Phryne, Hyperides confesses that he is in love with the woman; and\n yet, before he had got cured of that love, he introduced the above-mentioned\n Myrrhina into his house. \n ","57":"\n Now Phryne was a native of Thespi\u00e6; and being prosecuted by Euthias on a capital\n charge, she was acquitted: on which account Euthias was so indignant that he never\n instituted any prosecution afterwards, as Hermippus tells us. But Hyperides, when\n pleading Phryne's cause, as he did not succeed at all, but it was plain that the\n judges were about to condemn her, brought her forth into the middle of the court,\n and, tearing open her tunic and displaying her naked bosom, employed all the end\n of his speech, with the highest oratorical art, to excite the pity of her judges\n by the sight of her beauty, and inspired the judges with a superstitious fear, so\n that they were so moved by pity as not to be able to stand the idea of condemning\n to death a prophetess and priestess of Venus. And when she was\n acquitted, a decree was drawn up in the following form: That hereafter no\n orator should endeavour to excite pity on behalf of any \n one, and that no man or woman, when impeached, shall have his or her case\n decided on while present. \n \n But Phryne was a really beautiful woman, even in those parts of her person which\n were not generally seen: on which account it was not easy to see her naked; for\n she used to wear a tunic which covered her whole person, and she never used the\n public baths. But on the solemn assembly of the Eleusinian festival, and on the\n feast of the Posidonia, then she laid aside her garments in the sight of all the\n assembled Greeks, and having undone her hair, she went to bathe in the sea; and it\n was from her that Apelles took his picture of the Venus Anadyomene; and Praxiteles\n the statuary, who was a lover of hers, modelled the Cnidian Venus from her body;\n and on the pedestal of his statue of Cupid, which is placed below the stage in the\n theatre, he wrote the following inscription:\u2014 \n Praxiteles has devoted earnest care \n To representing all the love he felt, \n Drawing his model from his inmost heart: \n I gave myself to Phryne for her wages, \n And now I no more charms employ, nor arrows, \n Save those of earnest glances at my love. \n And he gave Phryne the choice of his statues, whether she chose to take\n the Cupid, or the Satyrus which is in the street called the Tripods; and she,\n having chosen the Cupid, consecrated it in the temple at Thespi\u00e6. And the people\n of her neighbourhood, having had a statue made of Phryne herself, of solid gold,\n consecrated it in the temple of Delphi, having had it placed on a pillar of\n Pentelican marble; and the statue was made by Praxiteles. And when Crates the\n Cynic saw it, he called it a votive offering of the profligacy of\n Greece. And this statue stood in the middle between that of Archidamus,\n king of the Laced\u00e6monians, and that of Philip the son of Amyntas; and it bore this\n inscription\u2014 Phryne of Thespi\u00e6, the daughter of Epicles, as we are\n told by Alcetas, in the second book of his treatise on the Offerings at\n Delphi. \n ","58":"\n But Apollodorus, in his book on Courtesans, says that there were two women named\n Phryne, one of whom was nicknamed Clausigelos, and the other\n Saperdium. But Herodicus, in the sixth book of his Essay on\n People mentioned by the Comic Poets, says that the one who is mentioned by the\n orators was called Sestos, because she sifted ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03ae\u03b8\u03c9 ) and stripped bare all her lovers; and that the other was\n the native of Thespi\u00e6. But Phryne was exceedingly rich, and she offered to build a\n wall round Thebes, if the Thebans would inscribe on the wall, Alexander\n destroyed this wall, but Phryne the courtesan restored it; as\n Callistratus states in his treatise on Courtesans. And Timocles the comic poet, in\n his Ne\u00e6ra, has mentioned her riches (the passage has been already cited); and so\n has Amphis, in his Curis. And Gryllion was a parasite of Phryne's, though he was\n one of the judges of the Areopagus; as also Satyrus, the Olynthian actor, was a\n parasite of Pamphila. But Aristogiton, in his book against Phryne, says that her\n proper name was Mnesarete; and I am aware that Diodorus Periegetes says that the\n oration against her which is ascribed to Euthias, is really the work of\n Anaximenes. But Posidippus the comic poet, in his Ephesian Women, speaks in the\n following manner concerning her:\u2014 \n Before our time, the Thespian Phryne was \n Far the most famous of all courtesans; \n And even though you're later than her age, \n Still you have heard of the trial which she stood. \n She was accused on a capital charge \n Before the Heli\u00e6a, being said \n To have corrupted all the citizens; \n But she besought the judges separately \n With tears, and so just saved herself from judgment. \n \n \n ","59":"\n And I would have you all to know that Democles, the orator, became the father of\n Demeas, by a female flute-player who was a courtesan; and once when he, Demeas,\n was giving himself airs in the tribune, Hyperides stepped his mouth, saying,\n Will not you be silent, young man? why, you make more puffing than your\n mother did. And also Bion of the Borysthenes, the philosopher, was the\n son of a Laced$emonian courtesan named Olympia; as Nicias the Nic\u00e6an informs us in\n his treatise called the Successions of the Philosophers. And Sophocles the\n tragedian, when he was an old man, was a lover of Theoris the courtesan; and\n accordingly, supplicating the favour and assistance of Venus, he says\u2014 \n \n Hear me now praying, goddess, nurse of youths, \n And grant that this my love may scorn young men, \n And their most feeble fancies and embraces; \n And rather cling to grey-headed old men, \n Whose minds are vigorous, though their limbs be weak. \n And these verses are some of those which are at time attributed to Homer.\n But he mentions Theoris by name, speaking thus in one of his plain choruses:\u2014\n \n For dear to me Theoris is. \n And towards the end of his life, as Hegesander says, he was a lover of\n the courtesan Archippa, and he left her the heiress of all his property; but as\n Archippa cohabited with Sophocles, though he was very old, Smicrines, her former\n lover, being asked by some one what Archippa was doing, said very wittily,\n Why, like the owls, she is sitting on the tombs. \n \n ","60":"\n But Isocrates also, the most modest of all the orators, had a mistress named\n Metanira, who was very beautiful, as Lysias relates in his Letters. But\n Demosthenes, in his oration against Ne\u00e6ra, says that Metanira was the mistress of\n Lysias. And Lysias also was desperately in love with Lagis the courtesan, whose\n panegyric Cephalus the orator wrote, just as Alcidamas the El\u00e6an, the pupil of\n Gorgias, himself wrote a panegyric on the courtesan Nais. And, in his oration\n against Philonides, who was under prosecution for an assault, (if, at least, the\n oration be a genuine one,) Lysias says that Nais was the mistress of Philonides,\n writing as follows:\u2014 There is then a woman who is a courtesan, Nais by name,\n whose keeper is Archias; but your friend Philonides states himself to be in\n love with her. Aristophanes also mentions her in his Gerytades, and\n perhaps also in his Plutus, where he says\u2014 \n Is it not owing to you the greedy Lais \n Does love Philonides \n For perhaps here we ought to read Nais, and not Lais. But Hermippus, in\n his Essay on Isocrates, says that Isocrates, when he was advancing in years, took\n the courtesan Lagisca to his house, and had a daughter by her. And Strattis speaks\n of her in these lines:\u2014 \n And while she still was in her bed, I saw \n Isocrates' concubine, Lagisca, \n Playing her tricks; and with her the flute-maker. \n \n And Lysias, in his speech against Lais, (if, at least, the\n oration be a genuine one,) mentions her, giving a list of other courtesans also,\n in the following words:\u2014\"Philyra indeed abandoned the trade of a courtesan while\n she was still young; and Scione, and Hippaphesis, and Theoclea, and Psamathe, and\n Lagisca, and Anthea, and Aristoclea, all abandoned it also at an early age.\" \n ","61":"\n But it is reported that Demosthenes the orator had children by a courtesan; at all\n events he himself, in his speech about gold, introduced his children before the\n court, in order to obtain pity by their means, without their mother; although it\n was customary to bring forward the wives of those who were on their trial;\n however, he did this for shame's sake, hoping to avoid calumny. But this orator\n was exceedingly addicted to amorous indulgences, as Idomeneus tells us.\n Accordingly, being in love with a youth named Aristarchus, he once, when he was\n intoxicated, insulted Nicodemus on his account, and struck out his eyes. He is\n related also to have been very extravagant in his table, and his followers, and in\n women. Therefore, his secretary once said, But what can any one say of\n Demosthenes? For everything that he has thought of for a whole year, is all\n thrown into confusion by one woman in one night. Accordingly, he is\n said to have received into his house a youth named Cnosion, although he had a\n wife; and she, being indignant at this, went herself and slept with Cnosion. \n ","62":"\n And Demetrius the king, the last of all Alexander's successors, had a mistress\n named Myrrhina, a Samian courtesan; and in every respect but the crown, he made\n her his partner in the kingdom, as Nicolaus of Damascus tells us. And Ptolemy the\n son of Ptolemy Philadelphus the king, who was governor of the garrison in Ephesus,\n had a mistress named Irene. And she, when plots were laid against Ptolemy by the\n Thracians at Ephesus, and when he fled to the temple of Diana, fled with him: and\n when the conspirators had murdered him, Irene seizing hold of the bars of the\n doors of the temple, sprinkled the altar with his blood till they slew her also.\n And Sophron the governor of Ephesus had a mistress, Danae, the daughter of\n Leontium the Epicurean, who was also a courtesan herself. And by her means he was\n saved when a plot was laid against him by Laodice, and Laodice was thrown down a precipice, as Phylarchus relates in his twelfth book in\n these words: \u201cDanae was a chosen companion of Laodice, and was trusted by her with\n all her secrets; and, being the daughter of that Leontium who had studied with\n Epicurus the natural philosopher, and having been herself formerly the mistress of\n Sophron, she, perceiving that Laodice was laying a plot to murder Sophron,\n revealed the plot to Sophron by a sign. And he, understanding the sign, and\n pretending to agree to what she was saying to him, asked two days to deliberate on\n what he should do. And, when she had agreed to that, he fled away by night to\n Ephesus. But Laodice, when she learnt what had been done by Danae, threw her down\n a precipice, discarding all recollection of their former friendship. And they say\n that Danae, when she perceived the danger which was impending over her, was\n interrogated by Laodice, and refused to give her any answer; but, when she was\n dragged to the precipice, then she said, that many people justly despise\n the Deity, and they may justify themselves by my case, who having saved a man\n who was to me as my husband, am requited in this manner by the Deity. But\n Laodice, who murdered her husband, is thought worthy of such honour. \n \n The same Phylarchus also speaks of Mysta, in his fourteenth book, in these terms:\n Mysta was the mistress of Seleucus the king, and when Seleucus was\n defeated by the Galat\u00e6, and was with difficulty able to save himself by flight,\n she put off the robes of a queen which she had been accustomed to wear, and\n assumed the garment of an ordinary servant; and being taken prisoner, was\n carried away with the rest of the captives. And being sold in the same manner\n as her handmaidens, she came to Rhodes; and there, when she had revealed who\n she was, she was sent back with great honour to Seleucus by the\n Rhodians. \n \n ","63":"\n But Demetrius Phalereus being in love with Lampito, a courtesan of Samos, was\n pleased when he himself was addressed as Lampito, as Diyllus tells us; and he also\n had himself called Charitoblepharos. And Nicarete\n the courtesan was the mistress of Stephanus the orator; and Metanira was the\n mistress of Lysias the sophist; and these women were the\n slaves of Casius the Elean, with many other such, as Antea, Stratola, Aristoclea,\n Phila, Isthmias, and Ne\u00e6ra. But Ne\u00e6ra was the mistress of Stratoclides, and also\n of Xenoclides the poet, and of Hipparchus the actor, and of Phrynion the P\u00e6anian,\n who was the son of Demon and the nephew of Demochares. And Phrynichus. and\n Stephanus the orator used to have Ne\u00e6ra in turn, each a day, since their friends\n had so arbitrated the matter for them; and the daughter of Ne\u00e6ra, whose name was\n Strymbela, and who was afterwards called Phano, Stephanus gave (as if she had been\n his own daughter) in marriage to Phrastor of Aegialea; as Demosthenes tells us in\n his oration against Ne\u00e6ra. And he also speaks in the following manner about Sinope\n the courtesan: And you punished Archias the hierophant, when he was\n convicted before the regular tribunals of behaving with impiety, and offering\n sacrifices which were contrary to the laws of the nation. And he was accused\n also of other things, and among them of having sacrificed a victim on the\n festival of Ceres, which was offered by Sinope the courtesan, on the altar\n which is in the court of the temple at Eleusis, though it is against the law to\n sacrifice any victims on that day; and though, too, it was no part of his duty\n to sacrifice at all, but it belonged to the priestess to do so. \n \n ","64":"\n Plangon the Milesian was also a celebrated courtesan; and she, as she was most\n wonderfully beautiful, was beloved by a young man of Colophon, who had a mistress\n already whose name was Bacchis. Accordingly, when this young man began to address\n his solicitations to Plangon, she, having heard of. the beauty of Bacchis, and\n wishing to make the young man abandon his love for her, when she was unable to\n effect that, she required as the price of her favours the necklace of Bacchis,\n which was very celebrated. And he, as he was exceedingly in love, entreated\n Bacchis not to see him totally overwhelmed with despair; and Bacchis, seeing the\n excited state of the young man, gave him the necklace. And Plangon, when she saw\n the freedom from jealousy which was exhibited by Bacchis, sent her back the\n necklace, but kept the young man: and ever after Plangon and Bacchis were friends,\n loving the young man in common; and the Ionians being amazed at this, as Menetor\n tells us in his treatise concerning Offerings, gave Plangon the name of Pasiphila. And Archilochus mentions her in the, following lines:\u2014\n \n As a fig-tree planted on a lofty rock \n Feeds many crows and jackdaws, so Pasiphila's \n A willing entertainer of all strangers. \n \n \n That Menander the poet was a lover of Glycera, is notorious to everybody; but\n still he was not well pleased with her. For when Philemon was in love with a\n courtesan, and in one of his plays called her Excellent, Menander,\n in one of his plays, said, in contradiction to this, that there was no courtesan\n who was good. \n ","65":"\n And Harpalus the Macedonian, who robbed Alexander of vast sums of money and then\n fled to Athens, being in love with Pythionica, spent an immense deal of money on\n her; and she was a courtesan. And when she died he erected a monument to her which\n cost him many talents. And as he was carrying her out to burial, as Posidonius\n tells us in the twenty-second book of his History, he had the body accompanied\n with a band of the most eminent artists of all kinds, and with all sorts of\n musical instruments and songs. And Dic\u00e6archus, in his Essay on the Descent to the\n Cave of Trophonius, says,\u2014 And that same sort of thing may happen to any one\n who goes to the city of the Athenians, and who proceeds by the road leading\n from Eleusis, which is called the Sacred Road; for, if he stops at that point\n from which he first gets a sight of Athens, and of the temple, and of the\n citadel, he will see a tomb built by the wayside, of such a size that there is\n none other near which can be compared with it for magnitude. And at first, as\n would be natural, he would pronounce it to be the tomb, beyond all question, of\n Miltiades, or Cimon, or Pericles, or of some other of the great men of Athens.\n And above all, he would feel sure that it had been erected by the city at the\n public expense; or at all events by some public decree; and then, again, when\n he heard it was the tomb of Pythionica the courtesan, what must be his\n feelings? \n \n And Theopompus also, in his letter to Alexander, speaking reproachfully of the\n profligacy of Harpalus, says,\u2014 But just consider and listen to the truth, as\n you may hear from the people of Babylon, as to the manner in which he treated\n Pythionica when she was dead; who was originally the slave of Bacchis, the female flute-player. And Bacchis herself had\n been the slave of Sinope the Thracian, who brought her establishment of harlots\n from Aegina to Athens; so that she was not only trebly a slave, but also trebly\n a harlot. He, however, erected two monuments to her at an expense exceeding two\n hundred talents. And every one marvelled that no one of all those who died in\n Cilicia, in defence of your dominions and of the freedom of the Greeks, had had\n any tomb adorned for them either by him or by any other of the governors of the\n state; but that a tomb should be erected to Pythionica the courtesan, both in\n Athens and in Babylon; and they have now stood a long time. For a man who\n ventured to call himself a friend to you, has dared to consecrate a temple and\n a spot of ground to a woman whom everybody knew to have been common to every\n one who chose at the same fixed price, and to call both the temple and the\n altar those of Pythionica Venus; and in so doing, he despised also the\n vengeance of the Gods, and endeavoured to insult the honours to which you are\n entitled. Philemon also mentions these circumstances, in his comedy\n called the Babylonian, where he says\u2014 \n You shall be queen of Babylon if the Fates \n Will but permit it. Sure you recollect \n Pythionica and proud Harpalus. \n Alexis also mentions her in his Lyciscus. \n ","66":"\n But after the death of Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera, and she also was a\n courtesan, as Theopompus relates, when he says that Harpalus issued an edict that\n no one should present him with a crown, without at the same time paying a similar\n compliment to his prostitute; and adds,\u2014 He has also erected a brazen\n statue to Glycera in Rhossus of Syria, where he intends to erect one of you,\n and another of himself. And he has permitted her to dwell in the palace in\n Tarsus, and he permits her to receive adoration from the people, and to bear\n the title of Queen, and to be complimented with other presents, which are only\n fit for your own mother and your own wife. And we have a testimony\n coinciding with this from the author of the Satyric drama called Agen, which was\n exhibited, on the occasion when the Dionysian festival was celebrated on the banks\n of the river Hydaspes, by the author, whether he was Pythen of Catana or\n Byzantium, or the king himself. And it was exhibited when Harpalus was now flying to the sea-shore, after he had revolted; and it\n mentions Pythionica as already dead; and Glycera, as being with Harpalus, and as\n being the person who encouraged the Athenians to receive presents from Harpalus.\n And the verses of the play are as follows:\u2014 \n \n A. There is a pinnacle, where never birds \n Have made their nests, where the long reeds do grow; \n And on the left is the illustrious temple \n Raised to a courtesan, which Pallides \n Erected, but repenting of the deed, \n Condemn'd himself for it to banishment. \n And when some magi of the barbarians \n Saw him oppressed with the stings of conscience, \n They made him trust that they could raise again \n The soul of Pythionica. \n And the author of the play calls Harpalus Pallides in this passage; but\n in what follows, he speaks of him by his real name, saying\u2014 \n \n B. But I do wish to learn from you, since I \n Dwell a long way from thence, what is the fate \n At present of the land of Athens; and \n How all its people fare? \n \n A. Why, when they said \n That they were slaves, they plenty had to eat, \n But now they have raw vegetables only, \n And fennel, and but little corn or meat. \n \n B. I likewise hear that Harpalus has sent them \n A quantity of corn no less than Agen, \n And has been made a citizen of Athens. \n That corn was Glycera's. But it is perhaps \n To them a pledge of ruin, not of a courtesan. \n \n \n ","67":"\n Naucratis also has produced some very celebrated courtesans of exceeding beauty;\n for instance, Doricha, whom the beautiful Sappho, as she became the mistress of\n her brother Charaxus, who had gone to Naucratis on some mercantile business,\n accuses in her poetry of having stripped Charaxus of a great deal of his property.\n But Herodots calls her Rhodopis, being evidently ignorant that Rhodopis and\n Doricha were two different people; and it was Rhodopis who dedicated those\n celebrated spits at Delphi, which Cratinus mentions in the following lines\u2014 \n * * * * \n \n \n Posidippus also made this epigram on Doricha, although he had often mentioned her\n in his Ethiopia, and this is the epigram\u2014 \n \n Here, Doricha, your bones have long been laid, \n Here is your hair, and your well-scented robe: \n You who once loved the elegant Charaxus, \n And quaff'd with him the morning bowl of wine. \n But Sappho's pages live, and still shall live, \n In which is many a mention of your name, \n Which still your native Naucratis shall cherish, \n As long as any ship sails down the Nile. \n \n \n Archedice also was a native of Naucratis; and she was a courtesan of great beauty.\n For some how or other, as Herodotus says, Naucratis is in\n the habit of producing beautiful courtesans. \n \n ","68":"\n There was also a certain courtesan named Sappho, a native of Eresus, who was in\n love with the beautiful Phaon, and she was very celebrated, as Nymphis relates in\n his Voyage round Asia. But Nicarete of Megara, who was a courtesan, was not a\n woman of ignoble birth, but she was born of free parents, and was very well\n calculated to excite affection by reason of her accomplishments, and she was a\n pupil of Stilpon the philosopher. \n There was also Bilisticha the Argive, who was a very celebrated courtesan, and who\n traced her descent back to the Atrid\u00e6, as those historians relate who have written\n the history of the affairs of Argolis. There was also a courtesan named Le\u00e6na,\n whose name is very celebrated, and she was the mistress of Harmodius, who slew the\n tyrant. And she, being tortured by command of Hippias the tyrant, died under the\n torture without having said a word. Stratocles the orator also had for his\n mistress a courtesan whose name was Leme, \n and who was nicknamed Parorama, because she used to let whoever chose come to her\n for two drachmas, as Gorgias says in his treatise on Courtesans. \n Now though Myrtilus appeared to be intending to say no more after this, he resumed\n his subject, and said:\u2014But I was nearly forgetting, my friends, to tell you of the\n Lyda of Antimachus, and also of her namesake Lyda, who was also a courtesan and\n the mistress of Lamynthius the Milesian. For each of these poets, as Clearchus\n tells us in his Tales of Love, being inflamed with love for the barbarian Lyde,\n wrote poems, the one in elegiac, and the other in lyric\n verse, and they both entitled their poems Lyde. I omitted also to\n mention the female flute-player Nanno, the mistress of Mimnermus, and Leontium,\n the mistress of Hermesianax of Colophon. For he inscribed with her name, as she\n was his mistress, three books of elegiac poetry, in the third of which he gives a\n catalogue of things relating to Love; speaking in the following manner:\u2014 \n ","69":"\n \n \n You know, too, how \u0152ager's much-loved son, \n Skilfully playing on the Thracian harp, \n Brought back from hell his dear Agriope, \n And sail'd across th' inhospitable land \n Where Charon drags down in his common boat \n The souls of all the dead; and far resounds \n The marshy stream slow creeping through the reeds \n That line the death-like banks. But Orpheus dared \n With fearless soul to pass that lonely wave, \n Striking his harp with well-accustom'd hand. \n And with his lay he moved the pitiless gods, \n And various monsters of unfeeling hell. \n He raised a placid smile beneath the brows \n Of grim Cocytus; he subdued the glance \n So pitiless of the fierce, implacable dog, \n Who sharpen'd in the flames his fearful bark, \n Whose eye did glare with fire, and whose heads \n With triple brows struck fear on all who saw. \n He sang, and moved these mighty sovereigns; \n So that Agriope once again did breathe \n The breath of life. Nor did the son of Mene, \n Friend of the Graces, the sweet-voiced Mus\u00e6us, \n Leave his Antiope without due honour, \n Who, amid the virgins sought by many suitors \n In holiest Eleusis' sacred soil, \n Sang the loud joyful song of secret oracles, \n Priestess of Rharian Ceres, warning men. \n And her renown to Pluto's realms extends. \n Nor did these bards alone feel Cupid's sway; \n The ancient bard, leaving B\u0153otia's halls, \n Hesiod, the keeper of all kinds of learning, \n Came to fair Ascra's Heliconian village, \n Where long he sought Eoia's wayward love; \n \n Much he endured, and many books he wrote, \n The maid the inspiring subject of his song. \n And that great poet whom Jove's Fate protects, \n Sweetest of all the votaries of the muse, \n Immortal Homer, sought the rocky isle \n Of Ithaca, moved by love for all the virtue \n And beauty of the chaste Penelope. \n Much for her sake he suffer'd; then he sought \n A barren isle far from his native land, \n And wept the race of Icarus, and of Amyclus \n And Sparta, moved by his own woes' remembrances. \n Who has not heard of sweet Mimnermus' fame; \n Parent of plaintive elegiac verses, \n Which to his lyre in sweetest sounds he sang \n Much did he suffer, burning with the love \n Of cruel Nanno; and full oft inflamed \n With ardent passion, did he feast with her, \n Breathing his love to his melodious pipe; \n And to his hate of fierce Hermobius \n And Pherecles, tuneful utterance he gave. \n Antimachus, too, felt the flame inspired \n By Lydian Lyde; and he sought the stream \n Of golden-waved Pactolus, where he laid \n His lost love underneath the tearless earth, \n And weeping, went his way to Colophon; \n And with his wailing thus sweet volumes fill'd, \n Shunning all toil or other occupation. \n How many festive parties frequent rang \n With the fond love of Lesbian Alc\u00e6us, \n Who sang the praises of the amorous Sappho, \n And grieved his Teian rival, breathing songs \n Such as the nightingale would gladly imitate; \n For the divine Anacreon also sought \n To win the heart of the sacred poetess, \n Chief ornament of all the Lesbian bands; \n And so he roved about, now leaving Samos, \n Now parting from his own enslaved land, \n Parent of vines, to wine-producing Lesbos; \n And often he beheld Cape Lectum there, \n Across th' Aeolian wave. But greatest of all, \n The Attic bee oft\n left its rugged hill, \n Singing in tragic choruses divine, \n Bacchus and Love * * \n * * * * \n I tell, besides, how that too cautious man, \n Who earn'd deserved hate from every woman, \n Stricken by a random shot, did not escape \n Nocturnal pangs of Love; but wander'd o'er \n The Macedonian hills and valleys green, \n \n Smitten with love for fair Argea, who \n Kept Archelaus' house, till the angry god \n Found a fit death for cold Euripides, \n Striving with hungry hounds in vain for life. \n Then there's the man whom, mid Cythera's rocks; \n The Muses rear'd, a faithful worshipper \n Of Bacchus and the flute, Philoxenus: \n Well all men know by what fierce passion moved \n He to this city came; for all have heard \n His praise of Galatea, which he sang \n Amid the sheepfolds. And you likewise know \n The bard to whom the citizens of Cos \n A brazen statue raised to do him honour, \n And who oft sang the praises of his Battis, \n Sitting beneath a plane-tree's shade, Philetas; \n In verses that no time shall e'er destroy. \n Nor do those men whose lot in life is hard, \n Seeking the secret paths of high philosophy, \n Or those whom logic's mazes hold in chains, \n Or that laborious eloquence of words, \n Shun the sharp struggle and sweet strife of Love; \n But willing, follow his triumphant car. \n Long did the charms of fair Theano bind \n The Samian Pythagoras, who laid bare \n The tortuous mysteries of geometry; \n Who all the mazes of the sphere unfolded, \n And knew the laws which regulate the world, \n The atmosphere which doth surround the world, \n And motions of the sun, and moon, and stars. \n Nor did the wisest of all mortal men, \n Great Socrates, escape the fierce contagion, \n But yielded to the fiery might of Venus, \n And to the fascinations of the sex, \n Laying his cares down at Aspasia's feet; \n And though all doubts of nature he could solve, \n He found no refuge from the pursuit of Love. \n Love, too, did draw within the narrow Isthmus \n The Cyrenean sage: and winning Lais, \n With her resistless charms, subdued and bound \n Wise Aristippus, who philosophy. \n Deserted, and preferr'd a trifling life. \n \n \n ","70":"\n But in this Hermesianax is mistaken where he represents Sappho and Anacreon as\n contemporaries. For the one lived in the time of Cyrus and Polycrates; but Sappho\n lived in the reign of Alyattes, the father of Croesus. But Chameleon, in his\n treatise on Sappho, does assert that some people say that these verses were made\n upon her by Anacreon\u2014 \n Love, the golden-haired god, \n Struck me with his purple ball, \n \n And with his many wiles doth seize \n And challenge me to sport with him. \n But she-and she from Lesbos comes, \n That populous and wealthy isle\u2014 \n Laughs at my hair and calls it grey, \n And will prefer a younger lover. \n And he says, too, that Sappho says this to him\u2014 \n You, O my golden-throned muse, \n Did surely dictate that sweet hymn, \n Which the noble Teian bard, \n From the fair and fertile isle, \n Chief muse of lovely womanhood, \n Sang with his dulcet voice. \n \n \n But it is plain enough in reality that this piece of poetry is not Sappho's. And I\n think myself that Hermesianax is joking concerning the love of Anacreon and\n Sappho. For Diphilus the comic poet, in his play called Sappho, has represented\n Archilochus and Hipponax as the lovers of Sappho. \n Now it appears to me, my friends, that I have displayed some diligence in getting\n up this amorous catalogue for you, as I myself am not a person so mad about love\n as Cynulcus, with his calumnious spirit, has represented me. I confess, indeed,\n that I am amorous, but I do deny that I am frantic on the subject. \n And why should I dilate upon my sorrows, \n When I may hide them all in night and silence? \n as Aeschylus the Alexandrian has said in his Amphitryon. And this is the\n same Aeschylus who composed the Messenian poems\u2014a man entirely without any\n education. \n ","71":"\n Therefore I, considering that Love is a mighty and most powerful deity, and that\n the Golden Venus is so too, recollect the verses of Euripides on the subject, and\n say\u2014 \n Dost thou not see how great a deity \n Resistless Venus is? No tongue can tell, \n No calculation can arrive at all \n Her power, or her dominions' vast extent; \n She nourishes you and me and all mankind, \n And I can prove this, not in words alone, \n But facts will show the might of this fair goddess. \n The earth loves rain when the parch'd plains are dry, \n And lose their glad fertility of yield \n From want of moisture. Then the ample heaven, \n When fill'd with rain, and moved by Venus' power, \n Loves to descend to anxious earth's embrace; \n \n Then when these two are join'd in tender love \n They are the parents of all fruits to us, \n They bring them forth, they cherish them; and so \n The race of man both lives and flourishes. \n \n \n And that most magnificent poet Aeschylus, in his Danaides, introduces Venus\n herself speaking thus\u2014 \n Then, too, the earth feels love, and longs for wedlock, \n And rain, descending from the amorous air, \n Impregnates his desiring mate; and she \n Brings forth delicious food for mortal man,\u2014 \n Herds of fat sheep, and corn, the gift of Ceres; \n The trees love moisture, too, and rain descends \n T' indulge their longings, I alone the cause. \n \n \n ","72":"\n And again, in the Hippolytus \n of Euripides, Venus says\u2014 \n And all who dwell to th' eastward of the sea, \n And the Atlantic waves, all who behold \n The beams of the rising and the setting sun, \n Know that I favour those who honour me, \n And crush all those who boast themselves against me. \n \n \n And, therefore, in the case of a young man who had every other imaginable virtue,\n this one fault alone, that he did not honour Venus, was the cause of his\n destruction. And neither Diana, who loved him exceedingly, nor any other of the\n gods or demi-gods could defend him; and accordingly, in the words of the same\n poet,\u2014 \n Whoe'er denies that Love's the only god, \n \n Is foolish, ignorant of all that's true, \n And knows not him who is the greatest deity \n Acknowledged by all nations. \n \n \n And the wise Anacreon, who is in everybody's mouth, is always celebrating love.\n And, accordingly, the admirable Critias also speaks of him in the following\n manner:\u2014 \n Teos brought forth, a source of pride to Greece, \n The sweet Anacreon, who with sweet notes twined \n A wreath of tuneful song in woman's praise, \n The choicest ornament of revelling feasts, \n The most seductive charm; a match for flutes' \n Or pipes' shrill aid, or softly moving lyre: \n O Teian bard, your fame shall never die; \n Age shall not touch it; while the willing slave \n Mingles the wine and water in the bowl, \n \n And fills the welcome goblet for the guests; \n While female bands, with many twinkling feet, \n Lead their glad nightly dance; while many drops, \n Daughters of these glad cups; great Bacchus' juice, \n Fall with good omen on the cottabus dish. \n \n \n ","73":"\n But Archytas the Harmonist, as Cham\u00e6leon calls him, says that Alcman was the\n original poet of amatory songs, and that he was the first poet to introduce\n melodies inciting to lawless indulgence,. . . . being, with respect to women . . .\n . On which account he says in one of his odes\u2014 \n But Love again, so Venus wills, \n Descends into my heart, \n And with his gentle dew refreshes me. \n He says also that he was in a moderate degree in love with Megalostrate,\n who was a poetess, and who was able to allure lovers to her by the charms of her\n conversation. And he speaks thus concerning her\u2014 \n This gift, by the sweet Muse inspired, \n That lovely damsel gave, \n The golden-hair'd Megalostrate. \n \n \n And Stesichorus, who was in no moderate degree given to amorous pursuits, composed\n many poems of this kind; which in ancient times were called \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 and \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. And, in fact,\n there was such emulation about composing poems of this sort, and so far was any\n one from thinking lightly of the amatory poets, that Aeschylus, who was a very\n great poet, and Sophocles, too, introduced the subject of the loves of men on the\n stage in their tragedies: the one describing the love of Achilles for Patroclus,\n and the other, in his Niobe, the mutual love of her sons (on which account some\n men have given an ill name to that tragedy); and all such passages as those are\n very agreeable to the spectators. \n ","74":"\n Ibycus, too, of Rhegium, speaks loudly as follows\u2014 \n In early spring the gold Cydonian apples, \n Water'd by streams from ever-flowing rivers, \n Where the pure garden of the Virgins is, \n And the young grapes, growing beneath the shade \n Of ample branches flourish and increase: \n But Love, who never rests, gives me no shade, \n Nor any recruiting dew; but like the wind, \n Fierce rushing from the north, with rapid fire, \n Urged on by Venus, with its maddening drought \n Burns up my heart, and from my earliest youth, \n Rules o'er my soul with fierce dominion. \n \n And Pindar, who was of an exceedingly amorous disposition,\n says\u2014 \n Oh may it ever be to me to love, \n And to indulge my love, remote from fear; \n And do not thou, my mind, pursue a chase \n Beyond the present number of your years. \n On which account Timon, in his Silli, says\u2014 \n There is a time to love, a time to wed, \n A time to leave off loving; \n and adds that it is not well to wait until some one else shall say, in\n the words of this same philosopher\u2014 \n When this man ought to set ( \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ) he now\n begins \n To follow pleasure ( \u1f21\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n Pindar also mentions Theoxenus of Tenedos, who was much beloved by him;\n and what does he say about him?\u2014 \n And now (for seasonable is the time) \n You ought, my soul, to pluck the flowers of love, \n Which suit your age. \n And he who, looking on the brilliant light that beams \n From the sweet countenance of Theoxenus, \n Is not subdued by love, \n Must have a dark discolour'd heart, \n Of adamant or iron made, \n And harden'd long in the smith's glowing furnace. \n That man is scorn'd by bright-eyed Venus. \n Or else he's poor, and care doth fill his breast; \n Or else beneath some female insolence \n He withers, and so drags on an anxious life: \n But I, like comb of wily bees, \n Melt under Venus's warm rays, \n And waste away while I behold \n The budding graces of the youth I love. \n Surely at Tenedos, persuasion soft, \n And every grace, \n Abides in the lovely son of wise Agesilas. \n \n \n ","75":"\n And many men used to be as fond of having boys for their favourites as women for\n their mistresses. And this was a frequent fashion in many very well regulated\n cities of Greece. Accordingly, the Cretans, as I have said before, and the\n Chalcidians in Eub\u0153a, were very much addicted to the custom of having\n boy-favourites. Therefore Echemens, in his History of Crete, says that it was not\n Jupiter who carried off Ganymede, but Minos. But the before-mentioned Chalcidians\n say that Ganymede was carried off from them by Jupiter; and\n they show the spot, which they call Harpagius; and it is a place which produces extraordinary myrtles. And Minos\n abandoned his enmity to the Athenians, (although it had originated in consequence\n of the death of his son, out of his love for Theseus: and he gave his daughter\n Ph\u00e6dra to him for his wife,) as Zenis, or Zeneus, the Chian, tells us in his\n treatise on Country. \n ","76":"\n But Hieronymus the Peripatetic says that the ancients were anxious to encourage\n the practice of having boy-favourites, because the vigorous disposition of youths,\n and the confidence engendered by their association with each other, has often led\n to the overthrow of tyrannies. For in the presence of his favourite, a man would\n choose to do anything rather than to get the character of a coward. And this was\n proved in practice in the case of the Sacred Band, as it was called, which was\n established at Thebes by Epaminondas. And the death of the Pisistratid\u00e6 was\n brought about by Harmodius and Aristogiton; and at Agrigentum in Sicily, the\n mutual love of Chariton and Melanippus produced a similar result, as we are told\n by Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Amatory Matters. For Melanippus and\n Chariton, being informed against as plotting against Phalaris, and being put to\n the torture in order to compel them to reveal their accomplices, not only did not\n betray them, but even made Phalaris himself pity them, on account of the tortures\n which they had undergone, so that he dismissed them with great praise. On which\n account Apollo, being pleased at this conduct, gave Phalaris a respite from death;\n declaring this to the men who consulted the Pythian priestess as to how they might\n best attack him. He also gave them an oracle respecting Chariton, putting the\n Pentameter before the Hexameter, in the same way as afterwards Dionysius the\n Athenian did, who was nicknamed the Brazen, in his Elegies; and the oracle runs as\n follows\u2014 \n Happy were Chariton and Melanippus, \n Authors of heavenly love to many men. \n \n \n The circumstances, too, that happened to Cratinus the Athenian, are very\n notorious. For he, being a very beautiful boy, at the time when Epimenides was\n purifying Attica by human sacrifices, on account of some old pollution, as\n Neanthes of Cyzicus relates in the second book of his treatise on Sacrifices, willingly gave himself up to secure the safety of\n the woman who had brought him up. And after his death, Apollodorus, his friend,\n also devoted himself to death, and so the calamities of the country were\n terminated. Ad owing to favouritism of this kind, the tyrants (for friendships of\n this sort were very adverse to their interests) altogether forbad the fashion of\n making favourites of boys, and wholly abolished it. And some of them even burnt\n down and rased to the ground the pal\u00e6str\u00e6, considering them as fortresses hostile\n to their own citadels; as, for instance, Polycrates the tyrant of Samos did. \n ","77":"\n But among the Spartans, as Agnon the Academic philosopher tells us, girls and boys\n are all treated in the same way before marriage: for the great lawgiver Solon has\n said\u2014 \n Admiring pretty legs and rosy lips;\u2014 \n as Aeschylus and Sophocles have openly made similar statements; the one\n saying, in the Myrmidons\u2014 \n You paid not due respect to modesty, \n Led by your passion for too frequent kisses;\u2014 \n and the other, in his Colchian Women, speaking of Ganymede, says\u2014 \n Inflaming with his beauty mighty Jove. \n \n \n But I am not ignorant that the stories which are told about Cratinus and\n Aristodemus are stated by Polemo Periegetes, in his Replies to Neanthes, to be all\n mere inventions. But you, O Cynulcus, believe that all these stories are true, let\n them be ever so false. And you take the greatest pleasure in all such poems as\n turn on boys and favourite; of that kind; while the fashion of making favourites\n of boys was first introduced among the Grecians from Crete, as Tim\u00e6us informs us.\n But others say that Laius was the originator of this custom, when he was received\n in hospitality by Pelops; and that he took a great fancy to his son, Chrysipps,\n whom he put into his chariot and carried off, and fled with to Thebes. But\n Praxilla the Sicyonian says that Chrysippus was carried off by Jupiter. And the\n Celt\u00e6, too, although they have the most beautiful women of all the barbarians,\n still make great favourites of boys . . . . . And the Persians, according to the\n statement of Herodotus, learnt from the Greeks to adopt this fashion. \n ","78":"\n Alexander the king was also very much in the habit of giving\n in to this fashion. Accordingly, Dic\u00e6archus, in his treatise on the Sacrifice at\n Troy, says that he was so much under the influence of Bagoas the eunuch, that he\n embraced him in the sight of the whole theatre; and that when the whole theatre\n shouted in approval of the action, he repeated it. And Carystius, in his Historic\n Commentaries, says,\u2014 Charon the Chalcidian had a boy of great beauty, who\n was a great favourite of his: but when Alexander, on one occasion, at a great\n entertainment given by Craterus, praised this boy very much, Charon bade the\n boy go and salute Alexander: and he said, 'Not so, for he will not please me so\n much as he will vex you.' For though the king was of a very amorous\n disposition, still he was at all times sufficiently master of himself to have a\n due regard to decorum, and to the preservation of appearances. And in the same\n spirit, when he had taken as prisoners the daughters of Darius, and his wife,\n who was of extraordinary beauty, he not only abstained from offering them any\n insult, but he took care never to let them feel that they were prisoners at\n all; but ordered them to be treated in every respect, and to be supplied with\n everything, just as if Darius had still been in his palace; on which account,\n Darius, when he heard of this conduct, raised his hands to the Sun and prayed\n that either he might be king, or Alexander. \n \n But Ibycus states that Talus was a great favourite of Rhadamanthus the Just. And\n Diotimus, in his Heraclea, says that Eurystheus was a great favourite of Hercules,\n on which account he willingly endured all his labours for his sake. And it is said\n that Argynnus was a favourite of Agamemnon; and that they first became acquainted\n from Agamemnon seeing Argynnus bathing in the Cephisus. And afterwards, when he\n was drowned in this river, (for he was continually bathing in it,) Agamemnon\n buried him, and raised a temple on the spot to Venus Argynnis. But Licymnius of\n Chios, in his Dithyrambics, says that it was Hymen\u00e6us of whom Argynnus was a\n favourite. And Aristocles the harp-player was a favourite of King Antigonus: and\n Antigonus the Carystian, in his Life of Zeno, writes of him in the following\n terms: \u2014 Antigonus the king used often to go to sup with Zeno; and once, as\n he was returning by daylight from some entertainment, he went to Zeno's house,\n and persuaded him to go with him to sup with Aristocles\n the harp-player, who was an excessive favourite of the king's. \n \n ","79":"\n Sophocles, too, had a great fancy for hating boy-favourites, equal to the\n addiction of Euripides for women. And accordingly, Ion the poet, in his book on\n the Arrival of Illustrious Men in the Island of Chios, writes thus:\u2014\"I met\n Sophocles the poet in Chios, when he was sailing to Lesbos as the general: he was\n a man very pleasant over his wine, and very witty. And when Hermesilaus, who was\n connected with him by ancient ties of hospitality, and who was also the\n proxenus of the Athenians, entertained him, the boy who was mixing the wine was\n standing by the fire, being a boy of a very beautiful complexion, but made red by\n the fire: so Sophocles called him and said, 'Do you wish me to drink with\n pleasure? and when he said that he did, he said, 'Well, then, bring me the cup,\n and take it away again in a leisurely manner.' And as the boy blushed all the more\n at this, Sophocles said to the guest who was sitting next to him, 'How well did\n Phrynichus speak when he said\u2014 \n The light of love doth shine in purple cheeks. \n And a man from Eretria, or from Erythr\u00e6, who was a school\u2014 master, answered him,\u2014' You are a great man in poetry, O\n Sophocles; but still Phrynichus did not say well when he called purple cheeks a\n mark of beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with purple\n paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to compare what is\n beautiful with what is not so.' And on this Sophocles, laughing at the Eretrian,\n said,\u2014' Then, my friend, I suppose you are not pleased with the line in Simonides\n which is generally considered among the Greeks to be a beautiful one\u2014 \n \n \n The maid pour'd forth a gentle voice \n From out her purple mouth. \n \n Pindar, Ol. vi. 71. \n \n And you do not either like the poet who spoke of the golden-haired'\n Apollo; for if a painter were to represent the hair of the god as actually golden,\n and not black, the picture would be all the worse. Nor do you approve of the poet\n who spoke of rosy-fingered. For if\n any one were to dip his fingers in rosy-coloured paint he would make his hands\n like those of a purple-dyer, and not of a pretty woman.' And when they all laughed\n at this, the Eretrian was checked by the reproof; and Sophocles again turned to\n pursue the conversation with the boy; for he asked him, as he was brushing away\n the straws from the cup with his little finger, whether he saw any straws: and\n when he said that he did, he said, 'Blow them away, then, that you may not dirty\n your fingers.' And when he brought his face near the cup he held the cup nearer to\n his own mouth, so as to bring his own head nearer to the head of the boy. And when\n he was very near he took him by the hand and kissed him. And when all clapped\n their hands, laughing and shouting out, to see how well he had taken the boy in,\n he said, ' I, my friends, am meditating on the art of generalship, since Pericles\n has said that I know how to compose poetry, but not how to be a general; now has\n not this stratagem of mine succeeded perfectly?' And he both said and did many\n things of this kind in a witty manner, drinking and giving himself up to mirth:\n but as to political affairs he was not able nor energetic in them, but behaved as\n any other virtuous Athenian might have done. \n \n ","80":"\n And Hieronymus of Rhodes, in his Historic Commen- taries, says that Sophocles was\n not always so moderate, but that he at times committed grater excesses, and gave\n Euripides a handle to reproach him, as bringing himself into disrepute by his\n excessive intemperance. \n ","81":"\n And Theopompus, in his treatise on the Treasures of which the Temple at Delphi was\n plundered, says that Asopichus, being a favourite of Epaminondas, had the\n trophy of Leuctra represented in relief on his shield, and that he encountered\n danger with extraordinary gallantry; and that this shield is consecrated at\n Delphi, in the portico. And in the same treatise, Theopompus further\n alleges that Phayllus, the tyrant of Phocis, was extremely addicted to\n women; but that Onomarchus used to select boys as his favourites: and that he\n had a favourite, the son of Pythodorus the Sicyonian, to whom, when he came to\n Delphi to devote his hair to the god (and he was a youth of great beauty),\n Onomarchus gave the offerings of the Sybarites-four golden combs. And Phayllus\n gave to the daughter of Diniades, who was a female flute-player, a\n Bromiadian, a silver goblet of the\n Phoc\u00e6ans, and a golden crown of ivy-leaves, the offering of the Peparethians.\n And, he says, \"she was about to play the flute at the Pythian games, if\n she had not been hindered by the populace. \n \n Onomarchus also gave, as he says, \"to his favourite Lycolas, and to\n Physcidas the son of Tricholaus (who was very handsome), a crown of laurel, the\n offering of the Ephesians. This boy was brought also to Philip by his father, but\n was dismissed without any favour. Onomarchus also gave to Damippus, the son of\n Epilycus of Amphipolis, who was a youth of great beauty, a present which had been\n consecrated to the god by Plisthenes. \n \n And Philomelus gave to Pharsalia, a dancing-woman from Thessaly, a golden\n crown of laurel-leaves, which had been offered by the Lampsacenes. But\n Pharsalia herself was afterwards torn to pieces at Metapontum, by the\n soothsayers, in the market-place, on the occasion of a voice coming forth out\n of the brazen laurel which the people of Metapontum had set up at the time when\n Aristeas of Proconnesus was sojourning among them, on his return, as he stated,\n from the Hyperboreans, the first moment that she was seen\n entering the market-place. And when men afterwards inquired into the reason for\n this violence, she was found to have been put to death on account of this crown\n which belonged to the god. \n \n ","82":"\n Now I warn you, O philosophers, who indulge in unnatural passions, and who treat\n the great goddess Venus with impiety, to beware, lest you be destroyed in the same\n manner. For boys are only handsome, as Glycera the courtesan said, while they are\n like women: at least, this is the saying attributed to her by Clearchus. But my\n opinion is that the conduct of Cleonymus the Spartan was in strict conformity with\n nature, who was the first man to take such hostages as he took from the\n Metapontines\u2014namely, two hundred of their most respectable and beautiful virgins;\n as is related by Duris the Samian, in the third book of his History of Agathocles.\n And I too, as is said by Epicrates in his Antilais, \n Have learnt by heart completely all the songs \n Breathing of love which sweetest Sappho sang, \n Or the Lamynthian Cleomenes. \n But you, my philosophical friends, even when you are in love with women .\n . . . . . . . . . . . . as Clearchus says. For a bull was excited by the sight of\n the brazen cow at Pirene: and in a picture that existed of a bitch, and a pigeon,\n and a goose; and a gander came up to the goose, and a dog to the bitch, and a male\n pigeon to the pigeon, and not one of them discovered the deception till they got\n close to them; but when they got near enough to touch them, they desisted; just as\n Clisophus the Salymbrian did. For he fell in love with a statue of Parian marble\n that then was at Samos, and shut himself up in the temple to gratify his\n affection; but when he found that he could make no impression on the coldness and\n unimpressibility of the stone, then he discarded his passion. And Alexis the poet\n mentions this circumstance in his drama entitled The Picture, where he says\u2014\n \n And such another circumstance, they say, \n Took place in Samos: there a man did fall \n In love with a fair maiden wrought in marble, \n And shut himself up with her in the temple. \n And Philemon mentions the same fact, and says\u2014 \n But once a man, 'tis said, did fall, at Samos, \n In love with a marble woman; and he went \n And shut himself up with her in the temple. \n \n But the statue spoken of is the work of Ctesicles; as Ad\u00e6us\n of Mitylene tells us in his treatise on Statuaries. And Polemo, or whoever the\n author of the book called Helladicus is, says\u2014\"At Delphi, in the museum of the\n pictures, there are two boys wrought in marble; one of which, the Delphians say,\n was so fallen in love with by some one who came to see it, that he made love to\n it, and shut himself up with it, and presented it with a crown; but when he was\n detected, the god ordered the Delphians, who consulted his oracle with reference\n to the subject, to dismiss him freely, for that he had given him a handsome\n reward. \n ","83":"\n And even brute beasts have fallen in love with men: for there was a cock who took\n a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus, a cupbearer of the king; and the cock\n was nicknamed the Centaur. But this Secundus was a slave of Nicomedes the king of\n Bithynia; as Nicander informs us in the sixth book of his essay on the Revolutions\n of Fortune. And, at Egium, a goose took a fancy to a boy; as Clearchus relates in\n the first book of his Amatory Anecdotes. And Theophrastus, in his essay on Love,\n says that the name of this boy was Amphilochus, and that he was a native of\n Olenus. And Hermeas the son of Hermodorus, who was a Samian by birth, says that a\n goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the philosopher. And in Leucadia according to a\n story told by Clearchus), a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there, that when\n she died, the bird died top. There is a story also that, at Iasus, a dolphin took\n a fancy to a boy (and this story is told by Duris, in the ninth book of his\n History); and the subject of that book is the history of Alexander, and the\n historian's words are these: \"He likewise sent for the boy from Iasus. For near\n Iasus there was a boy whose name was Dionysius, and he once, when leaving the\n pal\u00e6stra with the rest of the boys, went down to the sea and bathed; and a dolphin\n came forward out of the deep water to meet him, and taking him on his back, swam\n sway with him a considerable distance into the open sea, and then brought him back\n again to land.\" But the dolphin is an animal which is very fond of men, and very\n intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude. Accordingly Phylarchus, in his\n twelfth book, says\u2014 Coiranus the Milesian, when he saw some fishermen who\n had caught a dolphin in a net, and who were about to cut\n it up, gave them some money and bought the fish, and took it down and put it\n back in the sea again. And after this it happened to him to be shipwrecked near\n Myconos, and while every one else perished, Coiranus alone was saved by a\n dolphin. And when, at last, he died of old age in his native country, as it so\n happened that his funeral procession passed along the sea-shore close to\n Miletus, a great shoal of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbour, keeping\n only a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of\n Coiranus, as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their\n grief. \n \n The same Phylarchus also relates, in the twentieth book of his History, the great\n affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy. And his words are\n these: But there was a female elephant kept with this elephant, and the\n name of the female elephant was Nic\u00e6a; and to her the wife of the king of\n India, when dying, entrusted her child, which was just a month old. And when\n the woman did die, the affection for the child displayed by the beast, was most\n extraordinary; for it could not endure the child to be away; and whenever it\n did not see him, it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the\n infant with milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast;\n and if she had not done so, the elephant would not take any food; and after\n this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near, and, while the\n child was sleeping, beat away the flies with the bundle. And whenever the child\n wept, it would rock the cradle with its trunk, and lull it to sleep. And very\n often the male elephant did the same. \n \n ","84":"\n But you, O philosophers, are far fiercer than dolphins and elephants, and are also\n much more untameable; although Pers\u00e6us the Citti\u00e6an, in his Recollections of\n Banquets, says loudly,\u2014\u201cIt is a very consistent subject of conversation at\n drinking-parties for men to talk of amatory matters; for we are naturally inclined\n to such topics after drinking. And at those times we should praise those who\n indulge in that kind of conversation to a moderate and temperate degree, but blame\n those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner. But if logicians,\n when assembled in a social party, were to talk about syllogisms, then a man might\n very fairly think that they were acting very unseasonably. And a respectable and virtuous man will at times get drunk; but they\n who wish to appear extraordinarily temperate, keep up this character amid their\n cups for a certain time, but afterwards, as the wine begins to take effect on\n them, they descend to every kind of impropriety and indecency. And this was the\n case very lately with the ambassadors who came to Antigonus from Arcadia; for they\n sat at dinner with great severity of countenance, and with great propriety, as\n they thought,- not only not looking at any one of us, but not even looking at one\n another. But as the wine went round, and music of different kinds was introduced,\n and when the Thessalian dancing-women, as their fashion is, came in, and danced\n quite naked, except that they had girdles round their waists, then the men could\n not restrain themselves any longer, but jumped up off the couches, and shouted as\n if they were beholding a most gratifying sight; and they congratulated the king\n because he had it in his power to indulge in such pastimes; and they did and said\n a great many more vulgar things of the same kind. \n \"And one of the philosophers who was once drinking with us, when a flute-playing\n girl came in, and when there was plenty of room near him, when the girl wished to\n sit down near him, would not allow her, but drew himself up and looked grave. And\n then afterwards, when the girl was put up to auction, as is often the fashion at\n such entertainments, he was exceedingly eager to buy her, and quarrelled with the\n man who sold her, on the ground that he had knocked her down too speedily to some\n one else; and he said that the auctioneer had not fairly sold her. And at last his\n grave philosopher, he who at first would not permit the girl even to sit near him,\n came to blows about her.\" And perhaps this very philosopher, who came to blows\n about the flute-playing girl, may have been Pers\u00e6us himself; for Antinus the\n Carystian, in his treatise on Zeno, makes the following statement:\u2014 Zeno the\n Citti\u00e6an, when once Pers\u00e6us and a drinking-party bought a flute-playing girl,\n and after that was afraid to bring her home, because he lived in the same house\n with Zeno, becoming acquainted with the circumstance, brought the girl home\n himself, and shut her up with Pers\u00e6us. I know, also, that Polystratus\n the Athenian, who was a pupil of Theophrastus, and who was surnamed the Tyrrhenian, used often to put on the garments of the female\n flute-players. \n ","85":"\n Kings, too, have shown great anxiety about musical women; as Parmenion tells us\n in his Letter to Alexander, which he sent to that monarch after he had taken\n Damascus, and after he had become master of all the baggage of Darius.\n Accordingly, having enumerated all the things which he had taken, he writes as\n follows:\u2014 I found three hundred and twenty-nine concubines of the king,\n all skilled in music; and forty-six men who were skilful in making garlands,\n and two hundred and seventy-seven confectioners, and twenty-nine boilers of\n pots, and thirteen cooks skilful in pre- paring milk, and seventeen artists who\n mixed drinks, and seventy slaves who strain wine, and forty preparers of\n perfumes. And I say to you, O my companions, that there is no sight\n which has a greater tendency to gladden the eyes than the beauty of a woman.\n Accordingly \u0152neus, in the play of Ch\u00e6remon the tragedian, speaking of some maidens\n whom he had seen, says, in the play called \u0152neus,\u2014 \n And one did lie with garment well thrown back, \n Showing her snow-white bosom to the moon: \n Another, as she lightly danced, display'd \n The fair proportions of her lefthand side, \n Naked-a lovely picture for the air \n To wanton with; and her complexion white \n Strove with the darkening shades. Another bared \n Her lovely arms and taper fingers all: \n Another, with her robe high round her neck, \n Conceal'd her bosom, but a rent below \n Show'd all her shapely thighs. The Graces smiled, \n And love, not without hope, did lead me on. \n Then on th' inviting asphodel they fell, \n Plucking the dark leaves of the violet flower, \n And crocus, which, with purple petals rising, \n Copies the golden rays of the early sun. \n There, too, the Persian sweetly-smelling marjoram \n Stretch'd out its neck along the laughing meadow. \n \n \n ","86":"\n And the same poet, being passionately fond of flowers, says also in his\n Alphesibcea\u2014 \n The glorious beauty of her dazzling body \n Shone brilliant, a sweet sight to every eye; \n And modesty, a tender blush exciting, \n Tinted her gentle cheeks with delicate rose: \n Her waxy hair, in gracefully modell'd curls, \n Falling as though arranged by sculptor's hand, \n Waved in the wanton breeze luxuriant. \n \n And in his Io he calls the flowers children of spring, where\n he says\u2014 \n Strewing around sweet children of the spring. \n And in his Centaur, which is a drama composed in many metres of various\n kinds, he calls them children of the meadow\u2014 \n There, too, they did invade the countless host \n Of all the new-born flowers that deck the fields, \n Hunting with joy the offspring of the meadows. \n And in his Bacchus he says\u2014 \n The ivy, lover of the dance, \n Child of the mirthful year. \n And in his Ulysses he speaks thus of roses:\u2014 \n And in their hair the Hours' choicest gifts \n They wore, the flowering, fragrant rose, \n The loveliest foster-child of spring. \n And in his Thyestes he says\u2014 \n The brilliant rose, and modest snow-white lily. \n And in his Miny\u00e6 he says\u2014 \n There was full many a store of Venus to view, \n Dark in the rich flowers in due season ripe. \n \n \n ","87":"\n Now there have been many women celebrated for their beauty (for, as Euripides\n says\u2014 \n E'en an old bard may sing of memory) \n There was, for instance, Thargelia the Milesian, who was married to\n fourteen different husbands, so very beautiful and accomplished was she, as\n Hippias the Sophist says, in his book which is entitled Synagoge. But Dinon, in\n the fifth book of his History of Persia, and in the first part of it, says that\n the wife of Bagazus, who was a sister of Xerxes by the same father, (and her name\n was Anytis,) was the most beautiful and the most licentious of all the woman in\n Asia. And Phylarchus, in his nineteenth book, says that Timosa, the concubine of\n Oxyartes, surpassed all women in beauty, and that the king of Egypt had originally\n sent her as a present to Statira, the wife of the king. \n And Theopompus, in the fifty-sixth book of his History, speaks of Xenopithea, the\n mother of Lysandrides, as the most beautiful of all the women in Peloponnesus. And\n the Laced\u00e6monians put her to death, and her sister Chryse also, when Agesilaus the\n king, having raised a seditious tumult in the city, procured Lysandrides, who was\n his enemy, to be banished by the Laced\u00e6monians. Pantica of Cyprus was also a very beautiful woman; and she is mentioned by\n Phylarchus, in the tenth book of his History, where he says that when she was with\n Olympias, the mother of Alexander, Monimus, the son of Pythion, asked her in\n marriage. And, as she was a very licentious woman, Olympias said to him\u2014 O\n wretched man, you are marrying with your eyes, and not with your\n understanding. They also say that the woman who brought back\n Pisistratus to assume the tyranny, clad in the semblance of Minerva the Saviour,\n was very beautiful, as indeed she ought to have been, seeing that she assumed the\n appearance of a goddess. And she was a seller of garlands; and Pisistratus\n afterwards gave her in marriage to Hipparchus his son, as Clidemus relates in the\n eighth book of his Returns, where he says\u2014- And he also gave the woman, by\n name Phya, who had been in the chariot with him, in marriage to his son\n Hipparchus. And she was the daughter of a man named Socrates. And he took for\n Hippias, who succeeded him in the tyranny, the daughter of Charmus the\n polemarch, who was extraordinarily beautiful. \n \n And it happened, as it is said, that Charmus was a great admirer of Hippias, and\n that he was the man who first erected a statue of Love in the Academy, on which\n there is the following inscription\u2014 \n O wily Love, Charmus this altar raised \n At the well-shaded bounds of her Gymnasium. \n Hesiod, also, in the third book of his Melampodia, calls Chalcis in\n Eub\u0153a, \n Land of fair women;\u2014 \n for the women there are very beautiful, as Theophrastus also asserts. And\n Nymphodorus, in his Voyage round Asia, says that there are nowhere more beautiful\n women than those in Tenedos, an island close to Troy. \n ","88":"\n I am aware, too, that on one occasion there was a contest of beauty instituted\n among women. And Nicias, speaking of it in his History of Arcadia, says that\n Cypselus instituted it, having built a city in the plain which is watered by the\n Alpheus; in which he established some Parrhasians, and consecrated a plot of\n sacred ground and an altar to Ceres of Eleusis, in whose festival it was that he\n had instituted this contest of beauty. And he says that the woman who gained the\n victory in this contest was Herodice. And even to this day\n this contest is continued; and the women who contend in it are called Goldbearing.\n And Theophrastus says that there is also a contest of beauty which takes place\n among the Eleans, and that the decision is come to with great care and\n deliberation; and that those who gain the victory receive arms as their prize,\n which Dionysius of Leuctra says are offered up to Minerva. And he says, too, that\n the victor is adorned with fillets by his friends, and goes in procession to the\n temple; and that a crown of myrtle is given to him (at least this is the statement\n of Myrsilus, in his Historical Paradoxes). But in some places, says\n the same Theophrastus, there are contests between the women in respect of\n modesty and good management, as there are among the barbarians; and at other\n places also there are contests about beauty, on the ground that this also is\n entitled to honour, as for instance, there are in Tenedos and Lesbos. But they\n say that this is the gift of chance, or of nature; but that the honour paid to\n modesty ought to be one of a greater degree. For that it is in consequence of\n modesty that beauty is beautiful; for without modesty it is apt to be subdued\n by intemperance. \n \n ","89":"\n Now, when Myrtilus had said all this in a connected statement; and when all were\n marvelling at his memory, Cynulcus said\u2014 \n Your multifarious learning I do wonder at\u2014 \n Though there is not a thing more vain and useless, \n says Hippon the Atheist. But the divine Heraclitus also says\u2014 A\n great variety of information does not usually give wisdom. And Timon\n said\u2014 \n There is great ostentation and parade \n Of multifarious learning, than which nothing \n Can be more vain or useless. \n For what is the use of so many names, my good grammarian, which are more\n calculated to overwhelm the hearers than to do them any good? And if any one were\n to inquire of you, who they were who were shut up in the wooden horse, you would\n perhaps be able to tell the names of one or two; and even this you would not do\n out of the verses of Stesichorus, (for that could hardly be,) but out of the\n Storming of Troy, by Sacadas the Argive; for he has given a catalogue of a great\n number of names. Nor indeed could you properly give a list of\n the companions of Ulysses, and say who they were who were devoured by the Cyclops,\n or by the L\u00e6strygonians, and whether they were really devoured or not. And you do\n not even know this, in spite of your frequent mention of Phylarchus, that in the\n cities of the Ceans it is not possible to see either courtesans or female\n flute-players. And Myrtilus said,\u2014But where has Phylarchus stated this For I have\n read through all his history. And when he said,\u2014In the twenty-third book; Myrtilus\n said\u2014 \n ","90":"\n Do I not then deservedly detest all you philosophers, since you are all haters of\n philology,\u2014men whom not only did Lysimachus the king banish from his own\n dominions, as Carystius tells us in his Historic Reminiscenses, but the Athenians\n did so too. At all events, Alexis, in his Horse, says\u2014 \n Is this the Academy; is this Xenocrates? \n May the gods greatly bless Demetrius \n And all the lawgivers; for, as men say, \n They've driven out of Attica with disgrace \n All those who do profess to teach the youth \n Learning and science. \n And a certain man named Sophocles, passed a decree to banish all the\n philosophers from Attica. And Philo, the friend of Aristotle, wrote an oration\n against him; and Demochares, on the other hand, who was the cousin of Demosthenes,\n composed a defence for Sophocles. And the Romans, who are in every respect the\n best of men, banished all the sophists from Rome, on the ground of their\n corrupting the youth of the city, though, at a subsequent time, somehow or other,\n they admitted them. And Anaxippus the comic poet declares your folly in his Man\n struck by Lightning, speaking thus\u2014 \n Alas, you're a philosopher; but I \n Do think philosophers are only wise \n In quibbling about words; in deeds they are, \n As far as I can see, completely foolish. \n \n \n It is, therefore, with good reason that many cities, and especially the city of\n the Laced\u00e6monians, as Cham\u00e6leon says in his book on Simonides, will not admit\n either rhetoric or philosophy, on account of the jealousy, and strife, and\n profitless discussions to which they give rise; owing to which it was that,\n Socrates was put to death; he, who argued against the judges\n who were given him by lot, discoursing of justice to them when they were a pack of\n most corrupt men. And it is owing to this, too, that Theodorus the Atheist was put\n to death, and that Diagoras was banished; and this latter, sailing away when he\n was banished, was wrecked. But Theotimus, who wrote the books against Epicurus,\n was accused by Zeno the Epicurean, and put to death; as is related by Demetrius\n the Magnesian, in his treatise in People and Things which go by the same Name. \n ","91":"\n And, in short, according to Clearchus the Solensian, you do not adopt a manly\n system of life, but you do really aim at a system which might become a dog; but\n although this animal has four excellent qualities, you select none but the worst\n of his qualities for your imitation. For a dog is a wonderful animal as to his\n power of smelling and of distinguishing what belongs to his own family and what\n does not; and the way in which he associates with man and the manner in which he\n watches over and protects the houses of all those who are kind to him, is\n extraordinary. But you who imitate the dogs, do neither of these things. For you\n do not associate with men, nor do you distinguish, between those with whom you are\n acquainted; and being very deficient in sensibility, you live in an indolent and\n indifferent manner. But while the dog is also a snarling and greedy animal, and\n also hard in his way of living, and naked; these habits of his you practise, being\n abusive and gluttonous, and, besides all this, living without a home or a hearth.\n The result of all which circumstances is, that you are destitute of virtue, and\n quite unserviceable for any useful purpose in life. For there is nothing less\n philosophical than those persons who are called philosophers. For whoever supposed\n that Aeschines, the pupil of Socrates, would have been such a man in his manners\n as Lysias the orator, in his speeches on the Contracts, represents him to have\n been; when, out of the dialogues which are extant, and generally represented to be\n his work, we are inclined to admire him as an equitable and moderate man? unless,\n indeed, those writings are in reality the work of the wise Socrates, and were\n given to Aeschines by Xanthippe, the wife of Socrates, after his death, which\n Idomeneus asserts to be the case. \n ","92":"\n But Lysias, in the oration which bears this title\u2014 \n Against Aeschines, the Pupil of Socrates, for Debt, (for I will\n recite the passage, even though it be a rather long one, on account of your\n excessive arrogance, O philosophers,)\u2014 begins in the following manner\u2014 I\n never should have imagined, O judges, that Aeschines would have dared to come\n into court on a trial which is so discreditable to him. For a more\n disgracefully false accusation than the one which he has brought forward, I do\n not believe it to be easy to find. For he, O judges, owing a sum of money with\n a covenanted interest of three drachm\u00e6 to Sosinomus the banker and Aristogiton,\n came to me, and besought me not to allow him to be wholly stripped of his own\n property, in consequence of this high interest. ' And I,' said he, am at this\n moment carrying on the trade of a perfumer; but I want capital to go on with,\n and I will pay you nine obols a month interest. A fine end\n to the happiness of this philosopher was the trade of a perfumer, and admirably\n harmonizing with the philosophy of Socrates, a man who utterly rejected the use of\n all perfumes and unguents! And moreover, Solon the lawgiver expressly forbade a\n man to devote himself to any such business: on which account Pherecrates, in his\n Oven, or Woman sitting up all Night, says\u2014 \n Why should he practise a perfumer's trade, \n Sitting beneath a high umbrella there, \n Preparing for himself a seat on which \n To gossip with the youths the whole day long? \n And presently afterwards he says\u2014 \n And no one ever saw a female cook \n Or any fishwoman; for every class \n Should practise arts which are best suited to it. \n And after what I have already quoted, the orator proceeds to\n say\u2014 And I was persuaded by this speech of his, considering also that\n this Aeschines had been the pupil of Socrates, and was a man who uttered fine\n sentiments about virtue and justice, and who would never\n attempt nor venture on the actions practised by dishonest and unjust\n men. \n \n ","93":"\n And after this again, after he had run through the accusation of Aeschines, and\n had explained how he had bor- rowed the money, and how he never paid either\n interest or principal, and how, when an action was brought against him, he had\n allowed judgment to go by default, and how a branded slave of his had been put\n forward by him as security; and after he had brought a good many more charges of\n the same kind against him, he thus proceeded:\u2014\u201cBut, O judges, I am not the only\n person to whom he behaves in this manner, but he treats every one who has any\n dealings with him in the same manner. Are not even all the wine-sellers who live\n near him, from whom he gets wine for his entertainments and never pays for it,\n bringing actions against him, having already closed their shops against him? And\n his neighbours are ill- treated by him to such a degree that they leave their own\n houses, and go and rent others which are at a distance from him. And with respect\n to all the contributions which he collects, he never himself puts down the\n remaining share which is due from him, but all the money which ever gets into this\n pedlar's hands is lost as if it were utterly destroyed. And such a number of men\n come to his house daily at dawn, to ask for their money which he owes them, that\n passers-by suppose he must be dead, and that such a crowd can only be collected to\n attend his funeral. \n \n And those men who live in the Pir\u00e6us have such an opi- nion of him, that\n they think it a far less perilous business to sail to the Adriatic than to deal\n with him; for he thinks that all that he can borrow is much more actually his\n own thin what his father left him. Has he not got possession of the property of\n Herm\u00e6us the perfumer, after having seduced his wife, though she was seventy\n years old? whom he pretended to be in love with, and then treated in such a\n manner that she reduced her husband and her sons to beggary, and made him a\n per- fumer instead of a pedlar! in so amorous a manner did he handle the\n damsel, enjoying the fruit of her youth, when it would have been less trouble\n to him to count her teeth than the fingers of her hand, they were so much fewer\n And now come forward, you witnesses, who will prove these facts. \u2014This, then,\n is the life of this sophist. \n \n \n These, O Cynulcus, are the words of Lysias. But I, in the words of Aristarchus the\n tragic poet, \n Saying no more, but this in self-defence, \n will now cease my attack upon you and the rest of the Cynics. \n "},"13":{"0":"\n MOST people, my friend Timocrates, call Bacchus frantic, because those who drink\n too much unmixed wine become violent \n \n \n To copious wine this insolence we owe, \n And much thy betters wine can overthrow \n The great Eurytion, when this frenzy stung, \n Pirithous' roofs with frantic riot rung: \n Boundless the Centaur raged, till one and all \n The heroes rose and dragg'd him from the hall; \n His nose they shorten'd, and his ears they slit, \n And sent him sober'd home with better wit. \n \n Odyss. xxi. 293. \n \n For when the wine has penetrated down into the body, as Herodotus says,\n bad and furious language is apt to rise to the surface. And Clearchus the comic\n poet says in his Corinthians\u2014 \n If all the men who to get drunk are apt, \n Had every day a headache ere they drank \n The wine, there is not one would drink a drop: \n But as we now get all the pleasure first, \n And then the drink, we lose the whole delight \n In the sharp pain which follows. \n \n \n And Xenophon represents Agesilaus as insisting that a man ought to shun\n drunkenness equally with madness, and immoderate gluttony as much as idleness. But\n we, as we are not of the class who drink to excess, nor of the number of those who\n are in the habit of being intoxicated by midday, have come rather to this literary\n entertainment; for Ulpian, who is always finding fault, reproved some one just now\n who said, I am not drunk ( \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ), saying,\u2014Where\n do you find that word \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ? But he\n rejoined,\u2014Why, in Alexis, who, in his play called the New Settler, says\u2014 \n He did all this when drunk ( \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n \n \n \n ","1":"\n But as, after the discussion by us of the new topics which arise, our liberal\n entertainer Laurentius is every day constantly introducing different kinds of\n music, and also jesters and buffoons, let us have a little talk about them.\n Although I am aware that Anacharsis the Scythian, when on one occasion jesters\n were introduced in his company, remained without moving a muscle of his\n countenance; but afterwards, when a monkey was brought in, he burst out laughing,\n and said, Now this fellow is laughable by his nature, but man is only so\n through practice. And Euripides, in his Melanippe in Chains, has said\u2014\n \n But many men, from the wish to raise a laugh, \n Practise sharp sayings; but those sorry jesters \n I hate who let loose their unbridled tongues \n Against the wise and good; nor do I class them \n As men at all, but only as jokes and playthings. \n Meantime they live at ease, and gather up \n Good store of wealth to keep within their houses. \n \n \n And Parmeniscus of Metapontum, as Semus tells us in the fifth book of his Delias,\n a man of the highest consideration both as to family and in respect of his riches,\n having gone down to the cave of Trophonius, after he had come up again, was not\n able to laugh at all. And when he consulted the oracle on this subject, the\n Pythian priestess replied to him\u2014 \n You're asking me, you laughless man, \n About the power to laugh again; \n Your mother 'll give it you at home, \n If you with reverence to her come. \n So, on this, he hoped that when he returned to his country he should be\n able to laugh again; but when he found that he could laugh no more now than he\n could before, he considered that he had been deceived; till, by some chance, he\n came to Delos; and as he was admiring everything he saw in the island, he came\n into the temple of Latona, expecting to see some very superb statue of the mother\n of Apollo; but when he saw only a wooden shapeless figure, he unexpectedly burst\n out laughing. And then, comparing what had happened with the oracle of the god,\n and being cured of his infirmity, he honoured the goddess greatly. \n ","2":"\n Now Anaxandrides, in his Old Man's Madness, says that it was Rhadamanthus and\n Palamedes who invented the fashion of jesters; and his words are these:\u2014 \n \n And yet we labour much. \n But Palamedes first, and Rhadamanthus, \n Sought those who bring no other contribution, \n But say amusing things. \n \n \n Xenophon also, in his Banquet, mentions jesters; introducing Philip, of whom he\n speaks in the following manner: \u2014 But Philip the jester, having knocked at\n the door, told the boy who answered, to tell the guests who he was, and that he\n was desirous to be admitted; and he said that he came provided with everything\n which could qualify him for supping at other people's expense. And he said,\n too, that his boy was in a good deal of distress because he had brought\n nothing, and because he had had no dinner. And Hippolochus the\n Macedonian, in his epistle to Lynceus, mentions the jesters Mandrogenes and Strato\n the Athenian. And at Athens there was a great deal of this kind of cleverness.\n Accordingly, in the Heracleum at Diomea they assembled to the number of sixty, and they were always spoken of in\n the city as amounting to that number, in such expressions as\u2014 The sixty said\n this, and, I am come from the sixty. And among them were\n Callimedon, nicknamed the Crab, and Dinias, and also Mnasigeiton and Men\u00e6chmus, as\n Telephanes tells us in his treatise on the City. And their reputation for amusing\n qualities was so great, that Philip the Macedonian heard of it, and sent them a\n talent to engage them to write out their witticisms and send them to him. And the\n fact of this king having been a man who was very fond of jokes is testified to us\n by Demosthenes the orator in his Philippics. \n Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very eager for anything which could make him\n laugh, as Phylarchus tells us in the sixth book of his History. And he it was who\n said, that the palace of Lysimachus was in no respect different from a\n comic theatre; for that there was no one there bigger than a\n dissyllable \n (meaning to laugh at Bithys and Paris, who had more\n influence than anybody with Lysimachus, and at some others of his friends;)\n but that his friends were Peucesteses, and\n Menelauses, and Oxythemises. But when Lysimachus heard this, he\n said,\u2014 I, however, never saw a prostitute on the stage in a\n tragedy; referring to Lamia the female flute-player. And when this was\n reported to Demetrius, he rejoined,\u2014 But the prostitute who is with me,\n lives in a more modest manner than the Penelope who is with him. \n \n ","3":"\n And we have mentioned before this that Sylla, the general of the Romans, was very\n fond of anything laughable. And Lucius Anicius, who was also a general of the\n Romans, after he had subdued the Illyrians, and brought with him Genthius the king\n of the Illyrians as his prisoner, with all his children, when he was celebrating\n his triumphal games at Rome, did many things of the most laughable character\n possible, as Polybius relates in his thirtieth book:\u2014 For having sent for\n the most eminent artists from Greece, and having erected a very large theatre\n in the circus, he first of all introduced all the flute-players. And these were\n Theodorus the B\u0153otian, and Theopompus, and Hermippus, surnamed Lysimachus, who\n were the most eminent men in their profession. And having brought these men in\n front of the stage after the chorus was over, he ordered them all to play the\n flute. And as they accompanied their music with appropriate gestures, he sent\n to them and said that they were not playing well, and desired them to be more\n vehement. And while they were in perplexity, one of the lictors told them that\n what Anicius wished was that they should turn round so as to advance towards\n each other, and give a representation of a battle. And then the flute-players,\n taking this hint, and adopting a movement not unsuited to their habitual\n wantonness, caused a great tumult and confusion; and turning the middle of the\n chorus towards the extremities, the flute-players, all blowing unpremeditated\n notes, and letting their flutes be all out of tune, rushed upon one another in\n turn: and at the same time the choruses, all making a noise to correspond to\n them, and coming on the stage at the same time, rushed also upon one another,\n and then again retreated, advancing and retreating alternately. But when one of\n the chorus-dancers tucked up his garment, and suddenly turned round and raised\n his hands against the flute-player who was coming towards him, as if he was\n going to box with him, then there arose an extraordinary \n clapping and shouting on the part of the spectators. And while all these men\n were fighting as if in regular battle, two dancers were introduced into the\n orchestra with a symphony, and four boxers mounted the stage, with trumpeters\n and horn-players: and when all these men were striving together, the spectacle\n was quite indescribable: and as for the tragedians, says Polybius,\n if I were to attempt to describe what took place with respect to them, I\n should be thought by some people to be jesting. \n \n ","4":"\n Now when Ulpian had said thus much, and when all were laughing at the idea of this\n exhibition of Anicius, a discussion arose about the men who are called \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9. And the question was asked, Whether there was\n any mention of these men in any of the ancient authors? for of the jugglers\n ( \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1f76 ) we have already spoken: and\n Magnus said,\u2014 Dionysius of Sinope, the comic poet, in his play entitled the\n Namesakes, mentions Cephisodorus the \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 in the\n following terms:\u2014 \n They say that once there was a man at Athens, \n A \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, named Cephisodorus, who \n Devoted all his life to this pursuit; \n And he, whenever to a hill he came, \n Ran straight up to the top; but then descending \n Came slowly down, and leaning on a stick. \n And Nicostratus also mentions him in his Syrian\u2014 \n They say the \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 Cephisodorus once \n Most wittily station'd in a narrow lane \n A crowd of men with bundles of large faggots, \n So that no one else could pass that way at all. \n There was also a man named Pantaleon, who is mentioned by Theognetus, in\n his Slave devoted to his Master\u2014 \n Pantaleon himself did none deceive ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1 ) \n Save only foreigners, and those, too, such \n As ne'er had heard of him: and often he, \n After a drunken revel, would pour forth \n All sorts of jokes, striving to raise a laugh \n By his unceasing chattering. \n And Chrysippus the philosopher, in the fifth book of his treatise on\n Honour and Pleasure, writes thus of Pantaleon: \u2014 But Pantaleon the \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, when he was at the point of death, deceived\n every one of his sons separately, telling each of them that he was the only one\n to whom he was revealing the place where he had buried his gold; so that they\n after- wards went and dug together to no purpose, and then\n found out that they had been all deceived. \n \n ","5":"\n And our party was not deficient in men fond of raising a laugh by bitter speeches.\n And respecting a man of this kind, Chrysippus subsequently, in the same book,\n writes as follows:\u2014 Once when a man fond of saying bitter things was about\n to be put to death by the executioner, he said that he wished to die like the\n swan, singing a song; and when he gave him leave, he ridiculed him. And\n Myrtilus having had a good many jokes cut on him by people of this sort, got\n angry, and said that Lysimachus the king had done a very sensible thing; for he,\n hearing Telesphorus, one of his lieutenants, at an entertainment, ridiculing\n Arsinoe (and she was the wife of Lysimachus), as being a woman in the habit of\n vomiting, in the following line\u2014 \n You begin ill, introducing \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, \n \u2014 \n ordered him to be put in a cage ( \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03ac\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1 ) and carried about like a wild beast, and fed; and he punished\n him in this way till he died. But if you, O Ulpian, raise a question about the\n word \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03ac\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1, it occurs in Hyperides the orator;\n and the passage you may find out for yourself. \n And Tachaos the king of Egypt ridiculed Agesilaus king of Laced\u00e6mon, when he came\n to him as an ally (for he was a very short man), and lost his, kingdom in\n consequence, as Agesilaus abandoned his alliance. And the expression of Tachaos\n was as follows:\u2014 \n The mountain was in labour; Jupiter \n Was greatly frighten'd: lo! a mouse was born. \n And Agesilaus hearing of this, and being indignant at it, said, I\n will prove a lion to you. So afterwards, when the Egyptians revolted\n (as Theopompus relates, and Lyceas of Naucratis confirms the statement in his\n History of Egypt), Agesilaus refused to cooperate with him, and, in consequence,\n Tachaos lost his kingdom, and fled to the Persians. \n ","6":"\n So as there was a great deal of music introduced, and not always the same\n instruments, and as there was a good deal of discussion and conversation about\n them, (without always giving the names of those who took part in it,) I will\n enumerate the chief things which were said. For concerning \n flutes, somebody said that Melanippides, in his Marsyas, dis- paraging the art of\n playing the flute, had said very cleverly about Minerva:\u2014 \n Minerva cast away those instruments \n Down from her sacred hand; and said, in scorn, \n \"Away, you shameful things\u2014you stains of the body! \n Shall I now yield myself to such malpractices'\" \n And some one, replying to him, said,\u2014But Telestes of Selinus, in\n opposition to Melanippides, says in his Argo (and it is of Minerva that he too is\n speaking):\u2014 \n It seems to me a scarcely credible thing \n That the wise Pallas, holiest of goddesses, \n Should in the mountain groves have taken up \n That clever instrument, and then again \n Thrown it away, fearing to draw her mouth \n Into an unseemly shape, to be a glory \n To the nymph-born, noisy monster Marsyas. \n For how should chaste Minerva be so anxious \n About her beauty, when the Fates had given her \n A childless, husbandless virginity? \n intimating his belief that she, as she was and always was to continue a\n maid, could not be alarmed at the idea of disfiguring her beauty. And in a\n subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n But this report, spread by vain-speaking men, \n Hostile to every chorus, flew most causelessly \n Through Greece, to raise an envy and reproach \n Against the wise and sacred art of music. \n And after this, in an express panegyric on the art of flute-playing, he\n says\u2014 \n And so the happy breath of the holy goddess \n Bestow'd this art divine on Bromius, \n With the quick motion of the nimble fingers. \n And very neatly, in his Aesculapius, has Telestes vindicated the use of\n the flute, where he says\u2014 \n And that wise Phrygian king who first poured forth \n The notes from sweetly-sounding sacred flutes, \n Rivalling the music of the Doric Muse, \n Embracing with his well-join'd reeds the breath \n Which fills the flute with tuneful modulation. \n \n \n ","7":"\n And Pratinas the Phliasian says, that when some hired flute-players and\n chorus-dancers were occupying the orchestra, some people were indignant because\n the flute-players did not play in tune to the choruses, as was the national\n custom, but the choruses instead sang, keeping time to the flutes. And what his opinion and feelings were towards those who did this,\n Pratinas declares in the following hyporchema:\u2014 \n What noise is this \n What mean these songs of dancers now? \n What new unseemly fashion \n Has seized upon this stage to Bacchus sacred, \n Now echoing with various noise? \n Bromius is mine! is mine! \n I am the man who ought to sing, \n I am the man who ought to raise the strain, \n Hastening o'er the hills, \n In swift inspired dance among the Naiades; \n Blending a song of varied strain, \n Like the sweet dying swan. \n You, O Pierian Muse, the sceptre sway \n Of holy song: \n And after you let the shrill flute resound; \n For that is but the handmaid \n Of revels, where men combat at the doors, \n And fight with heavy fists. \n \n * * * * * \n And is the leader fierce of bloody quarrel. \n Descend, O Bacchus, on the son of Phryn\u00e6us, \n The leader of the changing choir,\u2014 \n Chattering, untimely, leading on \n The rhythm of the changing song. \n * * * * w \n King of the loud triumphal dithyrambic, \n Whose brow the ivy crowns, \n Hear this my Doric song. \n \n \n ","8":"\n And of the union of flutes with the lyre (for that concert has often been a great\n delight to us ourselves), Ephippus, in his Traffic, speaks as follows:\u2014 \n Clearly, O youth, the music of the flute, \n And that which from the lyre comes, does suit \n Well with our pastimes; for when each resound \n In unison with the feelings of those present, \n Then is the greatest pleasure felt by all. \n And the exact meaning of the word \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 is shown by Semus the Delian, in the fifth book of his\n Delias, where he writes\u2014 But as the term 'concert' ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 ) is not understood by many people, we must speak of it.\n It is wren there is a union of the flute and of rhythm in alternation, without\n any words accompanying the melody. And Antiphanes explains it very\n neatly in his Flute-player, where he says\u2014 \n \n Tell me, I pray you, what this concert ( \u1f21 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\n \u03b1\u1f35\u03c4\u03b7 ) was \n Which he did give you. For you know; but they \n Having well learnt, still played. . . . . . . . \n * * * * * \n A concert of sweet sounds, apart from words, \n Is pleasant, and not destitute of meaning. \n But the poets frequently call the flute the Libyan flute, \n as Duris remarks in the second book of his History of Agathocles, because\n Seirites, who appears to have been the first inventor of the art of flute-playing,\n was a Libyan, of one of the Nomad tribes; and he was the first person who played\n airs on the flute in the festival of Cybele.\" And the different kinds of airs\n which can be played on the flute (as Tryphon tells us in the second book of his\n treatise on Names) have the following names:\u2014the Comus, the Bucoliasmus, the\n Gingras, the Tetracomus, the Epiphallus, the Choreus, the Callinicus, the Martial,\n the Hedycomus, the Sicynnotyrbe, the Thyrocopicum, which is the same as the\n Crousithyrum (or Door-knocker), the Cnismus, the Mothon. And all these airs on the\n flute, when played, were accompanied with dancing. \n ","9":"\n Tryphon also gives a list of the different names of songs, as follows. He\n says\u2014\"There is the Him\u00e6us, which is also called the Millstone song, which men used\n to sing while grinding corn, perhaps from the word \u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2. . But \u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2 is a Dorian\n word, signifying a return, and also the quantity of corn which the millers gave\n into the bargain. Then there is the Elinus, which is the song of the men who\n worked at the loom; as Epicharmus shows us in his Atalantas. There is also the\n Ioulos, sung by the women who spin. And Semus the Delian, in his treatise on\n P\u00e6ans, says\u2014'\"They used to call the handfuls of barley taken separately, \u1f04\u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9; but when they were collected so that a great\n many were made into one sheaf, then they were called \u03bf\u1f54\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 and \u1f34\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9. . And Ceres herself\n was called sometimes Chloe, and sometimes Ioulo; and, as being the inventions of\n this goddess, both the fruits of the ground and also the songs addressed to the\n goddess were called \u03bf\u1f56\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 and \u1f34\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 : and so, too, we have the words \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 and \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, and the line\u2014 \n \n \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f35\u03b5\u03b9, \u1f34\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f35\u03b5\u03b9. \n \n But others say that the Ioulis is the song of the workers in wool. There are also the songs of nurses, which are called\n \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. There was also a song used at\n the feast of Swings, \n in honour of Erigone, which is called Aletis. At all events, Aristotle says, in\n his treatise on the Constitution of the Colophonians\u2014 Theodorus also himself\n died afterwards by a violent death. And he is said to have been a very\n luxurious man, as is evident from his poetry; for even now the women sing his\n songs on the festival of the Swing. \n \n There was also a reaper's song called Lityerses; and another song sung by hired\n servants when going to the fields, as Teleclides tells us in his Amphictyons.\n There were songs, too, of bathing men, as we learn from Crates in his Deeds of\n Daring; and a song of women baking, as Aristophanes intimates in his\n Thesmophoriazus\u00e6, and Nicochares in his Hercules Choregus. And another song in use\n among those who drove herds, and this was called the Bucoliasmus. And the man who\n first invented this species of song was Diomus, a Sicilian cowherd; and it is\n mentioned by Epicharmus in his Halcyon, and in his Ulysses Shipwrecked. The song\n used at deaths and in mourning is called Olophyrmus; and the songs called Iouli\n are used in honour of Ceres and Proserpine. The song sung in honour of Apollo is\n called Philhelias, as we learn from Telesilla; and those addressed to Diana are\n called Upingi. \n There were also laws composed by Charondas, which were sung at Athens at\n drinking-parties; as Hermippus tells us in the sixth book of his treatise on\n Lawgivers. And Aristophanes, in his catalogue of Attic Expressions, say\u2014 The\n Him\u00e6us is the song of people grinding; the Hymen\u00e6us is the song used at\n marriage-feasts; and that employed in lamentation is called Ialemus. But the\n Linus and the Aelinus are not confined to occasions of mourning, but are in use\n also in good fortune, as we may gather from Euripides. \n \n ","10":"\n But Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on matters relating to Love, says\n that there was a kind of song called Nomium, derived from Eriphanis; and his words\n are these:\u2014\"Eriphanis was a lyric poetess, the mistress of Menalcas the hunter;\n and she, pursuing him with her passions, hunted too. For often frequenting the\n mountains, and wandering over them, she came to the different\n groves, equal- ling in her wanderings the celebrated journeys of Io; so that not\n only those men who were most remarkable for their deficiency in the tender\n passion, but even the fiercest beasts, joined in weeping for her misfortunes,\n perceiving the lengths to which her passionate hopes carried her. Therefore she\n wrote poems; and when she had composed them, as it is said, she roamed about the\n desert, shouting and singing the kind of song called Nomium, in which the burden\n of the song is\u2014 \n The lofty oaks, Menalcas.\" \n \n \n And Aristoxenus, in the fourth book of his treatise on Music,\n says\u2014 Anciently the women used to sing a kind of song called Calyca. Now,\n this was a poem of Stesichorus, in which a damsel of the name of Calyca, being\n in love with a young man named Euathlus, prays in a modest manner to Venus to\n aid her in becoming his wife. But when the young man scorned her, she threw\n herself down a precipice. And this disaster took place near Leucas. And the\n poet has represented the disposition of the maiden as very modest; so that she\n was not willing to live with the youth on his own terms, but prayed that, if\n possible, she might become the wedded wife of Euathlus; and if that were not\n possible, that she might be released from life. But, in his Brief\n Memoranda, Aristoxenus says\u2014 Iphiclus despised Harpalyce, who was in love\n with him; but she died, and there has been a contest established among the\n virgins of songs in her honour, and the contest is called from her,\n Harpalyce. And Nymphis, in the first book of his History of Heraclea,\n speaking of the Maryandyni, says\u2014 And in the same way it is well to notice\n some songs which, in compliance with a national custom, they sing, in which\n they invoke some ancient person, whom they address as Bormus. And they say that\n he was the son of an illustrious and wealthy man, and that he was far superior\n to all his fellows in beauty and in the vigour of youth; and as he was\n superintending the cultivation of some of his own lands, and wishing to give\n his reapers something to drink, he went to fetch some water, and disappeared.\n Accordingly, they say that on this the natives of the country sought him with a\n kind of dirge and invocation set to music, which even to this day they are in\n the habit of using frequently. And a similar kind of song\n is that which is in use among the Egyp- tians, and is called Maneros. \n \n ","11":"\n Moreover, there were rhapsodists also present at our entertainments: for\n Laurentius delighted in the reciters of Homer to an extraordinary degree; so that\n one might call Cassander the king of Macedonia a trifler in comparison of him;\n concerning whom Carystius, in his Historic Recollections, tells us that he was so\n devoted to Homer, that he could say the greater part of his poems by heart; and he\n had a copy of the Iliad and the Odyssey written out with his own hand. And that\n these reciters of Homer were called Homerist\u00e6 also, Aristocles has told us in his\n treatise on Choruses. But those who are now called Homerist\u00e6 were first introduced\n on the stage by Demetrius Phalereus. \n Now Cham\u00e6leon, in his essay on Stesichorus, says that not only the poems of Homer,\n but those also of Hesiod and Archilochus, and also of Mimnermus and Phocylides,\n were often recited to the accompaniment of music; and Clearchus, in the first book\n of his treatise on Pictures, says\u2014 Simonides of Zacynthus used to sit in the\n theatres on a lofty chair reciting the verses of Archilochus. And\n Lysanias, in the first book of his treatise on Iambic Poets, says that Mnasion the\n rhapsodist used in his public recitations to deliver some of the Iambics of\n Simonides. And Cleomenes the rhapsodist, at the Olympic games, recited the\n Purification of Empedocles, as is asserted by Dic\u00e6archus in his history of\n Olympia. And Jason, in the third book of his treatise on the Temples of Alexander,\n says that Hegesias, the comic actor, recited the works of Herodotus in the great\n theatre, and that Hermophantus recited the poems of Homer. \n ","12":"\n And the men called Hilarodists (whom some people at the present day call\n Simodists, as Aristocles tells us in his first book on Choruses, because Simus the\n Magnesian was the most celebrated of all the poets of joyous songs,) frequently\n come under our notice. And Aristocles also gives a regular list of them in his\n treatise on Music, here he speaks in the following manner:\u2014 The Magodist\u2014but\n he is the same as the Lysiodist. But Aristoxenus says that Magodus is\n the name given to an actor who acts both male and female characters; but that he who acts\n a woman's part in combination with a man's is called a\n Lysiodist. And they both sing the same songs, and in other respects they are\n similar. \n The Ionic dialect also supplies us with poems of Sotades, and with what before his\n time were called Ionic poems, such as those of Alexander the Aetolian, and Pyres\n the Milesian, and Alexas, and other poets of the same kind; and Sotades is called\n \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2. And Sotades the Maronite was very\n notorious for this kind of poetry, as Carystius of Pergamus says in his essay on\n Sotades; and so was the son of Sotades, Apollonius: and this latter also wrote an\n essay on his father's poetry, from which one may easily see the unbridled licence\n of language which Sotades allowed himself,\u2014abusing Lysimachus the king in\n Alexandria,\u2014and, when at the court of Lysimachus, abusing Ptolemy\n Philadelphus,-and in different cities speaking ill of different sovereigns; on\n which account, at last, he met with the punishment that he deserved: for when he\n had sailed from Alexandria (as Hegesander, in his Reminiscences, relates), and\n thought that he had escaped all danger, (for he had said many bitter things\n against Ptolemy the king, and especially this, after he had heard that he had\n married his sister Arsinoe,\u2014 \n He pierced forbidden fruit with deadly sting,) \n Patrocles, the general of Ptolemy, caught him in the island of Caunus,\n and shut him up in a leaden vessel, and carried him into the open sea and drowned\n him. And his poetry is of this kind: Philenus was the father of Theodorus the\n fluteplayer, on whom he wrote these lines:\u2014 \n And he, opening the door which leads from the back-street, \n Sent forth vain thunder from a leafy cave, \n Such as a mighty ploughing ox might utter. \n \n \n ","13":"\n But the Hilarodus, as he is called, is a more respectable kind of poet than these\n men are; for he is never effeminate or indecorous, but he wears a white manly\n robe, and he is crowned with a golden crown: and in former times he used to wear\n sandals, as Aristocles tells us; but at the present day he wears only slippers.\n And some man or woman sings an accompaniment to him, as to a person who sings to\n the flute. And a crown is given to a Hilarodus, as well as to a person who sings\n to the flute; but such honours are not allowed to a player on the harp or on the\n flute. But the man who is called a Magodus has drums and cymbals, and wears all\n kinds of woman's attire; and he behaves in an effeminate\n manner, and does every sort of indecorous, indecent thing,\u2014imitating at one time a\n woman, at another an adulterer or a pimp: or sometimes he represents a drunken\n man, or even a serenade offered by a reveller to his mistress. And Aristoxeus says\n that the business of singing joyous songs is a respectable one, and somewhat akin\n to tragedy; but that the business of a Magodus is more like comedy. And very often\n it happens that the Magodi, taking the argument of some comedy, represent it\n according to their own fashion and manner. And the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 was derived from the fact that those who addicted themselves\n to the practice, uttered things like magical incantations, and often declared the\n power of various drugs. \n ","14":"\n But there was among the Laced\u00e6monians an ancient kind of comic diversion, as\n Sosibius says, not very important or serious, since Sparta aimed at plainness even\n in pastimes. And the way was, that some one, using very plain, unadorned language,\n imitated persons stealing fruit, or else some foreign physician speaking in this\n way, as Allexis, in his Woman who has taken Mandragora, represents one: and he\n says\u2014 \n If any surgeon of the country says, \n \"Give him at early dawn a platter full \n Of barley-broth,\" we shall at once despise him; \n But if he says the same with foreign accent, \n We marvel and admire him. If he call \n The beet-root \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, we disregard\n him; \n But if he style it \u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, we listen, \n And straightway, with attention fix'd, obey; \n As if there were such difference between \n \n \u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and \u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n And those who practised this kind of sport were called among the\n Laced\u00e6monians \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76, which is a term\n equivalent to \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1f76 or \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03af. \n There are,\n however, many names, varying in different places, for this class of \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af; for the Sicyonians call them \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, and others call them \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, and some call them \u03c6\u03bb\u03cd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, as the Italians do; but people in general call them\n Sophists: and the Thebans, who are very much in the habit of giving peculiar lames\n to many things, call them \u1f10\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03af. But that the\n Thebans do introduce all kinds of innovations with respect to words, Strattis\n shows us in the Ph\u0153niss\u00e6, where he says\u2014 \n \n You, you whole body of Theban citizens, \n Know absolutely nothing; for I hear \n You call the cuttle-fish not \u03c3\u03b7\u03c0\u03af\u03b1, \n \n But \u1f40\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1.

But at a later time both they and\n their poems were called Iambics. And those, he proceeds, who are\n called Ithyphalli, wear a mask representing the face of a drunken man, and wear\n crowns, having gloves embroidered with flowers. And they wear tunics shot with\n white; and they wear a Tarentine robe, which covers them down to their ancles:\n and they enter at the stage entrance silently, and when they have reached the\n middle of the orchestra, they turn towards the spectators, and say\u2014 \n Out of the way; a clear space leave \n For the great mighty god: \n For the god, to his ancles clad, \n Will pass along the centre of the crowd. \n And the Phallophori, says he, wear no masks; but they\n put on a sort of veil of wild thyme, and on that they put acanthi, and an\n untrimmed garland of violets and ivy; and they clothe themselves in Caunac\u00e6,\n and so come on the stage, some at the side, and others through the centre\n entrance, walking in exact musical time, and saying\u2014 \n For you, O Bacchus, do we now set forth - \n This tuneful song; uttering in various melody \n This simple rhythm. \n It is a song unsuited to a virgin; \n Nor are we now addressing you with hymns \n Made long ago, but this our offering \n Is fresh unutter'd praise. \n And then, advancing, they used to ridicule with their jests whoever\n they chose; and they did this standing still, but the Phallophorus himself\n marched straight on, covered with soot and dirt. \n \n ","16":"\n And since we are on this subject, it is as well not to omit\n what happened to Am\u0153beus, a harp-player of our time, and a man of great science\n and skill in everything that related to music. He once came late to one of our\n banquets, and when he heard from one of the servants that we had all finished\n supper, he doubted what to do himself, until Sophon the cook came to him, and with\n a loud voice, so that every one might hear, recited to him these lines out of the\n Auge of Eubulus:\u2014 \n O wretched man, why stand you at the doors \n Why don't you enter'? Long ago the geese \n Have all been deftly carved limb from limb; \n Long the hot pork has had the meat cut off \n From the long backbone, and the stuffing, which \n Lay in the middle of his stomach, has \n Been served around; and all his pettitoes, \n The dainty slices of fat, well-season'd sausages, \n Have all been eaten. The well-roasted cuttle-fish \n Is swallow'd long ago; and nine or ten \n Casks of rich wine are drain'd to the very dregs. \n So if you'd like some fragments of the feast, \n Hasten and enter. Don't, like hungry wolf, \n Losing this feast, then run about at random. \n For as that delightful writer Antiphanes says, in his Friend of the\n Thebans,\u2014 \n \n A. We now are well supplied with everything; \n For she, the namesake of the dame within, \n The rich B\u0153otian eel, carved in the depths \n Of the ample dish, is warm, and swells, and boils, \n And bubbles up, and smokes; so that a man, \n E'en though equipp'd with brazen nostrils, scarcely \n Could bear to leave a banquet such as this,\u2014 \n So rich a fragrance does it yield his senses. \n \n B. Say you the cook is living \n \n A. There is near \n A cestreus, all unfed both night and day, \n Scaled, wash'd, and stain'd with cochineal, and turned; \n And as he nears his last and final turn \n He cracks and hisses; while the servant bastes \n The fish with vinegar: then there's Libyan silphium, \n Dried in the genial rays of midday sun:\u2014 \n \n B. Yet there are people found who dare to say \n That sorcerers possess no sacred power; \n For now I see three men their bellies filling \n While you are turning this. \n \n A. And the comrade squid \n Bearing the form of the humpback'd cuttlefish, \n Dreadful with armed claws and sharpen'd talons, \n Changing its brilliant snow-white nature under \n \n The fiery blasts of glowing coal, adorns \n Its back with golden splendour; well exciting \n Hunger, the best forerunner of a feast. \n So, come in\u2014 \n Do not delay, but enter: when we've dined \n We then can best endure what must be borne. \n And so he, meeting him in this appropriate manner, replies with these\n lines out of the Harper of Clearchus:\u2014 \n Sup on white congers, and whatever else \n Can boast a sticky nature; for by such food \n The breath is strengthen'd, and the voice of man \n Is render'd rich and powerful. \n And as there was great applause on this, and as every one with one accord\n called to him to come in, he went in and drank, and taking the lyre, sang to us in\n such a manner that we all marvelled at his skill on the harp, and at the rapidity\n of his execution, and at the tunefulness of his voice; for he appeared to me to be\n not at all inferior to that ancient Am\u0153beus, whom Aristeas, in his History of\n Harp-players, speaks of as living at Athens, and dwelling near the theatre, and\n receiving an Attic talent a-day every time he went out singing. \n ","17":"\n And while some were discussing music in this manner, and others of the guests\n saying different things every day, but all praising the pastime, Masurius, who\n excelled in everything, and was a man of universal wisdom, (for as an interpreter\n of the laws he was inferior to no one, and he was always devoting some of his\n attention to music, for indeed he was able himself to play on some musical\n instruments,) said, \u2014My good friends, Eupolis the comic poet says\u2014 \n And music is a deep and subtle science, \n And always finding out some novelty \n For those who 're capable of comprehending it; \n on which account Anaxilas, in his Hyacinthus, says\u2014 \n For, by the gods I swear, music, like Libya, \n Brings forth each year some novel prodigy; \n for, my dear fellows, Music, as the Harp-player of\n Theophilus says, is a great and lasting treasure to all who have learnt it\n and know anything about it; for it ameliorates the disposition, and\n softens those who are passionate and quarrelsome in their tempers. Accordingly,\n Clinias the Pythagorean, as Cham\u00e6leon of Pontus relates,\n who was a most unimpeachable man both in his actual\n conduct and also in his disposition, if ever it happened to him to get out of\n temper or indignant at anything, would take up his lyre and play upon it. And\n when people asked him the reason of this conduct, he used to say, 'I am\n pacifying myself.' And so, too, the Achilles of Homer was mollified by the\n music of the harp, which is all that Homer allots to him out of the spoils of\n Eetion, as being able to check his fiery temper. And he is the only hero in the\n whole Iliad who indulges in this music. \n \n Now, that music can heal diseases, Theophrastus asserts in his treatise on\n Enthusiasm, where he says that men with diseases in the loins become free from\n pain if any one plays a Phrygian air opposite to the part affected. And the\n Phrygians are the first people who invented and employed the harmony which goes by\n their name; owing to which circumstance it is that the flute-players among the\n Greeks have usually Phrygian and servile-sounding names, such as Sambas in Aleman,\n and Adon, and Telus. And in Hipponax we find Cion, and Codalus, and Babys, from\n whom the proverb arose about men who play worse and worse,\u2014 He plays worse\n than Babys. But Aristoxenus ascribes the invention of this harmony to\n Hyagnis the Phrygian. \n ","18":"\n But Heraclides of Pontus, in the third book of his treatise on Music, says\u2014\"Now\n that harmony ought not to be called Phrygian, just as it has no right either to be\n called Lydian. For there are three harmonies; as there are also three different\n races of Greeks-Dorians, Aeolians, and] Ionians: and accordingly there is no\n little difference between their manners. The Laced\u00e6monians are of all the Dorians\n the most strict in maintaining their national customs and the Thessalians (and\n these are they who were the origin of the Aeolian race) have\n preserved at all times very nearly the same customs and institutions; but the\n population of the Ionians has been a great deal changed, and has gone through many\n transitions, because they have at all times resembled whatever nations of\n barbarians have from time to time been their masters. Accordingly, that species of\n melody which the Dorians composed they called the Dorian harmony, and that which\n the Aeolians used to sing they named the Aeolian harmony, and the third they\n called the Ionian, because they heard the Ionians sing it. \n \"Now the Dorian harmony is a manly and high-sounding strain, having nothing\n relaxed or merry in it, but, rather, it is stern and vehement, not admitting any\n great variations or any sudden changes. The character of the Aeolian harmony is\n pompous and inflated, and full of a sort of pride; and these characteristics are\n very much in keeping with the fondness for breeding horses and for entertaining\n strangers which the people itself exhibits. There is nothing mean in it, but the\n style is elevated and fearless; and therefore we see that a fondness for banquets\n and for amorous indulgences is common to the whole nation, and they indulge in\n every sort of relaxation: on which account they cherish the style of the\n Sub-Dorian harmony; for that which they call the Aeolian is, says Heraclides, a\n sort of modification of the Dorian, and is called \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. . And we may collect the character of this Aeolian harmony\n also from what Lasus of Hermione says in his hymn to the Ceres in Hermione, where\n he speaks as follows:\u2014 \n I sing the praise of Ceres and of Proserpine, \n The sacred wife of Clymenus, Melib\u0153a; \n Raising the heavy-sounding harmony \n Of hymns Aeolian. \n But these Sub-Dorian songs, as they are called, are sung by nearly\n everybody. Since, then, there is a Sub-Dorian melody, it is with great propriety\n that Lasus speaks of Aeolian harmony. Pratinas, too, somewhere or other says\u2014\n \n Aim not at too sustain'd a style, nor yet \n At the relax'd Ionian harmony; \n But draw a middle furrow through your ground, \n And follow the Eolian muse in preference. \n And in what comes afterwards he speaks more plainly\u2014- \n But to all men who wish to raise their voices, \n The Aeolian harmony's most suitable. \n \n \"Now formerly, as I have said, they used to call this the\n Aeolian harmony, but afterwards they gave it the name of the Sub-Dorian, thinking,\n as some people say, that it was pitched lower on the flute than the Dorian. But it\n appears to me that those who gave it this name, seeing its inflated style, and the\n pretence to valour and virtue which was put forth in the style of the harmony,\n thought it not exactly the Dorian harmony, but to a certain extent like it: on\n which account they called it \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, just as\n they call what is nearly white \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd : and what\n is not absolutely sweet, but something near it, we call \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03c5; so, too, we call what is not thoroughly Dorian \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n ","19":"\n \"Next in order let us consider the character of the Milesians, which the Ionians\n display, being very proud of the goodly appearance of their persons; and full of\n spirit, hard to be reconciled to their enemies, quarrelsome, displaying no\n philanthropic or cheerful qualities, but rather a want of affection and\n friendship, and a great moroseness of disposition: on which account the Ionian\n style of harmony also is not flowery nor mirthful, but austere and harsh, and\n having a sort of gravity in it, which, however, is not ignoble-looking; on which\n account that tragedy has a sort of affection for that harmony. But the manners of\n the Ionians of the present day are more luxurious, and the character of their\n present music is very far removed from the Ionian harmony we have been speaking\n of. And men say that Pythermus the Teian wrote songs such as are called Scolia in\n this kind of harmony; and that it was because he was an Ionian poet that the\n harmony got the name of Ionian. This is that Pythermus whom Ananius or Hipponax\n mentions in his Iambics in this way:\u2014 \n Pythermus speaks of gold as though all else were nought. \n And Pythermus's own words are as follows:\u2014 \n All other things but gold are good for nothing. \n Therefore, according to this statement, it is probable that Pythermus, as\n coming from those parts. adapted the character of his melodies to the disposition\n of the Ionians; on which account I suppose that his was not actually the Ionian\n harmony, but that it was a harmony adapted in some a admirable manner to the\n purpose required. And those are contemptible people who are\n unable to distinguish the characteristic differences of these separate harmonies;\n but who are led away by the sharpness or flatness of the sounds, so as to describe\n one harmony as \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b9\u03be\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and then again to\n give a definition of some further sort, refining on this: for I do not think that\n even that which is called the \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 has a\n distinct character of its own, although some people do say that they have invented\n a new harmony which they call Sub-Phrygian ( \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ). Now every kind of harmony ought to have some distinct\n species of character or of passion; as the Locrian has, for this was a harmony\n used by some of those who lived in the time of Simonides and Pindar, but\n subsequently it fell into contempt. \n ","20":"\n \"There are, then, as we have already said, three kinds of harmony, as there are\n three nations of the Greek people. But the Phrygian and Lydian harmonies, being\n barbaric, became known to the Greeks by means of the Phrygians and Lydians who\n came over to Peloponnesus with Pelops. For many Lydians accompanied and followed\n him, because Sipylus was a town of Lydia; and many Phrygians did so too, not\n because they border on the Lydians, but because their king also was Tantalus\u2014(and\n you may see all over Peloponnesus, and most especially in Laced\u00e6mon, great mounds,\n which the people there call the tombs of the Phrygians who came over with\n Pelops)\u2014and from them the Greeks learnt these harmonies: on which account Telestes\n of Selinus says\u2014 \n First of all, Greeks, the comrades brave of Pelops, \n Sang o'er their wine, in Phrygian melody, \n The praises of the mighty Mountain Mother; \n But others, striking the shrill strings of the lyre, \n Gave forth a Lydian hymn.\" \n \n \n ","21":"\n \n But we must not admit, says Polybius of Megalopolis, \"that music,\n as Ephorus asserts, was introduced among men for the purposes of fraud and\n trickery. Nor must we think that the ancient Cretans and Laced\u00e6monians used flutes\n and songs at random to excite their military ardour, instead of trumpets. Nor are\n we to imagine that the earliest Arcadians had no reason whatever for doing so,\n when they introduced music into every department of their management of the\n republic; so that, though the nation in every other respect was most austere in\n its manner of life, they nevertheless com- pelled music to be\n the constant companion, not only of their boys, but even of their youths up to\n thirty years of age. For the Arcadians are the only people among whom the boys are\n trained from infancy to sing hymns and p\u00e6ans to regular airs, in which indeed\n every city celebrates their national heroes and gods with such songs, in obedience\n to ancient custom. \n \"But after this, learning the airs of Timotheus and Philoxenus, they every year,\n at the festival of Bacchus, dance in their theatres to the music of flute-players;\n the boys dancing in the choruses of boys, and the youths in those of men. And\n throughout the whole duration of their lives they are addicted to music at their\n common entertainments; not so much, however, employing musicians as singing in\n turn: and to admit themselves ignorant of any other accomplishment is not at all\n reckoned discreditable to them; but to refuse to sing is accounted a most\n disgraceful thing. And they, practising marches so as to march in order to the\n sound of the flute, and studying their dances also, exhibit every year in the\n theatres, under public regulations and at the public expense. These, then, are the\n customs which they have derived from the ancients, not for the sake of luxury and\n superfluity, but from a consideration of the austerity which each individual\n practised in his private life, and of the severity of their characters, which they\n contract from the cold and gloomy nature of the climate which prevails in the\n greater part of their country. And it is the nature of all men to be in some\n degree influenced by the climate, so as to get some resemblance to it themselves;\n and it is owing to this that we find different races of men, varying in character\n and figure and complexion, in proportion as they are more or less distant from one\n another. \n \n In addition to this, they instituted public banquets and public sacrifices,\n in which the men and women join; and also dances of the maidens and boys\n together; endevouring to mollify and civilize the harshness of their nature\n character by the influence of education and habit. And as the people of Cyn\u00e6tha\n neglected this system (although they occupy by far the most inclement district\n of Arcadia, both as respects the soil and the climate), they, never meeting one\n another except for the purpose of giving offence and quarrelling, became at\n last so utterly savage, that the very greatest impieties\n prevailed among them alone of all the people of Arcadia; and at the time when\n they made the great massacre, whatever Arcadian cities their emissaries came to\n in their passage, the citizens of all the other cities at once ordered them to\n depart by public proclamation; and the Mantineans even made a public\n purification of their city after their departure, leading victims all round\n their entire district. \n \n ","22":"\n Agias, the musician, said that the styrax, which at the Dionysiac festivals\n is burnt in the orchestras, presented a Phrygian odour to those who were within\n reach of it. Now, formerly music was an exhortation to courage; and\n accordingly Alc\u00e6us the poet, one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, places\n valour and manliness before skill in music and poetry, being himself a man warlike\n even beyond what was necessary. On which account, in such verses as these, he\n speaks in high-toned language, and says\u2014 \n My lofty house is bright with brass, \n And all my dwelling is adorn'd, in honour \n Of mighty Mars, with shining helms, \n O'er which white horsehair crests superbly wave, \n Choice ornament for manly brows; \n And brazen greaves, on mighty pegs suspended, \n Hang round the hall; fit to repel \n The heavy javelin or the long-headed spear. \n There, too, are breastplates of new linen, \n And many a hollow shield, thrown basely down \n By coward enemies in flight: \n There, too, are sharp Chalcidic swords, and belts, \n Short military cloaks besides, \n And all things suitable for fearless war; \n Which I may ne'er forget, \n Since first I girt myself for the adventurous work\u2014 \n although it would have been more suitable for him to have had his house\n well stored with musical instruments. But the ancients considered manly courage\n the greatest of all civil virtues, and they attributed the greatest importance to\n that, to the exclusion of other good qualities. Archilochus accordingly, who was a\n distinguished poet, boasted in the first place of being able to partake in all\n political undertakings, and in the second place he mentioned the credit he had\n gained by his poetical efforts, saying,\u2014 \n But I'm a willing servant of great Mars, \n Skill'd also in the Muses' lovely art. \n And, in the same spirit, Aeschylus, though a man who had acquired such great renown by his poetry, nevertheless pre-\n ferred having his valour recorded on his tomb, and composed an inscription for it,\n of which the following lines are a part:\u2014 \n The grove of Marathon, and the long-hair'd Medes; \n Who felt his courage, well may speak of it. \n \n \n ","23":"\n And it is on this account that the Laced\u00e6moians, who are a most valiant nation, go\n to war to the music of the flute, and the Cretans to the strains of the lyre, and\n the Lydians to the sound of pipes and flutes, as Herodotus relates. And, moreover,\n many of the barbarians make all their public proclamations to the accompaniment of\n flutes and harps, softening the souls of their enemies by these means. And\n Theopompus, in the forty-sixth book of his History, says\u2014 The Get\u00e6 make all\n their proclamations while holding harps in their hands and playing on\n them. And it is perhaps on this account that Homer, having due regard\n to the ancient institutions and customs of the Greeks, says\u2014 \n \n \n I hear, what graces every feast, the lyre; \n \n Odyss. xvii. 262. \n \n as if this art of music were welcome also to men feasting. \n Now it was, as it should seem, a regular custom to introduce music, in the first\n place in order that every one who might be too eager for drunkenness or gluttony\n might have music as a sort of physician and healer of his insolence and indecorum,\n and also because music softens moroseness of temper; for it dissipates sadness,\n and produces affability and a sort of gentlemanlike joy. From which consideration,\n Homer has also, in the first book of the Iliad, represented the gods as using\n music after their dissensions on the subject of Achilles; for they continued for\n some time listening to it\u2014 \n \n \n Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong \n In feasts ambrosial and celestial song: \n Apollo tuned the lyre,\u2014the Muses round, \n With voice alternate, aid the silver sound. \n \n Iliad, i. 603. \n \n For it was desirable that they should leave off their quarrels and\n dissensions, as we have said. And most people seem to attribute the practice of\n this art to banquets for the sake of setting things right, and of the general\n mutual advantage. And, besides these other occasions, the ancients also\n established by customs and laws that at feasts all men should sing hymns to the\n gods, in order by these means to preserve order and decency\n among us; for as all songs proceed according to harmony, the consideration of the\n gods being added to this harmony, elevates the feelings of each individual. And\n Philochorus says that the ancients, when making their libations, did not always\n use dithyrambic hymns, but when they pour libations, they celebrate Bacchus\n with wine and drunkenness, but Apollo with tranquillity and good order. \n Accordingly Archilochus says\u2014 \n I, all excited in my mind with wine, \n Am skilful in the dithyrambic, knowing \n The noble melodies of the sovereign Bacchus. \n And Epicharmus, in his Philoctetes, says\u2014 \n A water-drinker knows no dithyrambics. \n So, that it was not merely with a view to superficial and vulgar\n pleasure, as some assert, that music was originally introduced into\n entertainments, is plain from what has been said above. But the Laced\u00e6monians do\n not assert that they used to learn music as a science, but they do profess to be\n able to judge well of what is done in the art; and they say that they have already\n three times preserved it when it was in danger of being lost. \n ","24":"\n Music also contributes to the proper exercising of the body and to sharpening the\n intellect; on which account, every Grecian people, and every barbarian nation too,\n that we are acquainted with, practise it. And it was a good saying of Damon the\n Athenian, that songs and dances must inevitably exist where the mind was excited\n in any manner; and liberal, and gentlemanly, and honourable feelings of the mind\n produce corresponding kinds of music, and the opposite feelings likewise produce\n the opposite kinds of music. On which account, that saying of Clisthenes the\n tyrant of Sicyon was a witty one, and a sign of a well-educated intellect. For\n when he saw, as it is related, one of the suitors for his daughter\n dancing in an unseemly manner (it was Hippoclides the Athenian), he told him that\n he had danced away his marriage, thinking, as it should seem, that the mind of the\n man corresponded to the dance which he had exhibited; for in dancing and walking\n decorum and good order are honourable, and disorder and vulgarity are\n discreditable. And it is on this principle that the poets originally arranged\n dances for freeborn men, and employed figures only to be\n emblems of what was being sung, always preserving the principles of nobleness and\n manliness in them; on which account it was that they gave them the name of\n \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 (accompaniment to the dance). And if\n any one, while dancing indulged in unseemly postures or figures, and did nothing\n at all corresponding to the songs sung, he was considered blameworthy; on which\n account, Aristophanes or Plato, in his Preparations (as Cham\u00e6leon quotes the\n play), spoke thus:\u2014 \n So that if any one danced well, the sight \n Was pleasing: but they now do nothing rightly, \n But stand as if amazed, and roar at random. \n For the kind of dancing which was at that time used in the choruses was\n decorous and magnificent, and to a certain extent imitated the motions of men\n under arms; on which account Socrates in his Poems says that those men who dance\n best are the best in warlike exploits; and thus he writes:\u2014 \n But they who in the dance most suitably \n Do honour to the Gods, are likewise best \n In all the deeds of war. \n For the dance is very nearly an armed exercise, and is a dis- play not\n only of good discipline in other respects, but also of the care which the dancers\n bestow on their persons. \n ","25":"\n And Amphion the Thespi\u00e6an, in the second book of his treatise on the Temple of the\n Muses on Mount Helicon, says that in Helicon there are dances of boys, got up with\n great care, quoting this ancient epigram:\u2014 \n I both did dance, and taught the citizens \n The art of music, and my flute-player \n Was Anacus the Phialensian; \n My name was Bacchides of Sicyon; \n And this my duty to the gods perform'd \n Was honourable to my country Sicyon. \n \n \n And it was a good answer which was made by Caphesias the flute-player, when one of\n his pupils began to pay on the flute very loudly, and was endeavouring to play as\n loudly as he could; on which he struck him, and said, Goodness does not\n consist in greatness, but greatness in goodness There are also relics\n and traces of the ancient dancing in some statues which we have, which were made\n by ancient statuaries; on which account men at that time paid more attention to\n moving their hands with graceful gestures; for in his parti- \n cular also they aimed at graceful and gentlemanlike motions, comprehending what\n was great in what was well done. And from these motions of the hands they\n transferred some figures to the dances, and from the dances to the pal\u00e6stra; for\n they sought to improve their manliness by music and by paying attention to their\n persons. And they practised to the accompaniment of song with reference to their\n movements when under arms; and it was from this practice that the dance called the\n Pyrrhic dance originated, and every other dance of this kind, and all the others\n which have the same name or any similar one with a slight change: such as the\n Cretan dances called \u1f40\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 and \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; and that dance, too, which is named \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, (and it is mentioned under this name by\n Cratinus in his Nemesis, and by Cephisodorus in his Amazons, and by Aristophanes\n in his Centaur, and by several other poets,) though afterwards it came to be\n called \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2; and many women used to dance\n it, who, I am aware, were afterwards called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n ","26":"\n But the more sedate kinds of dance, both the more varied kinds and those too whose\n figures are more simple, are the following:\u2014The Dactylus, the Iambic, the\n Molossian, the Emmelea, the Cordax, the Sicinnis, the Persian, the Phrygian, the\n Nibatismus, the Thracian, the Calabrismus, the Telesias (and this is a Macedonian\n dance which Ptolemy was practising when he slew Alexander the brother of Philip,\n as Marsyas relates in the third book of his History of Macedon). The following\n dances are of a frantic kind:\u2014The Cernophorus, and the Mongas, and the\n Thermaustris. There was also a kind of dance in use among private individuals,\n called the \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1, and they used to dance this\n while repeating the following form of words with a sort of mimicking gesture,\n saying\u2014 \n Where are my roses, and where are my violets? \n Where is my beautiful parsley \n Are these then my roses, are these then my violets \n And is this my beautiful parsley? \n \n \n Among the Syracusans there was a kind of dance called the Chitoneas, sacred to\n Diana, and it is a peculiar kind of dance, accompanied with the flute. There was\n also an Ionian kind of dance practised at drinking parties. They also practised\n the dance called \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 at their drinking\n parties. And there is another kind of dance called the Burning of the World, which Menippus the Cynic mentions in his Banquet.\n There are also some dances of a ridiculous character:\u2014the Igdis, the Mactrismus,\n the Apocinus, and the Sobas; and besides these, the Morphasmus, and the Owl, and\n the Lion, and the Pouring out of Meal, and the Abolition of Debt, and the\n Elements, and the Pyrrhic dance. And they also lanced to the accompaniment of the\n flute a dance which they called the Dance of the Master of the Ship, and the\n Platter Dance. \n The figures used in dances are the Xiphismus, the Calathismus, the Callabides, the\n Scops, and the Scopeuma. And the Scops was a figure intended to represent people\n looking out from a distance, making an arch over their brows with their hand so as\n to shade their eyes. And it is mentioned by Aeschylus in his Spectators:\u2014 \n And all these old \u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 of yours. \n And Eupolis, in his Flatterers, mentions the Callabides, when he says\u2014\n \n He walks as though he were dancing the Callabides. \n \n \n Other figures are the Thermastris, the Hecaterides, the Scopus, the Hand-down, the\n Hand-up, the Dipodismus, the Taking-hold of Wood, the Epanconismus, the\n Calathiscus, the Strobilus. There is also a dance called the Telesias; and this is\n a martial kind of dance, deriving its title from a man of the name of Telesias,\n who was the first person who ever danced it, holding arms in his hands, as\n Hippagoras tells us in the first book of his treatise on the Constitution of the\n Carthaginians. \n ","27":"\n There is also a kind of satyric dance called the Sicinnis, as Aristocles says in\n the eighth book of his treatise on Dances; and the Satyrs are called Sicinnist\u00e6.\n But some say that a barbarian of the name of Sicinnus was the inventor of it,\n though others say that Sicinnus was a Cretan by birth; and certainly the Cretans\n are dancers, as is mentioned by Aristoxenus. But Scamon, in the first book of his\n treatise on Inventions, says that this dance is called Sicinnis, from being shaken\n ( \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ), and that Thersippus was the\n first person who danced the Sicinnis. Now in dancing, the motion of the feet was\n adopted long before any motion of the lands was considered requisite; for the\n ancients exercised their feet more than their hands in games and in hunting; and\n the Cretans are greatly addicted to hunting, owing to which\n they are swift of foot. But there are people to be found who assert that Sicinnis\n is a word formed poetically from \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \n because in dancing it\n the Satyrs use most rapid movements; for this kind of dance gives no scope for a\n display of the passions, on which account also it is never slow. \n Now all satyric poetry formerly consisted of choruses, as also did tragedy, such\n as it existed at the same time; and that was the chief reason why tragedy had no\n regular actors. Arid there are three kinds of dance appropriate to dramatic\n poetry, \u2014the tragic, the comic, and the satyric; and in like manner, there are\n three kinds of lyric dancing,\u2014the pyrrhic the gymnop\u00e6dic, and the hyporchematic.\n And the pyrrhic dance resembles the satyric; for they both consist of rapid\n movements; but the pyrrhic appears to be a warlike kind of dance, for it is danced\n by armed boys. And men in war have need of swiftness to pursue their enemies, and\n also, when defeated, \n To flee, and not like madmen to stand firm, \n Nor be afraid to seem a short time cowards. \n But the dance called Gymnop\u00e6dica is like the dance in tragedy which is\n called Emmelea; for in each there is seen a degree of gravity and solemnity. But\n the hyporchematic dance is very nearly identical with the comic one which is\n called Cordax. And they are both a sportive kind of figure. \n ","28":"\n But Aristoxenus says that the Pyrrhic dance derives its name from Pyrrhichus, who\n was a Laced\u00e6monian by birth; and that even to this day Pyrrhichus is a\n Laced\u00e6monian name. And the dance itself, being of a warlike character, shows that\n it is the invention of some Laced\u00e6monian; for the Laced\u00e6monians are a martial\n race, and their sons learn military marches which they call \u1f10\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1. And the Laced\u00e6monians themselves in their wars recite the\n poems of Tyrt\u00e6us, and move in time to those airs. But Philochorus asserts that the\n Laced\u00e6monians, when owing to the generalship of Tyrt\u00e6us they had subdued the\n Messenians, introduced a regular custom in their expeditions, that whenever they\n were at supper, and had sung the p\u00e6an, they should also sing one of Tyrt\u00e6us's\n hymns as a solo, one after another; and that the polemarch should be the judge,\n and should give a piece of meat as a prize to him who sang best. But the Pyrrhic\n dance is not preserved now among any other people of Greece;\n and since that has fallen into disuse, their wars also have been brought to a\n conclusion; but it continues in use among the Laced\u00e6monians alone, being a sort of\n prelude preparatory to war: and all who are more than five years old in Sparta\n learn to dance the Pyrrhic dance. \n But the Pyrrhic dance as it exists in our time, appears to be a sort of Bacchic\n dance, and a little more pacific than the old one; for the dancers carry thyrsi\n instead of spears, and they point and dart canes at one another, and carry\n torches. And they dance in figures having reference to Bacchus, and to the\n Indians, and to the story of Pentheus: and they require for the Pyrrhic dance the\n most beautiful airs, and what are called the stirring tunes. \n ","29":"\n But the Gymnop\u00e6dica resembles the dance which by the ancients used to be called\n Anapale; for all the boys dance naked, performing some kind of movement in regular\n time, and with gestures of the hand like those used by wrestlers: so that the\n dancers exhibit a sort of spectacle akin to the palestra and to the pancratium,\n moving their feet in regular time. And the different modes of dancing it are\n called the Oschophoricus, and the Bacchic, so\n that this kind of dance, too, has some reference to Bacchus. But Aristoxenus says\n that the ancients, after they had exercised themselves in the Gymnop\u00e6dica, turned\n to the Pyrrhic dance before they entered the theatre: and the Pyrrhic dance is\n also called the Cheironomia. But the Hyporchematic dance is that in which the\n chorus dances while singing. Accordingly Bacchylides says\u2014 \n There's no room now for sitting down, \n There's no room for delay. \n And Pindar says\u2014 \n The Laced\u00e6monian troop of maidens fair. \n And the Laced\u00e6monians dance this dance in Pindar. And the Hyporchematica\n is a dance of men and women. Now the best modes are those which combine dancing\n with the singing; and they are these-the Prosodiacal, the Apostolical (which last\n is also called ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ), and others of the same\n kind. And some danced to the hymn and some did not; and some danced in\n accompaniment to hymns to Venus and Bacchus, and to the P\u00e6an, dancing at one time\n and resting at another. And among the barbarians as well as\n among the Greeks there are respectable dances and also indecorous ones. Now the\n Cordax among the Greeks is an indecorous dance, but the Emmelea is a respectable\n one: as is among the Arcadians the Cidaris, and among the Sicyonians the Aleter;\n and it is called Aleter also in Ithaca, as Aristoxenus relates in the first book\n of his History of Sicyon. And this appears enough to say at present on the subject\n of dances. \n ","30":"\n Now formerly decorum was carefully attended to in music, and everything in this\n art had its suitable and appropriate ornament: on which account there were\n separate flutes for each separate kind of harmony; and every flute-player had\n flutes adapted to each kind of harmony in their contests. But Pronomus the Theban\n was the first man who played the three different kinds of harmony already\n mentioned on the same flute. But now people meddle with music in a random and\n inconsiderate manner. And formerly, to be popular with the vulgar was reckoned a\n certain sign of a want of real skill: on which account Asopodorus the Phliasian,\n when some flute-player was once being much applauded while he himself was\n remaining in the hyposcenium, said\u2014 What is all this?\n the man has evidently committed some great blunder: \u2014as else he could\n not possibly have been so much approved of by the mob. But I am aware that some\n people tell this story as if it were Antigenides who said this. But in our days\n artists make the objects of their art to be the gaining the applause of the\n spectators in the theatre; on which account Aristoxenus, in his book entitled\n Promiscuous Banquets, says\u2014 We act in a manner similar to the people of\n P\u00e6stum who dwell in the Tyrrhenian Gulf; for it happened to them, though they\n were originally Greeks, to have become at last completely barbarised, becoming\n Tyrrhenians or Romans, and to have changed their language, and all the rest of\n their national habits. But one Greek festival they do celebrate even to the\n present day, in which they meet and recollect all their ancient names and\n customs, and bewail their loss to one another, and then, when they have wept\n for them, they go home. And so, says he, we also, since the\n theatres have become completely barbarised, and since music has become entirely\n ruined and vulgar, we, being but a few, will recal to our\n minds, sitting by ourselves, what music once was. And this was the\n discourse of Aristoxenus. \n ","31":"\n Wherefore it seems to me that we ought to have a philosophical conversation about\n music: for Pythgoras the Samian, who had such a high reputation as a philbsopher,\n is well known, from many circumstances, to have been a man who had no slight or\n superficial knowledge of music; for he indeed lays it down that the whole universe\n is put and kept together by music. And altogether the ancient philosophy of the\n Greeks appears to have been very much addicted to music; and on this account they\n judged Apollo to have been the most musical and the wisest of the gods, and\n Orpheus of' the demigods. And they called every one who devoted himself to the\n study of this art a sophist, as Aeschylus does in the verse where he says\u2014 \n And then the sophist sweetly struck the lyre. \n And that the ancients were excessively devoted to the study of music is\n plain from Homer, who, because all his own poetry was adapted to music, makes,\n from want of care, so many verses which are headless, and weak, and imperfect in\n the tail. But Xenophobes, and Solon, and Theognis, and Phocylides, and besides\n them Periander of Corinth, an elegiac poet, and the rest of those who did not set\n melodies to their poems, compose their verses with reference to number and to the\n arrangement of the metres, and take great care that none of their verses shall be\n liable to the charge of any of the irregularities which we just now imputed to\n Homer. Now when we call a verse headless ( \u1f00\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ), we mean such as have a mutilation or lameness at the\n beginning, such as\u2014 \n \n \n \n \u02bc\u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1f74 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u02bd\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\n \u1f35\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf. \n \n \n \n \u02bc\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03bf\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f36\u03c6\u03b9\n \u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf. \n \n \n Odyss. xii. 423. \n \n Those we call weak ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 ) which are\n defective in the middle, as\u2014 \n \n \u03b1\u1f36\u03c8\u03b1 \u03b4\u02bc \u1f04\u03c1\u02bc \u03b1\u1f30\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03c5\u1f31\u1f78\u03bd \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u02bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03bf. \n \n \n \n \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b4\u02bc \u03b1\u1f56\u03b8\u02bc \u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd \u02bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n \n Those again are \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, \n which are imperfect in the tail or end, as\u2014 \n \n \n \n \u03c4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u02bc \u1f10\u1fe4\u1fe5\u03af\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f45\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f34\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f34\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\n \u1f44\u03c6\u03b9\u03bd. \n \n \n Iliad, xii. 208. \n \n \n \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f74 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03c5\u1fd6\u03b1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd, \u1f10\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u03af\n \u1f24\u03ca\u03b1. \n \n \n Odyss. ix. 212. \n \n \n \n ","32":"\n But of all the Greeks, the Laced\u00e6monians were those who preserved the art of music\n most strictly, as they applied themselves to the practice a great deal: and there\n were a great many lyric poets among them. And even to this day they preserve their\n ancient songs carefully, being possessed of very varied and very accurate learning\n on the subject; on which account Pratinas says\u2014 \n The Laced\u00e6monian grasshopper sweetly sings, \n Well suited to the chorus. \n And on this account the poets also continually styled their odes\u2014 \n President of sweetest hymns: \n and\u2014 \n The honey-wing'd melodies of the Muse. \n For owing to the general moderation and austerity of their lives, they\n betook themselves gladly to music, which has a sort of power of soothing the\n understanding; so that it was natural enough that people who hear it should be\n delighted. And the people whom they called Choregi, were not, as Demetrius of\n Byzantium tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on Poetry, those who have\n that name now, the people, that is to say, who hire the choruses, but those who\n actually led the choruses, as the name intimates: and so it happened, that the\n Laced\u00e6monians were good musicians, and did not violate the ancient laws of\n music. \n Now in ancient times all the Greeks were fond of music; but when in subsequent\n ages disorders arose, when nearly all the ancient customs had got out of fashion\n and had become obsolete, this fondness for music also wore out, and bad styles of\n music were introduced, which led all the composers to aim at effeminacy rather\n than delicacy, and at an enervated and dissolute rather than a modest style. And\n perhaps this will still exist hereafter in a greater\n degree, and will extend still further, unless some one again draws forth the\n national music to the light. For formerly the subjects of their songs used to be\n the exploits of heroes, and the praises of the Gods; and accordingly Homer says of\n Achilles\u2014 \n \n \n With this he soothes his lofty soul, and sings \n Th' immortal deeds of heroes and of kings. \n \n Iliad, ix. 157. \n \n And of Phemius he says\u2014 \n \n \n Phemius, let acts of gods and heroes old, \n What ancient bards in hall and bower have told, \n Attemper'd to the lyre your voice employ, \n Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy. \n \n Odyss. i. 237. \n \n And this custom was preserved among the barbarians, as Dinon tells us in\n his history of Persia. Accordingly, the poets used to celebrate the valour of the\n elder Cyrus, and they foresaw the war which was going to be waged against\n Astyages. For when, says he, Cyrus had begun his march\n against the Persians, (and he had previously been the commander of the guards,\n and afterwards of the heavy-armed troops there, and then he left;) and while\n Astyages was sitting at a banquet with his friends, then a man, whose name was\n Angares, (and he was the most illustrious of his minstrels,) being called in,\n sang other things, such as were customary, and at last he said that\u2014 \n A mighty monster is let loose at last \n Into the marsh, fiercer than wildest boar; \n And when once master of the neighbouring ground \n It soon will fight with ease 'gainst numerous hosts. \n And when Astyages asked him what monster he meant, he Said\u2014' Cyrus the\n Persian.' And so the king, thinking that his suspicions were well founded, sent\n people to recal Cyrus, but did not succeed in doing so. \n \n ","33":"\n But I, though I could still say a good deal about music, yet, as I hear the noise\n of flutes, I will check my desire for talking, and only quote you the lines out of\n the Amateur of the Flute, by Philet\u00e6rus\u2014 \n O Jove, it were a happy thing to die \n While playing on the flute. For flute-players \n Are th' only men who in the shades below \n Feel the soft power and taste the bliss of Venus. \n But those whose coarser minds know nought of music, \n Pour water always into bottomless casks. \n \n \n \n After this there arose a discussion about the sambuca. And Masurius said that the\n sambuca was a musical instrument, very shrill, and that it was mentioned by\n Euphorion (who is also an Epic poet), in his book on the Isthmian Games; for he\n says that it was used by the Parthians and by the Troglodyt\u00e6, and that it had four\n strings. He said also that it was mentioned by Pythagoras, in his treatise on the\n Red Sea. The sambuca is also a name given to an engine used in sieges, the form\n and mechanism of which is explained by Biton, in his book addressed to Attalus on\n the subject of Military Engines. And Andreas of Panormus, in the thirty-third book\n of his History of Sicily, detailed city by city, says that it is borne against the\n walls of the enemy on two cranes. And it is called sambuca because when it is\n raised up it gives a sort of appearance of a ship and ladder joined together, and\n resembles the shape of the musical instrument of the same name. But Moschus, in\n the first book of his treatise on Mechanics, says that the sambuca is originally a\n Roman engine, and that Heraclides of Pontus was the original inventor of it. But\n Polybius, in the eighth book of his History, says,\u2014 Marcellus, having been a\n great deal inconvenienced at that siege of Syracuse by the contrivances of\n Archimedes, used to say that Archimedes had given his ships drink out of the\n sea; but that his sambuc\u00e6 had been buffeted and driven from the entertainment\n in disgrace. \n \n ","34":"\n And when, after this, Aemilianus said,\u2014But, my good friend Masurius, I myself,\n often, being a lover of music, turn my thoughts to the instrument which is called\n the magadis, and cannot decide whether I am to think that it was a species of\n flute or some kind of harp. For that sweetest of poets, Anacreon, says somewhere\n or other\u2014 \n I hold my magadis and sing, \n Striking loud the twentieth string, \n Leucaspis, as the rapid hour \n Leads you to youth's and beauty's flower. \n But Ion of Chios, in his Omphale, speaks of it as if it were a species of\n flute, in the following words\u2014 \n And let the Lydian flute, the magadis, \n Breathe its sweet sounds, and lead the tuneful song. \n And Aristarchus the grammarian, (a man whom Pan\u00e6tius the Rhodian\n philosopher used to call the Prophet, because he could so\n easily divine the meanings of poem ,) when explaining this verse, affirms that the\n magadis was a kind of flute: though Aristoxenus does not say so either in his\n treatise on the Flute-players or in that on Flutes and other Musical Instruments;\n nor does Archestratus either,\u2014and he also wrote two books on Flute-players; nor\n has Pyrrhander said so in his work on Flute-players; nor Phillis the Delian, \u2014for\n he also wrote a treatise on Flute-players and so did Euphranor. But Tryphon, in\n the second book of his essay on Names, speaks thus\u2014 The flute called\n magadis. And in another place he says\u2014\"The magadis gives a shrill and\n deep tone at the same time, as Anaxandrides inti- mates in his Man fighting in\n heavy Armour, were we find the line\u2014 \n I will speak to you like a magadis, \n In soft and powerful sounds at the same time. \n And, my dear Masurius, there is no one else except you who can solve this\n difficulty for me. \n ","35":"\n And Masurius replied\u2014Didymus the gramarian, in his work entitled Interpretations\n of the Plays of Ion different from the Interpretations of others, says, my good\n friend Aemilianus, that by the term \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 \n he understands the instrument which is also called \u03ba\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; which is mentioned by Aristoxenus in the first book\n of his treatise on the Boring of Flutes; for there he says that there are five\n kinds of flutes; the parthenius, the p\u00e6dicus, the citharisterius, the perfect, and\n the superperfect. And he says that Ion has omitted the conjunction \u03c4\u03b5 improperly, so that we are to understand by \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 the flute which accompanies the magadis;\n for the magadis is a stringed ( \u03c8\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd )\n instrument, as Anacreon tells us, and it was invented by the Lydians, on which\n account Ion, in his Omphale, calls the Lydian women \u03c8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, as playing on stringed instruments, in the following\n lines\u2014 \n But come, ye Lydian \u03c8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, and\n singing \n Your ancient hymns, do honour to this stranger. \n But Theophilus the comic poet, in his Neoptolemus, calls playing on the\n magadis \u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, saying\u2014 \n It may be that a worthless son may sing \n His father or his mother on the magadis ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ), \n \n Sitting upon the wheel; but none of us \n Shall ever play such music now as theirs. \n And Euphorion, in his treatise on the Isthmian Games, says, that the\n magadis is an ancient instrument, but that in latter times it was altered, and had\n the name also changed to that of the sambuca. And, that this instrument was very\n much used at Mitylene, so that one of the Muses was represented by an old\n statuary, whose name was Lesbothemis, as holding one in her hand. But Men\u00e6chmus,\n in his treatise on Artists, says that the \u03c0\u03b7\u03ba\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2, \n which he calls identical with the magadis, was invented by Sappho. And Aristoxenus\n says that the magadis and the pectis were both played with the fingers without any\n plectrum; on which account Pindar, in his Scolium addressed to Hiero, having named\n the magadis, calls it a responsive harping ( \u03c8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd\n \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c6\u03b8\u03bf\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd ), because its music is accompanied in all its keys by two\n kinds of singers, namely, men and boys. And Phrynichus, in his Ph\u0153nician Women,\n has said\u2014 \n Singing responsive songs on tuneful harps. \n And Sophocles, in his Mysians, says\u2014 \n There sounded too the Phrygian triangle, \n With oft-repeated notes; to which responded \n The well-struck strings of the soft Lydian pectis. \n \n \n ","36":"\n But some people raise a question how, as the magadis did not exist in the time of\n Anacreon (for instruments with many strings were never seen till after his time),\n Anacreon can possibly mention it, as he does when he says\u2014 \n I hold my magadis and sing, \n Striking loud the twentieth string, \n Leucaspis. \n But Posidonius asserts that Anacreon mentions three kinds of melodies,\n the Phrygian, the Dorian, and the Lydian; for that these were the only melodies\n with which he was acquainted. And as every one of these is executed on seven\n strings, he says that it was very nearly correct of Anacreon to speak of twenty\n strings, as he only omits one for the sake of speaking in round numbers. But\n Posidonius is ignorant that the magadis is an ancient instrument, though Pindar\n says plainly enough that Terpander invented the barbitos to correspond to, and\n answer the pectis in use among the Lydians\u2014 \n \n The sweet responsive lyre \n Which long ago the Lesbian bard, \n Terpander, did invent, sweet ornament \n To the luxurious Lydian feasts, when he \n Heard the high-toned pectis. \n Now the pectis and the magadis are the same instrument, as Aristoxenus\n tells us, and Menechmus the Sicyonian too, in his treatise on Artists. And this\n last author says that Sappho, who is more ancient than Anacreon, was the first\n person to use the pectis. Now, that Terpander is more ancient than Anacreon, is\n evident from the following considerations:\u2014Terpander was the first man who ever\n got the victory at the Carnean games, as Hellanicus tells us in the verses in which he has celebrated the\n victors at the Carnea, and also in the formal catalogue which he gives us of them.\n But the first establishment of the Carnea took place in the twenty-sixth Olympiad,\n as Sosibius tells us in his essay on Dates. But Hieronymus, in his treatise on\n Harp-players, which is the subject of the fifth of his Treatises on Poets, says\n that Terpander was a contemporary of Lycurgus the law-giver, who, it is agreed by\n all men, was, with Iphitus of Elis, the author of that establishment of the\n Olympic games from which the first Olympiad is reckoned. But Euphorion, in his\n treatise on the Isthmian Games, says that the instruments with many strings are\n altered only in their names; but that the use of them is very ancient. \n ","37":"\n However, Diogenes the tragic poet represents the pectis as differing from the\n magadis; for in the Semele he says\u2014 \n And now I hear the turban-wearing women, \n Votaries of th' Asiatic Cybele, \n The wealthy Phrygians' daughters, loudly sounding \n With drums, and rhombs, and brazen-clashing cymbals, \n Their hands in concert striking on each other, \n Pour forth a wise and healing hymn to the gods. \n Likewise the Lydian and the Bactrian maids \n Who dwell beside the Halys, loudly worship \n The Tmolian goddess Artemis, who loves \n \n The laurel shade of the thick leafy grove, \n Striking the clear three-corner'd pectis, and \n Raising responsive airs upon the magadis, \n While flutes in Persian manner neatly join'd \n Accompany the chorus. \n And Phillis the Delian, in the second book of his treatise on Music, also\n asserts that the pectis is different from the magadis. And his words are\n these\u2014 There are the ph\u0153nices, the pectides, the magadides, the sambuc\u00e6,\n the iambic\u00e6, the triangles, the clepsiambi, the scindapsi, the\n nine-string. For, he says that the lyre to which they sang\n iambics, they called the iambyca, and the instrument to which they sang them in\n such a manner as to vary the metre a little, they called the clepsiambus, while the magadis\n was an instrument uttering a diapason sound, and equally in tune for every\n portion of the singers. And besides these there were instruments of other kinds\n also; for there was the barbitos, or barmus, and many others, some with\n strings, and some with sounding-boards. \n \n ","38":"\n There were also some instruments besides those which were blown into, and those\n which were used with different strings, which gave forth only sounds of a simple\n nature, such as the castanets ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 ), which\n are mentioned by Dic\u00e6archus, in his essay on the Manners and Customs of Greece,\n where he says, that formerly certain instruments were in very frequent use, in\n order to accompany women while dancing and singing; and when any one touched these\n instruments with their fingers they uttered a shrill sound. And he says that this\n is plainly shown in the hymn to Diana, which begins thus\u2014 \n Diana, now my mind will have me utter \n A pleasing song in honour of your deity, \n While this my comrade strikes with nimble hand \n The well-gilt brazen-sounding castanets. \n And Hermippus, in his play called The Gods, gives the word for rattling\n the castanets, \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, saying\u2014 \n And beating down the limpets from the rocks, \n They make a noise like castanets ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9 ). \n But Didymus says, that some people, instead of the lyre, are in the habit\n of striking oyster-shells and cockle-shells against one\n another, and by these means contrive to play a tune in time to the dancers, as\n Aristophanes also intimates in his Frogs. \n \n ","39":"\n But Artemon, in the first book of his treatise on the Dionysian System, as he\n calls it, says that Timotheus the Milesian appears to many men to have used an\n instrument of more strings than were necessary, namely, the magadis, on which\n account he was chastised by the Laced\u00e6monians as having corrupted the ancient\n music. And when some one was going to cut away the superfluous strings from his\n lyre, he showed them a little statue of Apollo which they had, which held in its\n hand a lyre with an equal number of strings, and which was tuned in the same\n manner; and so he was acquitted. But Douris, in his treatise on Tragedy, says that\n the magadis was named after Magodis, who was a Thracian by birth. But Apollodorus,\n in his Reply to the Letter of Aristocles, says\u2014 That which we now call\n \u03c8\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd is the same instrument which was\n formerly called magadis; but that which used to be called the clepsiambus, and\n the triangle, and the elymus, and the nine-string, have fallen into comparative\n disuse. And Alcman says\u2014 \n And put away the magadis. \n And Sophocles, in his Thamyras, says\u2014 \n And well-compacted lyres and magadides, \n And other highly-polish'd instruments, \n From which the Greeks do wake the sweetest sounds. \n But Telestes, in his dithyrambic poem, called Hymen\u00e6us, says that the\n magadis was an instrument with five strings, using the following expressions\u2014\n \n And each a different strain awakens,\u2014 \n One struck the loud horn-sounding magadis, \n And in the fivefold number of tight strings \n Moved his hand to and fro most rapidly. \n I am acquainted, too, with another instrument which the Thracian kings\n use in their banquets, as Nicomedes tells us in his essay on Orpheus. Now Ephorus\n and Scarmon, in their treatise on Inventions, say that the instrument called the\n Phoenix derives its name from having been invented by the\n Ph\u0153nicians. But Semus of Delos, in the first book of the Delias, says that it is\n so called because its ribs are made of the palm-tree which grows in Delos. The\n same writer, Semus, says that the first person who used the sambuca was Sibylla,\n and that the instrument derives its name from having been invented by a man named\n Sambyx. \n ","40":"\n And concerning the instrument called the tripod (this also is a musical\n instrument) the before-mentioned Artemo writes as follows\u2014 And that is how\n it is that there are many instruments, as to which it is even uncertain whether\n they ever existed; as, for instance, the tripod of Pythagoras of Zacynthus. For\n as it was in fashion but a very short time, and as, either because the\n fingering of it appeared exceedingly difficult, or for some other reason, it\n was very soon disused, it has escaped the notice of most writers altogether.\n But the instrument was in form very like the Delphian tripod, and it derived\n its name from it; but it was used like a triple harp. For its feet stood on\n some pedestal which admitted of being easily turned round, just as the legs of\n movable chairs are made; and along the three intermediate spaces between the\n feet, strings were stretched; an arm being placed above each, and tuning-pegs,\n to which the strings were attached, below. And on the top there was the usual\n ornament of the vase, and of some other ornaments which were attached to it;\n all which gave it a very elegant appearance; and it emitted a very powerful\n sound. And Pythagoras divided the three harmonies with reference to three\n countries,\u2014the Dorian, the Lydian, and Phrygian. And he himself sitting on a\n chair made on the same principles and after the same pattern, putting out his\n left hand so as to take hold of the instrument, and using the plectrum in his\n other hand, moved the pedestal with his foot very easily, so as to use\n whichever side of the instrument he chose to begin with; and then again turning\n to the other side he went on playing, and then he changed to the third side.\n And so rapidly did the easy movement of the pedestal, when touched by the foot,\n bring the various sides under his hand, and so very rapid was his fingering and\n execution, that if a person had not seen what was being done, but had judged\n only by his ear, he would have fancied that he was listening to three\n harp-players all playing on different instruments. But\n this instrument, though it was so greatly admired, after his death rapidly fell\n into disuse. \n \n ","41":"\n Now the system of playing the harp without any vocal accompaniment, was, as\n Menechmus informs us, first introduced by Aristonicus the Argive, who was a\n contemporary of Archilochus, and lived in Corcyra. But Philochorus, in the third\n book of his Atthis, says\u2014-\" Lysander the Sicyonian harp-player was the first\n person who ever changed the art of pure instrumental performance, dwelling on the\n long tones, and producing a very rich sound, and adding also to the harp the music\n of the flute; and this last addition was first introduced by Epigonus; and taking\n away the jejuneness which existed in the music of those who played the harp alone\n without any vocal accompaniment, he first introduced various beautiful\n modifications on that instrument; and he played on the different kinds of harp called\n iambus and magadis, which is also called \u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2. \n And he was the first person who ever attempted to change his instrument while\n playing. And afterwards, adding dignity to the business, he was the first person\n to institute a chorus. And Men\u00e6chmus says that Dion of Chius was the first person\n who ever played on the harp an ode such as is used at libations to the honour of\n Bacchus. But Timomachus, in his History of Cyprus, says that Stesander the Samian\n added further improvements to his art, and was the first person who at Delphi sang\n to his lyre the battles narrated in Homer, beginning with the Odyssey. But others\n say that the first person who ever played amatory strains on his harp was Amiton\n the Eleuthern\u00e6an, who did so in his own city, whose descendants are all called\n Amitores. \n But Aristoxenus says that just as some men have composed parodies on hexameter\n verses, for the sake of exciting a laugh; so, too, others\n have parodied the verses which were sung to the harp, in which pastime \u0152nopas led\n the way. And he was imitated by Polyeuctus the Ach\u00e6an, and by Diodes of Cyn\u00e6tha.\n There have also been poets who have composed a low kind of poems, concerning whom\n Ph\u00e6nias the Eresian speaks in his writings addressed to the Sophists; where he\n writes thus:\u2014 Telenicus the Byzantian, and also Argas, being both authors of\n low poems, were men who, as far as that kind of poetry could go, were accounted\n clever. But they never even attempted to rival the songs of Terpander or\n Phrynis. And Alexis mentions Argas, in his Man Disembarked, thus\u2014\n \n \n A. Here is a poet who has gained the prize \n In choruses. \n \n B. What is his style of poetry? \n \n A. A noble kind. \n \n B. How will he stand comparison \n With Argas \n \n A. He's a whole day's journey better. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Hercules, says\u2014 \n For he appears a really clever man. \n How gracefully he takes the instrument, \n Then plays at once. . . . . \n When I have eaten my fill, I then incline \n To send you off to sing a match with Argas, \n That you, my friend, may thus the sophists conquer. \n \n \n ","42":"\n But the author of the play called the Beggars, which is attributed to Chionides,\n mentions a certain man of the name of Gnesippus as a composer of ludicrous verses,\n and also of merry songs; and he says\u2014 \n I swear that neither now Gnesippus, nor \n Cleomenes with all his nine-string'd lyre, \n Could e'er have made this song endurable. \n And the author of the Helots says\u2014 \n He is a man who sings the ancient songs \n Of Alcman, and Stesichorus, and Simonides; \n (he means to say Gnesippus): \n He likewise has composed songs for the night, \n Well suited to adulterers, with which \n They charm the women from their doors, while striking \n The shrill iambyca or the triangle. \n And Cratinus, in his Effeminate Persons, says\u2014 \n Who, O Gnesippus, e'er saw me in love \n I am indignant; for I do think nothing \n Can be so vain or foolish as a lover. \n \n . . . . . . .and he ridicules him for his poems; and in his\n Herdsmen he says\u2014 \n A man who would not give to Sophocles \n A chorus when he asked one; though he granted \n That favour to Cleomachus, whom I \n Should scarce think worthy of so great an honour, \n At the Adonia. \n And in his Hours he says\u2014 \n Farewell to that great tragedian \n Cleomachus, with his chorus of hair-pullers, \n Plucking vile melodies in the Lydian fashion. \n But Teleclides, in his Rigid Men, says that he was greatly addicted to\n adultery. And Clearchus, in the second book of his Amatory Anecdotes, says that\n the love-songs, and those, too, which are called the Locrian songs, do not differ\n in the least from the compositions of Sappho and Anacreon. Moreover, the poems of\n Archilochus, and that on fieldfares, attributed to Homer, relate to some division\n or other of this passion, describing it in metrical poetry. But the writings of\n Asopodorus about love, and the whole body of amorous epistles, are a sort of\n amatory poetry out of metre. \n ","43":"\n When Masurius had said this, the second course, as it is called, was served up to\n us; which, indeed, was very often offered to us, not only on the days of the\n festival of Saturn, when it is\n the custom of the Romans to feast their slaves, while they themselves discharge\n the offices of their slaves. But this is in reality a Grecian custom. At all\n events, in Crete, at the festival of Mercury, a similar thing takes place, as\n Carystius tells us in his Historic Reminiscences; for then, while the slaves are\n feasting, the masters wait upon them as if they were the servants: and so they do\n at Tr\u0153zen in the month Ger\u00e6stius. For then there is a festival which lasts for\n many days, on one of which the slaves play at dice in common with the citizens,\n and the masters give a banquet to the slaves, as Carystius himself tells us. And\n Berosus, in the first book of his History of Babylon, says that on the sixteenth\n day of the month Lous, there is a great festival celebrated in Babylon, which is called Sakeas; and it lasts five days: and during those days\n it is the custom for the masters to be under the orders of their slaves; and one\n of the slaves puts on a robe like the king's, which is called a zoganes, and is\n master of the house. And Ctesias also mentions this festival in the second book of\n his History of Persia. But the Coans act in an exactly contrary manner, as\n Macareus tells us in the third book of his History of Cos. For when they sacrifice\n to Juno, the slaves do not come to the entertainment; on which account Phylarchus\n says\u2014 \n Among the Sourii, the freemen only \n Assist at the holy sacrifice; none else \n The temples or the altars dare approach; \n And no slave may come near the sacred precincts. \n \n \n ","44":"\n But Baton of Sinope, the orator, in his treatise on Thessaly and H\u00e6monica,\n distinctly asserts that the Roman Saturnalia are originally a very Greek festival,\n saying that among the Thessalians it is called Peloria. And these are his\n words:\u2014 When a common festival was being celebrated by all the Pelasgi, a\n man whose name was Pelorus brought news to Pelasgus that there had been some\n violent earthquakes in H\u00e6monia, by which the mountains called Tempe had been\n rent asunder, and that the water of the lake had burst through the rent, and\n was all falling into the stream of the Peneus; and that all the country which\n had formerly been covered by the lake was now laid open, and that, as the\n waters were now drained off, there were plains visible of wondrous size and\n beauty. Accordingly, Pelasgus, on hearing this statement, had a table loaded\n with every delicacy set before Pelorus; and every one else received him with\n great cordiality, and brought whatever they had that was best, and placed it on\n the table before the man who had brought this news; and Pelasgus himself waited\n on him with great cheerfulness, and all the rest of the nobles obeyed him as\n his servants as often as any opportunity offered. On which account, they say\n that after the Pelasgi occupied the district, they instituted a festival as a\n sort of imitation of the feast which took place on that occasion; and,\n sacrificing to Jupiter Pelor, they serve up tables admirably furnished, and\n hold a very cordial and friendly assembly, so as to receive every foreigner at\n the banquet, and to set free all the prisoners, and to make their servants sit\n down and feast with every sort of liberty and licence,\n while their masters wait on them. And, in short, even to this day the\n Thessalians celebrate this as their chief festival, and call it\n Peloria. \n \n ","45":"\n Very often, then, as I have said, when such a dessert as this is set before us,\n some one of the guests who were present would say\u2014 \n Certainly, second thoughts are much the best; \n For what now can the table want? or what \n Is there with which it is not amply loaded? \n 'Tis full of fish fresh from the sea, besides \n Here's tender veal, and dainty dishes of goose, \n Tartlets, and cheesecakes steep'd most thoroughly \n In the rich honey of the golden bee; \n as Euripides says in his Cretan Women: and, as Eubulus said in his Rich\n Woman\u2014 \n And in the same way everything is sold \n Together at Athens; figs and constables, \n Grapes, turnips, pears and apples, witnesses, \n Roses and medlars, cheesecakes, honeycombs, \n Vetches and law-suits; bee-strings of all kinds, \n And myrtle-berries, and lots for offices, \n Hyacinths, and lambs, and hour-glasses too, \n And laws and prosecutions. \n Accordingly, when Pontianus was about to say something about each of the\n dishes of the second course,\u2014We will not, said Ulpian, hear you discuss these\n things until you have spoken about the sweetmeats ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ). And Pontianus replied:\u2014Cratinus says that\n Philippides has given this name to the \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \n in his Miser, where he says\u2014 \n Cheesecakes, \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, and eggs, \n And sesame; and were I to endeavour \n To count up every dish, the day would fail me. \n And Diphilus, in his Telesias, says\u2014 \n \n \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1, myrtle-berries, cheesecakes\n too, \n And almonds; so that with the greatest pleasure \n I eat the second course ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 ). \n And Sophilus, in his Deposit, says\u2014 \n 'Tis always pleasant supping with the Greeks; \n They manage well; with them no one cries out\u2014 \n Here, bring a stronger draught; for I must feast \n With the Tanagrian; that there, lying down, \n * * * * * \n And Plato, in his Atlanticus, calls these sweetmeats \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1; saying\u2014 And at that time the earth\n used to produce all sorts of sweet-smelling things for its inhabitants; and a\n great deal of cultivated fruit, and a great variety of\n nuts; and all the \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 which give\n pleasure when eaten. \n \n ","46":"\n But Tryphon says that formerly before the guests entered the supper-room, each\n person's share was placed on the table, and that afterwards a great many dishes of\n various kinds were served up in addition; and that on this account these latter\n dishes were called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. But Philyllius, in\n his Well-digger, speaking of the second course, says\u2014 \n Almonds, and nuts, and \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n \n And Archippus, in his Hercules, and Herodotus, in the first book of his\n History, have both used the verb \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for\n eating after supper. And Archippus also, in his Hercules Marrying, uses the word\n \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; where he says\u2014 \n The board was loaded with rich honey-cakes \n And other \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n \n And Herodotus, in the first book of his History, says\u2014 They do not\n eat a great deal of meat, but a great many \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n But as for the proverbial saying, The \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 of Abydos, that is a kind of tax and\n harbour-due; as is explained by Aristides in the third book of his treatise on\n Proverbs. But Dionysius, the son of Tryphon, says\u2014 Formerly, before the\n guests came into the banqueting-room, the portion for each individual was\n placed on the table, and afterwards a great many other things were served up in\n addition ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 ); from which custom they\n were called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n And Philyllius, in his Well-digger, speaks of what is brought in after\n the main part of the banquet is over, saying\u2014 \n Almonds, and nuts, and \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. \n \n But Plato the comic poet, in the Menelaus, calls them \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, as being for eatables placed on the\n table ( \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03b6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 ), saying\u2014 \n \n A. Come, tell me now, \n Why are so few of the \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \n \n Remaining? \n \n B. That man hated by the gods \n Ate them all up. \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says that sweetmeats\n ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ) used to be called by the ancients\n \u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1; for that they come in as a sort of\n second course. But it is Pindar who said\u2014 \n And \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd is nice when supper's over, \n And when the guests have eaten plentifully. \n \n And he was quite right. For Euripides says, when one looks\n on what is served up before one, one may really say\u2014 \n You see how happily life passes when \n A man has always a well-appointed table. \n \n \n ","47":"\n And that among the ancients the second course used to have a great deal of expense\n and pains bestowed on it, we may learn from what Pindar says in his Olympic Odes,\n where he speaks of the flesh of Pelops being served up for food:\u2014 \n \n \n And in the second course they carved \n Your miserable limbs, and feasted on them; \n But far from me shall be the thought profane, \n That in foul feast celestials could delight. \n \n Pind. Ol. i. 80 \n \n And the ancients often called this second course simply \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1\u03b9, as, for instance, Ach\u00e6us in his Vulcan, which\n is a satyric drama, who says,\u2014 \n \n A. First we will gratify you with a feast; \n Lo! here it is. \n \n B. But after that what means \n Of pleasure will you offer me? \n \n A. We'll anoint you \n All over with a richly-smelling perfume. \n \n B. Will you not give me first a jug of water \n To wash my hands with! \n \n A. Surely; the dessert ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 ) \n Is now being clear'd away. \n And Aristophanes, in his Wasps, says\u2014 \n \n \n Bring water for the hands; clear the dessert. \n \n Ar. Vesp\u00e6, 121 \n \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drunkenness, uses the term \u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1\u03b9, much as we do now; saying,\u2014 We\n must therefore bear in mind that there is a difference between \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 and \u03b2\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1, as\n there is also between \u1f14\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. For this is a national name in use in\n every part of Greece, since there is food ( \u03b2\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 ) in sweetmeats ( \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9 ), from which consideration the man who, first used the\n expression \u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1, , appears to have\n spoken with sufficient correctness. For the eating of sweetmeats ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 ) is really an eating after supper\n ( \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 ); and the sweetmeats are\n served up as a second supper. But Dic\u00e6archus, in the first book of his\n Descent to the Cave of Trophonius, speaks thus: There was also the \u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1, which was a very expensive part of a\n banquet, and there were also garlands, and perfumes, and burnt frankincense,\n and all the other necessary accompaniments of these thing. \n \n \n ","48":"\n Eggs too often formed a part of the second course, as did hares and thrushes,\n which were served up with the honey-cakes; as we find mentioned by Antiphanes in\n the Leptiniscus, where he says,\u2014 \n \n A. Would you drink Thasian wine? \n \n B. No doubt, if any one \n Fills me a goblet with it. \n \n A. Then what think you \n Of almonds? \n \n B. I feel very friendly to them, \n They mingle well with honey. \n \n A. If a man \n Should bring you honied cheesecakes? \n \n B. I should eat them, \n And swallow down an egg or two besides. \n And in his Things resembling one another, he says,\u2014 \n Then he introduced a dance, and after that he served up \n A second course, provided well with every kind of dainty. \n And Amphis, in his Gyn\u00e6comania, says,\u2014 \n \n A. Did you e'er hear of what they call a ground life? \n . . . . . . . . 'tis clearly \n Cheesecakes, sweet wine, eggs, cakes of sesame, \n Perfumes, and crowns, and female flute-players. \n \n B. Castor and Pollux! why you have gone through \n The names of all the dozen gods at once. \n Anaxandrides, in his Clowns, says,\u2014 \n And when I had my garland on my head, \n They brought in the dessert ( \u1f21 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 ), in\n which there were \n So many dishes, that, by all the gods, \n And goddesses too, I hadn't the least idea \n There were so many different things i' th' house; \n And never did I live so well as then. \n Clearchus says in his Pandrosus,\u2014 \n \n A. Have water for your hands: \n \n B. By no means, thank you; \n I'm very comfortable as I am. \n \n A. Pray have some; \n You'll be no worse at all events. Boy, water! \n And put some nuts and sweetmeats on the table. \n And Eubulus, in his Campylion, says,\u2014 \n \n A. Now is your table loaded well with\n sweetmeats. \n \n B. I am not always very fond of sweetmeats. \n Alexis, too, says in his Polyclea, (Polyclea was the name of a\n courtesan,)\u2014 \n \n He was a clever man who first invented \n The use of sweetmeats; for he added thus \n A pleasant lengthening to the feast, and saved men \n From unfill'd mouths and idle jaws unoccupied. \n And in his Female Likeness (but this same play is attributed also to\n Antidotus) he says,\u2014 \n \n A. I am not one, by Aesculapius! \n To care excessively about my supper; \n I'm fonder of dessert. \n \n B. 'Tis very well. \n \n A. For I do hear that sweetmeats are in fashion, \n For suitors when they're following . . . \n \n B. Their brides,\u2014 \n \n A. To give them cheesecakes, hares, and thrushes\n too, \n These are the things I like; but pickled fish \n And soups and sauces I can't bear, ye gods! \n But Apion and Diodorus, as Pamphilus tells us, assert that the sweetmeats\n brought in after supper are also called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n ","49":"\n Ephippus, in his Ephebi, enumerating the different dishes in fashion for dessert,\n says,\u2014 \n Then there were brought some groats, some rich perfumes \n From Egypt, and a cask of rich palm wine \n Was broach'd. Then cakes and other kinds of sweetmeats, \n Cheesecakes of every sort and every name; \n And a whole hecatomb of eggs. These things \n We ate, and clear'd the table vigorously, \n For we did e'en devour some parasites. \n And in his Cydon he says,\u2014 \n And after supper they served up some kernels, \n Vetches, and beans, and groats, and cheese, and honey, \n Sweetmeats of various kinds, and cakes of sesame, \n And pyramidical rolls of wheat, and apples, \n Nuts, milk, hempseed too, and shell-fish, \n Syrup, the brains of Jove. \n Alexis too, in his Philiscus, says,\u2014 \n Now is the time to clear the table, and \n To bring each guest some water for his hands, \n And garlands, perfumes, and libations, \n Frankincense, and a chafing-dish. Now give \n Some sweetmeats, and let all some cheesecakes have. \n And as Philoxenus of Cythera, in his Banquet, where he mentions the\n second course, has spoken by name of many of the dishes which are served up to us,\n we may as well cite his words:\u2014 \n \n And the beautiful vessels which come in first, were brought in again full\n of every kind of delicacy, which mortals call \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1\u03b9, but the Gods call them the Horn of\n Amalthea. And in the middle was placed that great delight of mortals, white\n marrow dressed sweet; covering its face with a thin membrane, like a spider's\n web, out of modesty, that one might not see . . . . . in the dry nets of\n Arist\u00e6us . . . . And its name was amyllus . . . . . . . . . . which they call\n Jupiter's sweetmeats . . . . Then he distributed plates of . . . . very\n delicious . . . . . . and a cheesecake compounded of cheese, and milk, and\n honey . . . almonds with soft rind . . . . and nuts, which boys are very fond\n of; and everything else which could be expected in plentiful and costly\n entertainment. And drinking went on, and playing at the cottabus, and\n conversation . . . . . . . It was pronounced a very magnificent entertainment,\n and every one admired and praised it. \n \n This, then, is the description given by Philoxenus of Cythera, whom Antiphanes\n praises in his Third-rate Performer, where he says\u2014 \n Philoxenus now does surpass by far \n All other poets. First of all he everywhere \n Uses new words peculiar to himself; \n And then how cleverly doth he mix his melodies \n With every kind of change and modification! \n Surely he is a god among weak men, \n And a most thorough judge of music too, \n But poets of the present day patch up \n Phrases of ivy and fountains into verse, \n And borrow old expressions, talking of \n Melodies flying on the wings of flowers, \n And interweave them with their own poor stuff. \n \n \n ","50":"\n There are many writers who have given lists of the different kinds of cheesecakes,\n and as far as I can recollect, I will mention them, and what they have said. I\n know, too, that Callimachus, in his List of Various Books, mentions the treatises\n on the Art of Making Cheesecakes, written by Aegimius, and Hegesippus, and\n Metrobius, and also by Ph\u00e6tus. But I will communicate to you the names of\n cheesecakes which I myself have been able to find to put down, not treating you as\n Socrates was treated in the matter of the cheesecake which was sent to him by\n Alcibiades; for Xanthippe took it and trampled upon it, on which Socrates laughed,\n and said, At all events you will not have any of it yourself. (This\n story is related by Antipater, in the first book of his essay on Passion.) But I,\n as I am fond of cheesecakes, should have been very sorry to see that divine\n cheesecake so injuriously treated. Accordingly, Plato the\n comic poet ren- tions cheesecakes in his play called The Poet, where he says\u2014\n \n Am I alone to sacrifice without \n Having a taste allow'd me of the entrails, \n Without a cheesecake, without frankincense? \n \n \n Nor do I forget that there is a village, which Demetrius the Scepsian, in the\n twelfth book of his Trojan Array, tells us bears the name of \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (cheesecake); and he says that it is six stadia from\n Hypoplacian Thebes. \n \n Now, the word \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 ought to have a circumflex\n in the nominative case; for it is contracted from \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, as \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 is from \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, and \u03c3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \n from \u03c3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. . And it is used as a substantive,\n the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (bread) being understood. \n Those who have lived in the place assure us that there are capital cheesecakes to\n be got at Parium on the Hellespont; for it is a blunder of Alexis, when he speaks\n of them as coming from the island of Paros. And this is what he says in his play\n called Archilochus:\u2014 \n Happy old man, who in the sea-girt isle \n Of happy Paros dwell'st\u2014a land which bears \n Two things in high perfection; marble white, \n Fit decoration for th' immortal gods, \n And cheesecakes, dainty food for mortal men. \n And Sopater the farce-writer, in his Suitors of Bacchis, testifies that\n the cheesecakes of Samos are extraordinarily good; saying,\u2014 \n The cheesecake-making island named Samos. \n \n \n ","51":"\n Menander, in his False Hercules, speaks of cheesecakes made in a mould:\u2014 \n It is not now a question about candyli, \n Or all the other things which you are used \n To mix together in one dish-eggs, honey, \n And similago; for all these things now \n Are out of place. The cook at present's making \n Baked cheesecakes in a mould; and boiling groats \n To serve up after the salt-fish,\u2014and grapes, \n And forced-meat wrapp'd in fig-leaves. And the maid, \n Who makes the sweetmeats and the common cheesecakes, \n Is roasting joints of meat and plates of thrushes. \n And Evangelus, in his Newly-married Woman, says\u2014 \n \n A. Four tables did I mention to you of women, \n And six of men; a supper, too, complete\u2014 \n In no one single thing deficient; \n \n Wishing the marriage-feast to be a splendid one. \n \n B. Ask no one else; I will myself go round, \n Provide for everything, and report to you. \n . . . . . As many kinds of olives as you please; \n For meat, you've veal, and sucking-pig, and pork, \n And hares\u2014 \n \n A. Hear how this cursed fellow boasts! \n \n B. Forced-meat in fig-leaves, cheese, cheesecakes in\n moulds- \n \n A. Here, Dromo! \n \n B. Candyli, eggs, cakes of meal. \n And then the table is three cubits high; \n So that all those who sit around must rise \n Whene'er they wish to help themselves to anything, \n There was a kind of cheesecake called \u1f04\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2. Antiphanes enumerates \n \n \u1f04\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9; \n \n and Menander, in his Supposititious Son, says\u2014 \n You would be glad were any one to dress \n A cheesecake ( \u1f04\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 ) for you. \n But the Ionians, as Seleucus tells us in his Dialects, make the\n accusative case \u1f04\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd; and they call small\n cheesecakes of the same kind \u1f00\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9. Teleclides\n says\u2014 \n Thrushes flew of their own accord \n Right down my throat with savoury \u1f00\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n \n \n ","52":"\n There was also a kind called \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd :\u2014 \n He was so greedy that he ate a whole \n Diaconium up, besides an amphiphon. \n But the \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd was a kind of cheesecake\n consecrated to Diana, having figures of lighted torches round it. Philemon, in his\n Beggar, or Woman of Rhodes, says\u2014 \n Diana, mistress dear, I bring you now \n This amphiphon, and these libations holy. \n Diphilus also mentions it in his Hecate. Philochorus also mentions the\n fact of its being called \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd, and of its being\n brought into the temples of Diana, and also to the places where three roads meet,\n on the day when the moon is overtaken at its setting by the rising of the sun; and\n so the heaven is \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, or all over light. \n There is the basynias too. Semus, in the second book of the Deliad, says\u2014 In\n the island of Hecate, the Delians sacrifice to Iris, offering her the\n cheesecakes called basyni\u00e6; and this is a cake of wheat-flour, and suet, and\n honey, boiled up together: and what is called \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 consists of a fig and three nuts. \n \n There are also cheesecakes called strepti and ne\u00eblata. Both; \n these kinds are mentioned by Demosthenes the orator, in his Speech in Defence of\n Ctesiphon concerning the Crown. \n There are also epichyta. Nicochares, in his Handicraftsmen, says\u2014 \n I've loaves, and barley-cakes, and bran, and flour, \n And rolls, obelias, and honey'd cheesecakes, \n Epichyti, ptisan, and common cheesecakes, \n Dendalides, and fried bread. \n But Pamphilus says that the \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is\n the same kind of cheesecake as that which is called \u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2. And Hipponax mentions the \u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 in the following lines:\u2014 \n Not eating hares or woodcocks, \n Nor mingling small fried loaves with cakes of sesame, \n Nor dipping attanite in honeycombs, \n \n \n There is also the cre\u00efum. This is a kind of cheesecakes which, at Argos, is\n brought to the bridegroom from the bride; and it is roasted on the coals, and the\n friends of the bride- groom are invited to eat it; and it is served up with honey,\n as Philetas tells us in his Miscellanies. \n There is also the glycinas: this is a cheesecake in fashion among the Cretans,\n made with sweet wine and oil, as Seleucus tells us in his Dialects. \n There is also the empeptas. The same author speaks of this as a cheesecake made of\n wheat, hollow and well-shaped, like those which are called \u03ba\u03c1\u03b7\u03c0\u1fd6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2; being rather a kind of paste into which they put those\n cheesecakes which are really made with cheese. \n ","53":"\n There are cakes, also, called \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. These are\n cakes boiled in oil, and after that seasoned with honey; and they are mentioned by\n Stesichorus in the following lines:\u2014 \n Groats and encrides, \n And other cakes, and fresh sweet honey. \n Epicharmus, too, mentions them; and so does Nicophon, in his\n Handicraftsmen. And Aristophanes, in his Danaides, speaks of a man who made them\n in the following words:\u2014 \n And not be a seller of encrides ( \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 ). \n And Pherecrates, in his Crapatalli, says\u2014 \n Let him take this, and then along the road \n Let him seize some encrides. \n \n \n There is the \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, too. This is a kind of\n cheesecake in use among the Syracusans, under this name; and it is mentioned by\n Epicharmus, in his Earth and Sea. \n \n There is also the \u03b3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2; ; and that this, too, is\n a kind of cheesecake we learn from what Solon says in his Iambics:\u2014 \n Some spend their time in drinking, and eating cakes, \n And some eat bread, and others feast on \u03b3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \n \n Mingled with lentils; and there is no kind \n Of dainty wanting there, but all the fruits \n Which the rich earth brings forth as food for men \n Are present in abundance. \n \n \n There are also criban\u00e6; and \u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 is a name\n given by Alcman to some cheesecakes, as Apollodorus tells us. And Sosibius asserts\n the same thing, in the third book of his Essay on Alcman; and he says they are in\n shape like a breast, and that the Laced\u00e6monians use them at the banquets of women,\n and that the female friends of the bride, who follow her in a chorus, carry them\n about when they are going to sing an encomium which has been prepared in her\n honour. \n There is also the crimnites, which is a kind of cheesecake made of a coarser sort\n of barley-meal ( \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ), as Iatrocles tells us in\n his treatise on Cheesecakes. \n ","54":"\n Then there is the staitites; and this, too, is a species of cheesecake made of\n wheaten-flour and honey. Epicharmus mentions it in his Hebe's Wedding; but the\n wheaten-flour is wetted, and then put into a frying-pan; and after that honey is\n sprinkled over it, and sesame, and cheese; as Iatrocles tells us. \n There is also the charisius. This is mentioned by Aristophanes in his Daitaleis,\n where he says\u2014 \n But I will send them in the evening \n A charisian cheesecake. \n And Eubulus, in his Ancylion, speaks of it as if it were plain bread:\u2014\n \n I only just leapt out, \n While baking the charisius. \n \n \n Then there is the \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, which is a\n barley-cake, made like a cheesecake, to be eaten after supper; as Philemon tells\n us in his treatise on Attic Names. \n There is also the nanus, which is a loaf made like a cheesecake, prepared with\n cheese and oil. \n There are also \u03c8\u03ce\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1, which are likewise called\n \u03c8\u03b1\u03b8\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1. Pherecrates, in the Crapatalli, says\u2014\n \n And in the shades below you'll get for threepence \n A crapatallus, and some \u03c8\u03ce\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n But Apollodorus the Athenian, and Theodorus, in his treatise on the Attic Dialect, say that the crumbs which are knocked\n off from a loaf are called \u03c8\u03ce\u03c6\u03b9\u03b1, , which some\n people also call \u1f00\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n Then there is the \u1f34\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. This is a thin cake,\n made of sesame and honey; and it is mentioned by Anacreon thus:\u2014 \n I broke my fast, taking a little slice \n Of an \u1f34\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; but I drank a cask of wine. \n And Aristophanes, in his Acharnians, says\u2014 \n Cheesecakes, and cakes of sesame, and \u1f34\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n And Sophocles, in his Contention, says\u2014 \n But I, being hungry, look back at the \u1f34\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n \n \n There is mention made also of \u1f04\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9. Philetas, in\n his Miscellanies, says that cakes of honey are called \u1f04\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9; and they are made by a regular baker. \n There is the \u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, too; which is a cheesecake\n fried in oil. Magnes, or whoever it was that wrote the comedies which are\n attributed to him, says in the second edition of his Bacchus\u2014 \n Have you ne'er seen the fresh \u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 \n hissing, \n When you pour honey over them? \n And Cratinus, in his Laws, says\u2014 \n The fresh \u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, dropping morning\n dew. \n \n \n Then there is the \u1f14\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2. . This is a cheesecake\n made on the festival of Elaphebolia, of wheat-flour, and honey, and sesame. \n The \u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 is a kind of cheesecake, having\n stuffing inside it. \n ","55":"\n \n \u03c7\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 are cakes made up with honey and milk. \n The \u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b2\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 is a species of cheesecake in\n fashion among the Sicilians. But some people call it \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac. And among the Coans it is called \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, , as we are informed by Iatrocles. \n Then there are the \u03c3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, which are cakes made\n of honey, and roasted sesame, and oil, of a round shape. Eupolis, in his\n Flatterers, says\u2014 \n He is all grace, he steps like a callabis-dancer, \n And breathes sesamides, and smells of apples. \n And Antiphanes, in his Deucalion, says\u2014 \n Sesamides, or honey-cheesecakes, \n Or any other dainty of the kind. \n And Ephippus, in his Cydon, also mentions them in a passage which has\n been already quoted. \n \n Then there are \u03bc\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9. Heraclides the Syracusan,\n in his treatise on Laws, says, that in Syracuse, on the principal day of the\n Thesmophorian festival, cakes of a peculiar shape are made of sesame and honey,\n which are called \u03bc\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 throughout all Sicily, and\n are carried about as offerings to the goddesses. There is also the echinus.\n Lynceus the Samian, in his epistle to Diagoras, comparing the things which are\n considered dainties in Attica with those which are in esteem at Rhodes, writes\n thus: They have for the second course a rival to the fame of the \u1f04\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 in a new antagonist called the \u1f10\u03c7\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, concerning which I will speak briefly; but\n when you come and see me, and eat one which shall be prepared for you in the\n Rhodian mariner, then I will endeavour to say more about it. \n \n There are also cheesecakes named \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9. \n Heracleon of Ephesus tells us that those cheesecakes have this name which are made\n of the third part of a ch\u0153nix of wheat. \n There are others called \u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, which are\n mentioned by Iatrocles in his treatise on Cheesecakes; and he speaks also of that\n which is called \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, which he says differs\n from the \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03c2, inasmuch as this latter is made\n of bruised wheat which has been softened with honey. And these cheesecakes are in\n nightly festivals given as prizes to the man who has kept awake all night. \n ","56":"\n But Chrysippus of Tyana, in his book called the Art of Making Bread, enumerates\n the following species and genera of cheesecakes:\u2014 The terentinum, the\n crassianum, the tutianum, the sabellicum, the clustron, the julianum, the\n apicia- num, the canopicum, the pelucidum, the cappadocium, the hedybium, the\n maryptum, the plicium, the guttatum, the montianum. This last, he says,\n \"you will soften with sour wine, and if you have a little cheese you may mash the\n montianum up half with wine and half with cheese, and so it will be more\n palatable. Then there is the clustrum curia- num, the clustrum tuttatum, and the\n clustrum tabonianum. There are also mustacia made with mead, mustacia made with\n sesame, crustum purium, gosgloanium, and paulianum. \n \n The following cakes resembling cheesecakes, he says, are\n really made with cheese:\u2014the enchytus, the scriblites, the subityllus. There is\n also another kind of subityllus made of groats. Then there is the spira; this,\n too, is made with cheese. There are, too, the lucuntli, the argyrotryphema, the\n libos, the cercus, the \u00e6xaphas, the clustroplacous. There\n is also, says Chrysippus, \"a cheesecake made of rye. The phthois is\n made thus:\u2014Take some cheese and pound it, then put it into a brazen sieve and\n strain it; then put in honey and a hemina of flour made from\n spring wheat, and beat the whole together into one mass. \n \"There is another cake, which is called by the Romans catillus ornatus, and which\n is made thus:\u2014Wash some lettuces and scrape them; then put some wine into a mortar\n and pound the lettuces in it; then, squeezing out the juice, mix up some flour\n from spring wheat in it, and allowing it to settle, after a little while pound it\n again, adding a little pig's fat and pepper; then pound it again, draw it out into\n a cake, smoothe it, and cut it again, and cut it into shape, and boil it in hot\n oil, putting all the fragments which you have cut off into a strainer. \n \"Other kinds of cheesecakes are the following:\u2014the ostra- cites, the attanites,\n the amylum, the tyrocoscinnm. Make this last thus:\u2014Pound some cheese ( \u03c4\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) carefully, and put it into a vessel; then place\n above it a brazen sieve ( \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ) and strain the\n cheese through it. And when you are going to serve it up, then put in above it a\n sufficient quantity of honey. The cheesecakes called \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 are made thus:\u2014Put some honey into some milk, pound them,\n and put them into a vessel, and let them coagulate; then, if you have some little\n sieves at hand, put what is in the vessel into them, and let. the whey run off;\n and when it appears to you to have coagulated thoroughly, then take up the vessel\n in which it is, and transfer it to a silver dish, and the coat, or crust, will be\n uppermost. But if you have no such sieves; then use some new fans, such as those\n which are used to blow the fire; for they will serve the same purpose. Then there\n is the coptoplacous. And also,\" says he, in Crete they make a kind of\n cheesecake which they call gastris. And it is made thus:\u2014 Take some Thasian and\n Pontic nuts and some almonds, and also a poppy. Roast this last with great\n care, and then take the seed and pound it in a clean mortar; then, adding the\n fruits which I have mentioned above, beat them up with boiled honey, putting in\n plenty of pepper, and make the whole into a soft mass, (but it will be of a\n black colour because of the poppy;) flatten it and make it into a square shape; then, having pounded some white sesame, soften that\n too with boiled honey, and draw it out into two cakes, placing one beneath and\n the other above, so as to have the black surface in the middle, and make it\n into a neat shape. These are the recipes of that clever writer on\n confectionary, Chrysippus. \n ","57":"\n But Harpocration the Mendesian, in his treatise on Cheesecakes, speaks of a dish\n which the Alexandrians call \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03b1. Now this\n dish consists of a number of cakes mashed up together and boiled with honey. And\n after they are boiled, they are made up into round balls, and fastened round with\n a thin string of byblus in order to keep them together. There is also a dish\n called \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which Alcman mentions in the\n following terms\u2014 \n And then we'll give you poltos made of beans ( \u03c0\u03c5\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ), \n And snow-white wheaten groats from unripe corn, \n And fruit of wax. \n But the substantive \u03c0\u03c5\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, as Sosibius\n tells us, means a collection of all kinds of seeds boiled up in sweet wine. And\n \u03c7\u1fd6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 means boiled grains of wheat. And when\n he speaks here of waxy fruit, he means honey. And Epicharmus, in his Earth and\n Sea, speaks thus\u2014 \n To boil some morning \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n And Pherecrates mentions the cakes called \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd in his Deserters, speaking as follows\u2014 \n As one man smells like goats, but others \n Breathe from their mouths unalloy'd \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2. \n \n \n \n ","58":"\n And when all this had been said, the wise Ulpian said,\u2014Whence, my most learned\n grammarians, and out of what library, have these respectable writers, Chrysippus\n and Harpocration, been extracted, men who bring the names of illustrious\n philosophers into disrepute by being their namesakes? And what Greek has ever used\n the word \u1f21\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b1; or who has ever mentioned the\n \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3? \" And when Laurentius answered him, and\n said,\u2014Whoever the authors of the poems attributed to Epicharmus were, they were\n acquainted with the \u1f21\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b1. And we find the\n following expressions in the play entitled Chiron\u2014 \n And to drink twice the quantity of cool water,\u2014 \n Two full heminas. \n And these spurious poems, attributed to Epicharmus, were, at all events,\n written by eminent men. For it was Chry- sogonus the\n flute-player, as Aristoxenus tells us in the eighth book of his Political Laws,\n who wrote the poem entitled Polity. And Philochorus, in his treatise on\n Divination, says that it was a man of the name of Axiopistos, (whether he was a\n Locrian or a Sicyonian is uncertain,) who was the author of the Canon and the\n Sentences. And Apollodous tells us the same thing. And Teleclides mentions the\n \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in his Rigid Men, speaking thus\u2014 \n Hot cheesecakes now are things I'm fond of, \n Wild pears I do not care about; \n I also like rich bits of hare \n Placed on an \u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n \n \n ","59":"\n When Ulpian had heard this, he said\u2014But, since you have also a cake which you call\n \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u1f74, and I see that there is one served up\n for each of you on the table, tell us now, you epicures, what writer of authority\n ever mentions this word \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae? And Democritus\n replied-Dionysius of Utica, in the seventh book of his Georgics, says that the sea\n leek is called \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae. And as for the honey-cake\n which is now served up before each of us, Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise\n on Riddles, mentions that, saying\u2014\"If any one were to order a number of vessels to\n be mentioned which resemble one another, he might say, \n A tripod, a bowl, a candlestick, a marble mortar, \n A bench, a sponge, a caldron, a boat, a metal mortar, \n An oil-cruse, a basket, a knife, a ladle, \n A goblet, and a needle. \n And after that he gives a list of the names of different dishes, thus\u2014\n \n Soup, lentils, salted meat, and fish, and turnips, \n Garlic, fresh meat, and tunny-roe, pickles, onions, \n Olives, and artichokes, capers, truffles, mushrooms. \n And in the same way he gives a catalogue of cakes, and sweetmeats, thus\u2014\n \n Ames, placous, entiltos, itrium, \n \n Pomegranates, eggs, vetches, and sesame; \n Copt\u00e8 and grapes, dried figs, and pears and peaches \n Apples and almonds.\" \n These are the words of Clearchus. But Sopater the farce writer, in his\n drama entitled Pyl\u00e6, says\u2014 \n Who was it who invented first black cakes ( \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76 ) \n Of the uncounted poppy-seed? who mix'd \n The yellow compounds of delicious sweetmeats? \n \n Here my excellent cross-examiner, Ulpian, you have autho-\n rities for \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae; and so now I advise you \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd some. And he, without any delay, took and ate\n some. And when they all laughed, Democritus said;\u2014But, my fine word-catcher, I did\n not desire you to eat, but not to eat; for the word \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03c9 is used in the sense of abstaining from eating by Theopompus\n the comic poet, in his Phineus, where he says\u2014 \n Cease gambling with the dice, my boy, and now \n Feed for the future more on herbs. Your stomach \n Is hard with indigestion; give up eating ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b9\u03b5 ) \n Those fish that cling to the rocks; the lees of wine \n Will make your head and senses clear, and thus \n You'll find your health, and your estate too, better. \n Men do, however, use \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03c9 for to eat a\n portion of anything, as Hermippus does, in his Soldiers\u2014 \n Alas! alas! he bites me now, he bites, \n And quite devours ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03b5\u03b9 ) my ears. \n \n \n ","60":"\n The Syrian being convicted by these arguments, and being a good deal annoyed,\n said\u2014But I see here on the table some pistachio nuts ( \u03c8\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ); and if you can tell me what author has ever spoken of\n them, I will give you, not ten golden staters, as that Pontic trifler has it, but\n this goblet. And as Democritus made no reply, he said, But since you cannot answer\n me, I will tell you; Nicander of Colophon, in his Theriacans, mentions them, and\n says\u2014 \n Pistachio nuts ( \u03c8\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ) upon the highest\n branches, \n Like almonds to the sight. \n The word is also written \u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1, , in\n the line\u2014 \n And almond-looking \u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 were there. \n And Posidonius the Stoic, in the third book of his History, writes thus:\n \"But both Arabia and Syria produce the peach, and the nut which is called \u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; which bears a fruit in bunches like bunches\n of grapes, of a sort of tawny white, long shaped, like tears, and the nuts lie on\n one another like berries. But the kernel is of a light green, and it is less juicy\n than the pine-cone, but it has a more pleasant smell. And the brothers who\n together composed the Georgics, write thus, in the third book\u2014 There is also\n the ash, and the turpentine tree, which the Syrians call \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1. \n And these people spell the word \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 \n with a \u03c0, but Nicander writes it \u03c6\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1, and Posidonius \u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1. \n \n ","61":"\n And when he had said this, looking round on all those who\n were present, and being praised by them, he, said,\u2014But I mean also to discuss\n every other dish that there is on the table, in order to make you admire my varied\n learning. And first of all I will speak of those which the Alexandrians call\n \u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 and \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. And they are mentioned also by Agathocles of Cyzicus, in\n the third book of his History of his Country; where he says: \"But after the\n thunderbolt had struck the tomb, there sprung up from the monument a tree which\n they call \u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. And this tree is not at all\n inferior in size to the elm or the fir. And it has great numbers of branches, of\n great length and rather thorny; but its leaf is tender and green, and of a round\n shape. And it bears fruit twice a year, in spring and autumn. And the fruit is\n very sweet, and of the size of a phaulian olive, which it resembles both in its\n flesh and in its stone; but it is superior in the good flavour of its juice. And\n the fruit is eaten while still green; and when it has become dry they make it into\n paste, and eat it without either bruising it or softening it with water, but\n taking it in very nearly its natural state. And Euripides, in the Cyclops, speaks\n of\u2014 \n \n \n A branch of paliurus. \n \n Eur. Cycl. 393. \n \n But Theopompus, in the twenty-first book of his History of Philip,\n mentions them, and Diphilus, the physician of Siphnus, also speaks of them, in his\n treatise on What may be eaten by People in Health, and by Invalids. But I have\n mentioned these things first, my good friends, not because they are before us at\n this moment, but because in the beautiful city of Alexandria, I have often eaten\n them as part of the second course, and as I have often heard the question as to\n their names raised there, I happened to fall in with a book here in which I read\n what I have now recounted to you. \n ","62":"\n And I will now take the pears ( \u1f04\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ), which I see\n before me, and speak of them, since it is from them that the Peloponnesus was\n called \u02bc\u1f00\u03c0\u03af\u03b1, \n because plants of the pear- tree were abundant in\n the country, as Ister tells us, in his treatise on the History of Greece. And that\n it was customary to bring up pears in water at entertainments, we learn from the\n Breutias of Alexis, where we read these lines\u2014 \n \n A. Have you ne'er seen pears floating in deep\n water \n Served up before some hungry men at dinner? \n \n B. Indeed I have, and often; what of that? \n \n A. Does not each guest choose for himself, and\n eat \n The ripest of the fruit that swims before him? \n \n B. No doubt he does. \n But the fruit called \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 are not\n the same as pears, as some people have fancied, but they are a different thing,\n sweeter, and they have no kernel. Aristomenes, in his Bacchus, says\u2014 \n Know you not how the Chian garden grows \n Fine medlars \n And Aeschylides too, in the third book of his Georgics, shows us that it\n is a different fruit from the pear, and sweeter. For he is speaking of the island\n Ceos, and he expresses himself thus,\u2014 The island produces the very finest\n pears, equal to that fruit which in Ionia is called hamamelis; for they are\n free from kernels, and sweet, and delicious. But Aethlius, in the fifth\n book of his Samian Annals, if the book be genuine, calls them homomelides. And\n Pamphilus, in his treatise on Dialects and Names, says, The epimelis is a\n species of pear. Antipho, in his treatise on Agriculture, says that the\n phocides are also a kind of pear. \n ","63":"\n Then there are pomegranates. And of pomegranates some kinds are said to be\n destitute of kernels, and some to have hard ones. And those without kernels are\n mentioned by Aristophanes in his Farmers; and in his Anagyrus he says\u2014 \n Except wheat flour and pomegranates. \n He also speaks of them in the Gerytades; and Hermippus, in his Cercopes,\n says\u2014 \n Have you e'er seen the pomegranate's kernel in snow? \n And we find the diminutive form \u1fe5\u03bf\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \n like \u03b2\u03bf\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n Antiphanes also mentions the pomegranates with the hard kernels in his B\u0153otia\u2014\n \n I bade him bring me from the farm pomegranates \n Of the hard-kernell'd sort. \n And Epilycus, in his Phoraliscus, says\u2014 \n You are speaking of apples and pomegranates. \n \n Alexis also, in his Suitors, has the line\u2014 \n He took the rich pomegranates from their hands. \n But Agatharchides, in the nineteenth book of his History of Europe, tells\n us that the B\u0153otians call pomegranates not \u1fe5\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u1f76 \n but \u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, speaking thus:\u2014 As the Athenians\n were disputing with the B\u0153otians about a district which they called Sid\u00e6,\n Epaminondas, while engaged in upholding the claims of the B\u0153otians, suddenly\n lifted up in his left hand a pomegranate which he had concealed, and showed it\n to the Athenians, asking them what they called it, and when they said \u1fe5\u03bf\u03b9\u1f70, But we,' said he, ' call it \u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b7. .' And the district bears the pomegranate-tree\n in great abundance, from which it originally derived its name. And Epaminondas\n prevailed. And Menander, in his Heauton-Timorumenos, called them\n \u1fe5\u03bf\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1, in the following lines\u2014 \n And after dinner I did set before them \n Almonds, and after that we ate pomegranates. \n There is, however, another plant called sida, which is something like the\n pomegranate, and which grows in the lake Orchomenus, in the water itself; and the\n sheep eat its leaves, and the pigs feed on the young shoots, as Theophrastus tells\n us, in the fourth book of his treatise on Plants; where he says that there is\n another plant like it in the Nile, which grows without any roots. \n ","64":"\n The next thing to be mentioned are dates. Xenophon, in the second book of his\n Anabasis, says\u2014 And there was in the district a great deal of corn, and wine\n made of the dates, and also vinegar, which was extracted from them; but the\n berries themselves of the date when like what we see in Greece, were set apart\n for the slaves. But those which were destined for the masters were all\n carefully selected, being of a wonderful size and beauty, and their colour was\n like amber. And some they dry and serve up as sweetmeats; and the wine made\n from the date is sweet, but it produces headache. And Herodotus, in his\n first book, speaking of Babylon says,\u2014 There are palm-trees there growing\n over the whole plain, most of them being very fruitful; and they make bread,\n and wine, and honey of them. And they manage the tree in the same way as the\n fig-tree. For those palm-trees which they call the males they take, and bind\n their fruit to the other palm-trees which bear dates, in order that the insect\n which lives in the fruit of the male palm may get into the date and ripen it,\n and so prevent the fruit of the date-bearing palm from\n being spoilt. For the male palm has an insect in each of its fruits, as the\n wild fig has. And Polybius of Megalopolis, who speaks with the\n authority of an eye-witness, gives very nearly the same account of the lotus, as\n it is called, in Libya, that Herodotus here gives of the palm-tree; for he speaks\n thus of it: And the lotus is a tree of no great size, but rough and thorny,\n and its leaf is green like that of the rhamnus, but a little thicker and\n broader. And the fruit at first resembles both in colour and size the berries\n of the white myrtle when full grown; but as it increases in size it becomes of\n a scarlet colour, and in size about equal to the round olives; and it has an\n exceedingly small stone. But when it is ripe they gather it. And some they\n store for the use of the servants, bruising it and mixing it with groats, and\n packing it into vessels. And that which is preserved for freemen is treated in\n the same way, only that the stones are taken out, and then they pack that fruit\n also in jars, and eat it when they please. And it is a food very like the fig,\n and also like the palm-date, but superior in fragrance. And when it is\n moistened and pounded with water, a wine is made of it, very sweet and\n enjoyable to the taste, and like fine mead; and they drink it without water;\n but it will not keep more than ten days, on which account they only make it in\n small quantities as they want it. They also make vinegar of the same\n fruit. \n \n ","65":"\n And Melanippides the Melian, in his Danaides, calls the fruit of the palm-tree by\n the name of \u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03be, mentioning them in this\n manner:\u2014 They had the appearance of inhabitants of the shades below, not\n of human beings; nor had they voices like women; but they drove about in\n chariots with seats, through the woods and groves, just as wild beasts do,\n holding in their hands the sacred frankincense, and the fragrant dates\n ( \u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 ), and cassia, and the delicate\n perfumes of Syria. \n \n \n And Aristotle, in his treatise on Plants, speaks thus:\u2014 The dates ( \u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 ) without stones, which some call eunuchs and\n others \u1f00\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9. . Hellanicus has also\n called the fruit \u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03be, in his Journey to the\n Temple of Ammon, if at least. the book be a genuine one; and so has Phormus the\n comic poet, in his Atalant\u00e6. But concerning those that are called the Nicolaan dates, which are imported from Syria, I can give\n you this information; that they received this name from Augustus the emperor,\n because he was exceedingly fond of the fruit, and because Nicolaus of Damascus,\n who was his friend, was constantly sending him presents of it. And this Nicolaus\n was a philosopher of the Peripatetic School, and wrote a very voluminous\n history. \n ","66":"\n Now with respect to dried figs. Those which came from Attica were always\n considered a great deal the best. Accordingly Dinon, in his History of Persia,\n says\u2014 And they used to serve up at the royal table all the fruits which\n the earth produces as far as the king's dominions extend, being brought to him\n from every district as a sort of first-fruits. And the first king did not think\n it becoming for the kings either to eat or drink anything which came from any\n foreign country; and this idea gradually acquired the force of a law. For once,\n when one of the eunuchs brought the king, among the rest of the dishes at\n dessert, some Athenian dried figs, the king asked where they came from. And\n when he heard that they came from Athens, he forbade those who had bought them\n to buy them for him any more, until it should be in his power to take them\n whenever he chose, and not to buy them. And it is said that the eunuch did this\n on purpose, with a view to remind him of the expedition against Attica. \n And Alexis, in his Pilot, says\u2014 \n Then came in figs, the emblem of fair Athens, \n And bunches of sweet thyme. \n \n \n And Lynceus, in his epistle to the comic poet, Posidippus, says\u2014 In the\n delineation of the tragic passions, I do not think that Euripides is at all\n superior to Sophocles, but in dried figs, I do think that Attica is superior to\n every other country on earth. And in his letter to Diagoras, he writes\n thus:\u2014\"But this country opposes to the Chelidonian dried figs those which are\n called Brigindarid\u00e6, which in their name indeed are barbarous, but which in\n delicious flavour are not at all less Attic than the others. And Ph\u0153nicides, in\n his Hated Woman, says\u2014 \n They celebrate the praise of myrtle-berries, \n Of honey, of the Propyl\u00e6a, and of figs; \n Now these I tasted when I first arrived, \n And saw the Propyl\u00e6a; yet have I found nothing \n Which to a woodcock can for taste compare. \n In which lines we must take notice of the mention of the woodcock. But Philemon, in his treatise on Attic Names, says\n that the most excellent dried figs are those called Aegilides; and that\n Aegila is the name of a borough in Attica, which derives its name from a hero\n called Aegilus; but that the dried figs of a reddish black colour are called\n Chelidonians. Theopompus also, in the Peace, praising the Tithrasian\n figs, speaks thus\u2014 \n Barley cakes, cheesecakes, and Tithrasian figs. \n But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men, (for really, as\n Aristophanes says\u2014 \n There's really nothing nicer than dried figs;) \n that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to Antiochus,\n entreating him (it is Hegesander who tells this story) to buy and send him some\n sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a sophist; and that Antiochus wrote to him in\n answer, \"The dried figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful\n for a sophist to be sold in Greece. The Greeks were also in the habit of eating\n dried figs roasted, as Pherecrates proves by what he says in the Corianno, where\n we find\u2014 \n But pick me out some of those roasted figs. \n And a few lines later he says\u2014 \n Will you not bring me here some black dried figs \n Dost understand? Among the Mariandyni, \n That barbarous tribe, they call these black dried figs \n Their dishes. \n I am aware, too, that Pamphilus has mentioned a kind of dried figs, which\n he calls \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n ","67":"\n That the word \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2 is common for a bunch of\n grapes is known to every one; and Crates, in the second book of his Attic Dialect,\n uses the word \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f74, although it appears to be a\n word of Asiatic origin; saying that in some of the ancient hymns the word \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f74. is used for \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2, as in the following line:\u2014 \n Thick hanging with the dusky grapes ( \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9 ) themselves. \n \n \n And that the word \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f74 is used by Homer is\n known to every one. But Plato, in the eighth book of his Laws, uses both \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2 and \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f74, \n where he says\u2014 Whoever tastes wild fruit, whether it be grapes ( \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd ) or figs, before the time of the vintage\n arrives, which falls at the time of the rising of Arcturus, whether it be on\n his own farm, or on any one else's land, shall be fined fifty sacred drachmas\n to be paid to Bacchus, if he plucked them off his own land; but a mina if he gather them on a neighbour's estate; but if he take\n them from any other place, two-thirds of a mina. But whoever chooses to gather\n the grapes ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd ), which are now called\n the noble grapes, or the figs called the noble figs, if he gather them from his\n own trees, let him gather them as he pleases, and when he pleases; but if he\n gathers them from the trees of any one else without having obtained the leave\n of the owner, then, in accordance with the law which forbids any one to move\n what he has not placed, he shall be invariably punished. These are the\n words of the divine Plato; but I ask now what is this noble grape ( \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 ), and this noble fig that he speaks of? And you\n may all consider this point while I am discussing the other dishes which are on\n the table. And Masurius said\u2014 \n But let us not postpone this till to-morrow, \n Still less till the day after. \n \n \n When the philosopher says \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1, he means\n \u03b5\u1f50\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u1fc6, , gene- rous, as\n Archilochus also uses the word\u2014 \n Come hither, you are generous ( \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 ); \n or, perhaps, he means \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1; that\n is to say, grafted. For Aristotle speaks of grafted pears, and calls them \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. And Demosthenes, in his speech in defence\n of Ctesiphon, has the sentence, gathering figs, and grapes ( \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2 ), and olives. And Xenophon, in his\n (Economics, says, that grapes ( \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u1f70\u03c2 ) are ripened by the sun. And our ancestors also have\n been acquainted with the practice of steeping grapes in wine. Accordingly Eubulus,\n in his Catacollomenos, says\u2014 \n But take these grapes ( \u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2 ), and in neat\n wine pound them. \n And pour upon them many cups of water. \n Then make him eat them when well steep'd in wine. \n And the poet, who is the author of the Chiron, which is generally\n attributed to Pherecrates, says\u2014 \n Almonds and apples, and the arbutus first, \n And myrtle-berries, pastry, too, and grapes \n Well steep'd in wine; and marrow. \n And that every sort of autumn fruit was always plentiful at Athens,\n Aristophanes testifies in his Hor\u00e6. Why, then, should that appear strange which\n Aethlius the Samian asserts in the fifth book of his Samian Annals, where he says,\n The fig, and the grape, and the medlar, and the apple, and the rose grow\n twice a-year? And Lynceus, in his letter to \n Diagoras, praising the Nicostratian grape, which grows in Attica, and comparing it\n to the Rhodiacan, says, As rivals of the Nicostratian grapes they grow the\n Hipponian grape; which after the month Hecatomb\u00e6on (like a good servant) has\n constantly the same good disposition towards its masters. \n \n ","68":"\n But as you have had frequent discussions about meats, and birds, and pigeons, I\n also will tell you all that I, after a great deal of reading, have been able to\n find out in addition to what has been previously stated. Now the word \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (pigeon), may be found used by Menander in\n his Concubine, where he says\u2014 \n He waits a little while, and then runs up \n And says\u2014 I've bought some pigeons ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 ) for you. \n \n And so Nicostratus, in his Delicate Woman, says\u2014 \n These are the things I want,\u2014a little bird, \n And then a pigeon ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) and a\n paunch. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Reciprocal Lover, has the line\u2014 \n For bringing in some pigeons ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 )\n and some sparrows. \n And Phrynichus, in his Tragedians, says\u2014 \n Bring him a pigeon ( \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) for a\n threepenny piece. \n \n \n Now with respect to the pheasant, Ptolemy the king, in the twelfth book of his\n Memorabilia, speaking of the palace which there is at Alexandria, and of the\n animals which are kept in it, says, They have also pheasants, which they\n call \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, which they not only used to send\n for from Media, but they also used to put the eggs under broody hens, by which\n means they raised a number, so as to have enough for food; for they call it\n very excellent eating. Now this is the expression of a most magnificent\n monarch, who confesses that he himself has never tasted a pheasant, but who used\n to keep these birds as a sort of treasure. But if he had ever seen such a sight as\n this, when, in addition to all those which have been already eaten, a pheasant is\n also placed before each individual, he would have added another book to the\n existing twenty-four of that celebrated history, which he calls his Memorabilia.\n And Aristotle or Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, says, In pheasants, the\n male is not only as much superior to the female as is usually the case, but he\n is so in an infinitely greater degree. \n \n ","69":"\n But if the before-mentioned king had seen the number of peacocks also which exists\n at Rome, he would have fled to his sacred Senate, as though he had a second time\n been driven out of his kingdom by his brother. For the\n multitude of these birds is so great at Rome, that Antiphanes the comic poet, in\n his Soldier or Tychon, may seem to have been inspired by the spirit of prophecy,\n when he said\u2014 \n When the first man imported to this city \n A pair of peacocks, they were thought a rarity, \n But now they are more numerous than quails; \n So, if by searching you find one good man, \n He will be sure to have five worthless sons. \n And Alexis, in his Lamp, says\u2014 \n That he should have devour'd so vast a sum! \n Why if (by earth I swear) I fed on hares' milk \n And peacocks, I could never spend so much. \n And that they used to keep them tame in their houses, we learn from\n Strattis, in his Pausanias, where he says\u2014 \n Of equal value with your many trifles, \n And peacocks, which you breed up for their feathers. \n And Anaxandrides, in his Melilotus, says\u2014 \n Is 't not a mad idea to breed up peacocks, \n When every one can buy his private ornaments? \n And Anaxilaus, in his Bird Feeders, says\u2014 \n Besides all this, tame peacocks, loudly croaking. \n Menodotus the Samian also, in his treatise on the Treasures in the Temple\n of the Samian Juno, says: The peacocks are sacred to Juno; and perhaps\n Samos may be the place where they were first produced and reared, and from\n thence it was that they were scattered abroad over foreign countries, in the\n same way as cocks were originally produced in Persia, and the birds called\n guinea-fowl ( \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) in Aeolia. On\n which account Antiphanes, in his Brothers by the same Father, says\u2014 \n They say that in the city of the Sun \n The ph\u0153nix is produced; the owl in Athens; \n Cyprus breeds doves of admirable beauty: \n But Juno, queen of Samos, does, they say, \n Rear there a golden race of wondrous birds, \n The brilliant, beautiful, conspicuous peacock. \n On which account the peacock occurs on the coins of the Samians. \n ","70":"\n But since Menodotus has mentioned the guinea-fowl, we ourselves also will say\n something on that subject. Clytus the Milesian, a pupil of Aristotle, in the first\n book of his History of Miletus, writes thus concerning them\u2014 All around the temple of the Virgin Goddess at Leros, there\n are birds called guinea-fowls. And the ground where they are bred is marshy.\n And this bird is very devoid of affection towards its young, and wholly\n disregards its offspring, so that the priests are forced to take care of them.\n And it is about the size of a very fine fowl of the common poultry, its head is\n small in proportion to its body, having but few feathers, but on the top it has\n a fleshy crest, hard and round, sticking up above the head like a peg, and of a\n wooden colour. And over the jaws, instead of a beard, they have a long piece of\n flesh, beginning at the mouth, redder than that of the common poultry; but of\n that which exists in the common poultry on the top of the beak, which some\n people call the beard, they are wholly destitute; so that their beak is\n mutilated in this respect. But its beak is sharper and larger than that of the\n common fowl; its neck is black, thicker and shorter than that of common\n poultry. And its whole body is spotted all over, the general colour being\n black, studded in every part with thick white spots something larger than\n lentil seeds. And these spots are ring-shaped, in the middle of patches of a\n darker hue than the rest of the plumage: so that these patches present a\n variegated kind of appearance, the black part having a sort of white tinge, and\n the white seeming a good deal darkened. And their wings are all over variegated\n with white, in serrated, wavy lines, parallel to each other.\n And their legs are destitute of spurs like those of the common hen. And the\n females are very like the males, on which account the sex of the guinea-fowls\n is hard to distinguish. Now this is the account given of guinea-fowls\n by the Peripatetic philosopher. \n ","71":"\n Roasted sucking-pigs are a dish mentioned by Epicrates in his Merchant\u2014 \n On this condition I will be the cook; \n Nor shall all Sicily boast that even she \n Produced so great an artist as to fish, \n Nor Elis either, where I 've seen the flesh \n Of dainty sucking-pigs well brown'd before \n A rapid fire. \n And Alexis, in his Wicked Woman, says\u2014 \n A delicate slice of tender sucking-pig, \n Bought for three obols, hot, and very juicy, \n When it is set before us. \n \n But the Athenians,\" as Philochorus tells us, when\n they sacri- fice to the Seasons, do not roast, but boil their meat, entreating\n the goddesses to defend them from all excessive droughts and heats, and to give\n increase to their crops by means of moderate warmth and seasonable rains. For\n they argue that roasting is a kind of cookery which does less good to the meat,\n while boiling not only removes all its crudities, but has the power also of\n softening the hard parts, and of making all the rest digestible. And it makes\n the food more tender and wholesome, on which account they say also, that when\n meat has been once boiled, it ought not to be warmed up again by either\n roasting or boiling it; for ally second process removes the good done by the\n first dressing, as Aristotle tells us. And roast meat is more crude and dry\n than boiled meat. But roast meat is called \u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. Accordingly Strattis in his Callippides says, with\n reference to Hercules\u2014 \n Immediately he caught up some large slices ( \u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) \n Of smoking roasted boar, and swallow'd them. \n And Archippus, in his Hercules Marrying, says\u2014 \n The pettitoes of little pigs, well cook'd \n In various fashion; slices, too, of bulls \n With sharpen'd horns, and great long steaks of boar, \n All roasted ( \u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ). \n \n \n ","72":"\n But why need I say anything of partridges, when so much has already been said by\n you? However, I will not omit what is related by Hegesander in his Commentaries.\n For he says that the Samians, when sailing to Sybaris, having touched at the\n district called Siritis, were so alarmed at the noise made by partridges which\n rose up and flew away, that they fled, and embarked on board their ships, and\n sailed away. \n Concerning hares also Cham\u00e6leon says, in his treatise on Simonides, that Simonides\n once, when supping with king Hiero, as there was no hare set on the table in front\n of him as there was before all the other guests, but as Hiero afterwards helped\n him to some, made this extempore verse\u2014 \n Nor, e'en though large, could he reach all this way. \n But Simonides was, in fact, a very covetous man, addicted to disgraceful\n gain, as we are told by Cham\u00e6leon. And accordingly in Syracuse, as Hiero used to\n send him everything necessary for his daily subsistence in great abundance,\n Simonides used to sell the greater part of what was sent to \n him by the king, and reserve only a small portion for his own use. And when some\n one asked him the reason of his doing so, he said\u2014 In order that both the\n liberality of Hiero and my economy may be visible to every one. \n \n The dish called udder is mentioned by Teleclides, in his Rigid Men, in the\n following lines\u2014 \n Being a woman, 'tis but reasonable \n That I should bring an udder. \n But Antidotus uses not the word \u03bf\u1f56\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1, \n but \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, in his Querulous Man. \n ","73":"\n Matron, in his Parodies, speaks of animals being fattened for food, and birds\n also, in these lines\u2014 \n Thus spake the hero, and the servants smiled, \n And after brought, on silver dishes piled, \n Fine fatten'd birds, clean singed around with flame, \n Like cheesecakes on the back, their age the same. \n And Sopater the farce-writer speaks of fattened sucking-pigs in his\n Marriage of Bacchis, saying this\u2014 \n If there was anywhere an oven, there \n The well-fed sucking-pig did crackle, roasting. \n But Aeschines uses the form \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd for\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be in his Alcibiades, saying, Just\n as the women at the cookshops breed sucking-pigs ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ). And Antiphanes, in his Physiognomist, says\u2014\n \n Those women take the sucking-pigs ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ), \n And fatten them by force; \n And in his Persuasive Man he says\u2014 \n To be fed up instead of pigs ( \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ). \n Plato, however, has used the word \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03be \n in the masculine gender in his Poet, where he says\u2014 \n Leanest of pigs ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ). \n And Sophocles, in his play called Insolence, says\u2014 \n Wishing to eat \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1. \n \n And Cratinus, in his Ulysseses, has the expression\u2014 \n Large pigs ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ). \n But Nicochares uses the word as feminine, saying\u2014 \n A pregnant sow ( \u03ba\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 ); \n And Eupolis, in his Golden Age, says\u2014 \n Did he not serve up at the feast a sucking-pig ( \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 ), \n Whose teeth were not yet grown, a beautiful beast ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd )? \n And Plato, in his Io, says\u2014 \n Bring hither now the head of the sucking-pig ( \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ). \n \n Theopompus, too, in his Penelope, says\u2014 \n And they do sacrifice our sacred pig ( \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70\u03bd\n \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 ). \n Theopompus also speaks of fatted geese and fatted calves in the\n thirteenth hook of his History of Philip, and in the eleventh book of his Affairs\n of Greece, where he is speaking of the temperance of the Laced\u00e6monians in respect\n of eating, writing thus\u2014 And the Thasians sent to Agesilais, when he\n arrived, all sorts of sheep and well-fed oxen; and beside this, every kind of\n confectionery and sweetmeat. But Agesilaus took the sheep and the oxen, but as\n for the confectionery and sweetmeats, at first he did not know what they meant,\n for they were covered up; but when he saw what they were, he ordered the slaves\n to take them away, saying that it was not the custom of the Laced\u00e6monians to\n eat such food as that. But as the Thasians pressed him to take them, he said,\n Carry them to those men (pointing to the Helots) and give them to them; saying\n that it was much better for those Helots to injure their health by eating them\n than for himself and the Laced\u00e6monians whom he had with him. And that\n the Laced\u00e6monians were in the habit of treating the Helots with great insolence,\n is related also by Myron of Priene, in the second book of his History of Messene,\n where he says\u2014 They impose every kind of insulting employment on the Helots,\n such as brings with it the most extreme dishonour; for they compel them to wear\n caps of dogskin, and cloaks also of skins; and every year they scourge them\n without their having committed any offence, in order to present their ever\n thinking of emancipating themselves from slavery. And besides all this, if any\n of them ever appear too handsome or distinguished-looking for slaves, they\n impose death as the penalty, and their masters also are fined for not checking\n them in their growth and fine appearances. And they give them each a certain\n piece of land, and fix a portion which they shall invariably bring them in from\n it. \n \n The verb \u03c7\u03b7\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, to cackle like a goose ( \u03c7\u1f74\u03bd ), is used and applied to those who play on the\n flute.

For\n Philemon, in his play entitled The Sicilian, says\u2014 \n I once did think that Sicily could make \n This one especial thing, good-flavour'd cheese; \n But now I've heard this good of it besides, \n That not only is the cheese of Sicily good, \n But all its pigeons too: and if one speaks \n Of richly-broider'd robes, they are Sicilian; \n And so I think that island now supplies \n All sorts of dainties and of furniture. \n \n \n The Tromilican cheese also has a high character, respecting\n which Demetrius the Scepsian writes thus in his second book of the Trojan\n Array\u2014\"Tromilea is a city of Achaia, near which a delicious cheese is made of\n goat's milk, not to be compared with any other kind, and it is called Tromilican.\n And Simonides mentions it in his Iambic poem, which begins thus\u2014 \n You're taking wondrous trouble beforehand, \n Telembrotus: \n and in this poem he says\u2014 \n And there is the fine Achaian cheese, \n Called the Tromilican, which I've brought with me. \n \n And Euripides, in his Cyclops, speaks of a harsh-tasted\n cheese, which he calls \u1f40\u03c0\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2, being curdled\n by the juice ( \u1f40\u03c0\u1f78\u03c2 ) of the fig-tree\u2014 \n \n \n There is, too, \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c0\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, and Jove's\n milk. \n \n Eur.

And Chrysippus\n the philosopher thinks the name \u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd is derived\n from the verb \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to eat; a cook being an\n ignorant man, and the slave of his appetite; not knowing that M\u00e6son was a comic\n actor, a Megarian by birth, who invented the mask which was called \u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd, from him; as Aristophanes of Byzantium tells us,\n in his treatise on Masks, where he says that he invented a mask for a slave and\n also one for a cook. So that it is a deserved compliment to him to call the jests\n which suit those characters \u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. \n \n For cooks are very frequently represented on the stage as jesting characters; as,\n for instance, in the Men selecting an Arbitrator, of Menander. And Philemon in one\n of his plays says\u2014 \n 'Tis a male sphinx, it seems, and not a cook, \n That I've brought home; for, by the gods I swear, \n I do not understand one single word \n Of all he says; so well provided is he \n With every kind of new expression. \n But Polemo says, in his writings which are addressed to Tim\u00e6us, that\n M\u00e6son was indeed a Megarian, but from Megara in Sicily, and not from Nis\u00e6a. And\n Posidippus speaks of slaves as cooks, in his Woman Shut out, where he says\u2014 \n Thus have these matters happen'd: but just now, \n While waiting on my master, a good joke \n Occurr'd to me; I never will be caught \n Stealing his meat. \n And, in his Foster Brothers, he says\u2014 \n \n A. Did you go out of doors, you who were cook? \n \n B. If I remain'd within I lost my supper. \n \n A. Let me then first . . . . B. Let me alone, I say; \n I'm going to the forum to sacrifice: \n A friend of mine, a comrade too in art, \n Has hired me. \n \n \n ","77":"\n And there was nothing extraordinary in the ancient cooks being experienced in\n sacrifices. At all events, they usually managed all marriage feasts and\n sacrifices. On which account Menander, in his Flatterer, introduces a cook, who on\n the fourth day of the month had been ministering in the festival of Aphrodite\n Pandemus, using the following language\u2014 \n Now a libation. Boy, distribute round \n The entrails. Whither are you looking now? \n Now a libation\u2014quick! you Sosia, quick! \n \n Quick! a libation. That will do; now pour. \n First let us pray to the Olympian gods, \n And now to all the Olympian goddesses: \n Meantime address them; pray them all to give \n Us safety, health, and all good things in future, \n And full enjoyment of all present happiness. \n Such shall be now our prayers. \n And another cook, in Simonides, says\u2014 \n And how I roasted, how I carved the meat, \n You know: what is there that I can't do well? \n And the letter of Olympias to Alexander mentions the great experience of\n cooks in these matters. For, his mother having been entreated by him to buy him a\n cook who had experience in sacrifices, proceeds to say, Accept the cook\n Pelignas from your mother; for he is thoroughly acquainted with the manner in\n which all your ancestral sacrifices, and all the mysterious rites, and all the\n sacred mysteries connected with the worship of Bacchus are performed, and every\n other sacrifice which Olympias practises he knows. Do not then disregard him,\n but accept him, and send him back again to me at as early a period as\n possible. \n \n ","78":"\n And that in those days the cook's profession was a respectable one, we may learn\n from the Heralds at Athens. For these men used to perform the duties of\n cooks and also of sacrificers of victims, as Clidemus tells us, in the\n first book of his Protogony; and Homer uses the verb \u1fe5\u03ad\u03b6\u03c9, as we use \u03b8\u03cd\u03c9; but he uses\n \u03b8\u03cd\u03c9 as we do \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03c9, for burning cakes and incense after supper. And the ancients\n used also to employ the verb \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 for to\n sacrifice; accordingly Clidemus says, The heralds used to sacrifice\n ( \u1f15\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd ) for a long time slaying the oxen,\n and preparing them, and cutting them up, and pouring wine over them. And they\n were called \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 from the hero Ceryx; and\n there is nowhere any record of any reward being given to a cook, but only to a\n herald. For Agamemnon in Homer, although he is king, performs\n sacrifices himself; for the poet says\u2014 \n \n \n With that the chief the tender victims slew, \n And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw; \n The vital spirit issued at the wound, \n And left the members quivering on the ground. \n \n Homer, Iliad, iii. 292. \n \n \n \n And Thrasymedes the son of Nestor, having taken an axe, slays the ox which was to\n be sacrificed, because Nestor himself was not able to do so, by reason of his old\n age; and his other brothers assisted him; so respectable and\n important was the office of a cook in those days. And among the Romans, the\n Censors,\u2014and that was the highest office in the whole state,\u2014clad in a purple\n robe, and wearing crowns, used to strike down the victims with an axe. Nor is it a\n random assertion of Homer, when he represents the heralds as bringing in the\n victims, and whatever else had any bearing on the ratification of oaths, as this\n was a very ancient duty of theirs, and one which was especially a part of their\n office\u2014 \n Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite \n The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite; \n and again\u2014 \n \n \n Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring \n The lamb for Jove, th' inviolable king. \n \n Homer, Iliad, iii. 116. \n \n And, in another passage, he says\u2014 \n \n \n A splendid scene! Then Agamemnon rose; \n The boar Talthybius held; the Grecian lord \n Drew the broad cutlass, sheath'd beside his sword. \n \n Homer, Iliad, xix. 250. \n \n \n \n ","79":"\n And in the first book of the History of Attica, Clidemus says, that there was a\n tribe of cooks, who were entitled to public honours; and that it was their\n business to see that the sacrifices were performed with due regularity. And it is\n no violation of probability in Athenion, in his Samothracians, as Juba says, when\n he introduces a cook arguing philosophically about the nature of things and men,\n and saying\u2014 \n \n A. Dost thou not know that the cook's art\n contributes \n More than all others to true piety? \n \n B. Is it indeed so useful A. \n Troth it is, \n You ignorant barbarian: it releases \n Men from a brutal and perfidious life, \n And cannibal devouring of each other, \n And leads us to some order; teaching us \n The regular decorum of the life \n Which now we practise. B. How is that? A. Just listen. \n Once men indulged in wicked cannibal habits, \n And numerous other vices; when a man \n Of better genius arose, who first \n Sacrificed victims, and did roast their flesh; \n And, as the meat surpass'd the flesh of man, \n They then ate men no longer, but did slay \n The herds and flocks, and roasted them and ate them. \n And when they once had got experience \n Of this most dainty pleasure. they increased \n In their devotion to the cook's employment; \n \n So that e'en now, remembering former days, \n They roast the entrails of their victims all \n Unto the gods, and put no salt thereon, \n For at the first beginning they knew not \n The use of salt as seasoning; but now \n They have found out its virtue, so they use it \n At their own meals, but in their holy offerings \n They keep their ancient customs; such as were \n At first the origin of safety to us: \n That love of art, and various seasoning, \n Which carries to perfection the cook's skill. \n \n B. Why here we have a new Pal\u00e6phatus. \n \n A. And after this, as time advanced, a paunch, \n A well-stuff'd paunch was introduced . . . . \n . . . . . . . . \n Then they wrapped up a fish, and quite concealed it \n In herbs, and costly sauce, and groats, and honey; \n And as, persuaded by these dainty joys \n Which now I mention, every one gave up \n His practice vile of feeding on dead men, \n Men now began to live in company, \n Gathering in crowds; cities were built and settled; \n All owing, as I said before, to cooks. \n \n B. Hail, friend! you are well suited to my\n master. \n \n A. We cooks are now beginning our grand rites; \n We're sacrificing, and libations offering, \n Because the gods are most attentive to us, \n Pleased that we have found out so many things, \n Tending to make men live in peace and happiness. \n \n B. Well, say no more about your piety\u2014 \n \n A. I beg your pardon\u2014 B. But\n come, eat with me, \n And dress with skill whate'er is in the house. \n \n \n ","80":"\n And Alexis, in his Caldron, shows plainly that cookery is an art practised by\n free-born men; for a cook is represented in that play as a citizen of no mean\n reputation; and those who have written cookery books, such as Heraclides and\n Glaucus the Locrian, say that the art of cookery is one in which it is not even\n every free-born man who can become eminent. And the younger Cratinus, in his play\n called the Giants, extols this art highly, saying\u2014 \n \n A. Consider, now, how sweet the earth doth\n smell, \n How fragrantly the smoke ascends to heaven: \n There lives, I fancy, here within this cave \n Some perfume-seller, or Sicilian cook. \n \n B. The scent of both is equally delicious. \n And Antiphanes, in his Slave hard to Sell, praises the Sicilian cooks,\n and says\u2014 \n And at the feast, delicious cakes, \n Well season'd by Sicilian art. \n \n And Menander, in his Spectre, says\u2014 \n Do ye applaud, \n If the meat's dress'd with rich and varied skill. \n But Posidippus, in his Man recovering his Sight, says\u2014 \n I, having had one cook, have thoroughly learnt \n All the bad tricks of cooks, while they compete \n With one another in their trade. One said \n His rival had no nose to judge of soup \n With critical taste; that other had \n A vicious palate; while a third could never \n (If you'd believe the rest) restrain his appetite, \n Without devouring half the meat he dress'd. \n This one loved salt too much, and that one vinegar; \n One burnt his meat; one gorged; one could not stand \n The smoke; a sixth could never bear the fire. \n At last they came to blows; and one of them, \n Shunning the sword, fell straight into the fire. \n And Antiphanes, in his Philotis, displaying the cleverness of the cooks,\n says\u2014 \n \n A. Is not this, then, an owl? B. Aye, such as I \n Say should be dress'd in brine. A. Well; and this\n pike \n \n B. Why roast him whole. A. \n This shark? B. Boil him in sauce. \n \n A. This eel? B. Take salt,\n and marjoram, and water. \n \n A. This conger? B. The same\n sauce will do for him. \n \n A. This ray? B. Strew him\n with herbs. A. Here is a slice \n Of tunny. B. Roast it. A. \n And some venison. B. Roast it. \n \n A. Then here's a lot more meat. B. Boil all the rest. \n \n A. Here's a spleen. B. Stuff\n it. A. And a nestis. B. \n Bah! \n This man will kill me. \n And Baton, in his Benefactors, gives a catalogue of celebrated cooks and\n confectioners, thus\u2014 \n \n A. Well, O Sibynna, we ne'er sleep at nights, \n Nor waste our time in laziness: our lamp \n Is always burning; in our hands a book; \n And long we meditate on what is left us \n By\u2014 B. Whom? A.

And Ep\u00e6netus, in his\n treatise on Cookery, speaks as follows:\u2014 One must make \u03bc\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1 of every kind of animal and bird, cutting up the tender\n parts of the meat into small pieces, and the bowels and \n entrails, and pounding the blood, and seasoning it with vinegar, and roasted\n cheese, and assaf\u0153tida, and cummin-seed, and thyme (both green and dry), and\n savory, and coriander-seed (both green and dry), and leeks, and onions (cleaned\n and toasted), and poppy-seed, and grapes, and honey, and the pips of an unripe\n pomegranate. You may also make this \u03bc\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1 of\n fish. \n \n ","82":"\n And when this man had thus hammered on not only this dish but our ears also,\n another slave came in, bringing in a dish called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7. And when a discussion arose about this, and when Ulpian had\n quoted a statement out of the Dictionary of Cookery by the before-mentioned\n Artemidorus relating to it, Aemilianus said that a book had been published by\n Dorotheus of Ascalon, entitled, On Antiphanes, and on the dish called Mattya by\n the Poets of the New Comedy, which he says is a Thessalian invention, and that it\n became naturalized at Athens during the supremacy of the Macedonians. And the\n Thessalians are admitted to be the most extravagant of all the Greeks in their\n manner of dressing and living; and this was the reason why they brought the\n Persians down upon the Greeks, because they were desirous to imitate their luxury\n and extravagance. And Cratinus speaks of their extravagant habits in his treatise\n on the Thessalian Constitution. But the dish was called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 (as Apollodorus the Athenian affirms in the first book of his\n treatise on Etymologies), from the verb \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \n (to eat); as also are the words \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03b7 (mastich)\n and \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1 (barley-cake). But our own opinion is\n that the word is derived from \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9, and that this\n is the verb from which \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1 itself is derived, and\n also the cheese-pudding called by the Cyprians \u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03c2; and from this, too, comes the verb \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03ac\u03c9, meaning to be extravagantly luxurious. Originally they\n used to call this common ordinary food made of barley-meal \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1, and preparing it they called \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9. And afterwards, varying the necessary food in a luxurious and\n superfluous manner, they derived a word with a slight change from the form\n \u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1, and called every very costly kind of dish\n \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7; and preparing such dishes they called\n \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03c5\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9, whether it were fish, or poultry, or\n herbs, or beasts or sweetmeats. And this is plain from the testimony of Ale is,\n quoted by Artemidorus; for Alexis, wishing to show the great luxuriousness of the\n way in which this dish was prepared, added the verb \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9. And the whole extract runs thus, being out of a corrected edition of a play which is entitled De- metrius:\u2014 \n Take, then, this meat which thus is sent to you; \n Dress it, and feast, and drink the cheerful healths, \n \n \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5, \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03c5\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5. \n \n But the Athenians use the verb \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \n for wanton and unseemly indulgence of the sensual appetites. \n ","83":"\n And Artemidorus, in his Dictionary of Cookery, explains \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 as a common name for all kinds of costly seasonings; writing\n thus\u2014 There is also a \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2 (he uses\n the word in the masculine gender) made of birds. Let the bird be killed by\n thrusting a knife into the head at the mouth; then let it be kept till the next\n day, like a partridge. And if you choose, you can leave it as it is, the wings\n on and with its body plucked. Then, having explained the way in which\n it is to be seasoned and boiled, he proceeds to say\u2014 Boil a fat hen of the\n common poultry kind, and some young cocks just beginning to crow, if you wish\n to make a dish fit to be eaten with your wine. Then taking some vegetables, put\n them in a dish, and place upon them some of the meat of the fowl, and serve it\n up. But in summer, instead of vinegar, put some unripe grapes into the sauce,\n just as they are picked from the vine; and when it is all boiled, then take it\n out before the stones fall from the grapes, and shred in some vegetables. And\n this is the most delicious \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2 that there\n is. \n \n Now, that \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7, or \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2, really is a common name for all costly dishes is plain; and\n that the same name was also given to a banquet composed of dishes of this sort, we\n gather from what Philemon says in his Man carried off:\u2014 \n Put now a guard on me, while naked, and \n Amid my cups the \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2 shall delight\n me. \n And in his Homicide he says\u2014 \n Let some one pour us now some wine to drink, \n And make some \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 quick. \n But Alexis, in his Pyraunus, has used the word in an obscure sense:\u2014\n \n But when I found them all immersed in business, \n I cried,\u2014Will no one give us now a \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7? \n \n as if he meant a feast here, though you might fairly refer the word\n merely to a single dish. Now Machon the Sicyonian is one of the comic poets who\n were contemporaries of Apollodorus of Carystus, but he did not exhibit his\n comedies at Athens, but in Alexandria; and he was an\n excellent poet, if ever there was one, next to those seven of\n the first class. On which account, Aristophanes the grammarian, when he was a very\n young man, was very anxious to be much with him. And he wrote the following lines\n in his play entitled Ignorance:\u2014 \n There's nothing that I'm fonder of than \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7; \n \n But whether 'twas the Macedonians \n Who first did teach it us, or all the gods, \n I know not; but it must have been a person \n Of most exalted genius. \n \n \n ","84":"\n And that it used to be served up after all the rest of the banquet was over, is\n plainly stated by Nicostratus, in his Man expelled. And it is a cook who is\n relating how beautiful and well arranged the banquet was which he prepared; and\n having first of all related what the dinner and supper were composed of, and then\n mentioning the third meal, proceeds to say\u2014 \n Well done, my men,\u2014extremely well! but now \n I will arrange the rest, and then the \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7; \n \n So that I think the man himself will never \n Find fault with us again. \n And in his Cook he says\u2014 \n Thrium and candylus he never saw, \n Or any of the things which make a \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7. \n \n And some one else says\u2014 \n They brought, instead of a \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7, some\n paunch, \n And tender pettitoes, and tripe, perhaps. \n But Dionysius, in his Man shot at with Javelins (and it is a cook who is\n represented speaking), says\u2014 \n So that sometimes, when I a \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 \n \n Was making for them, in haste would bring \n (More haste worse speed) . . . . . \n \n Philemon, also, in his Poor Woman\u2014 \n When one can lay aside one's load, all day \n Making and serving out rich \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9. \n \n But Molpis the Laced\u00e6monian says that what the Spartans call \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, that is to say, the second course, which is\n served up when the main part of the supper is over, is called \n \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03c5\u03b1\u03b9 by other tribes of Greece. And Menippus\n the Cynic, in his book called Arcesilaus, writes thus:\u2014 There was a drinking\n party formed by a certain number of revellers, and a Laced\u00e6monian woman ordered\n the \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 to be served up; and immediately\n some little partridges were brought in, and some roasted geese, and some\n delicious cheesecakes. \n \n But such a course as this the Athenians used to call \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, and the Dorians \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03ca\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd; but most of the Greeks called it \u03c4\u1f70\n \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1. \n \n And when all this discussion about the \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03cd\u03b7 was\n over, they thought it time to depart; for it was already evening.

For who is there\n of us who does not know that this kind of \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2 was not that of the ancients? unless you think that\n the cottabus-players of Ameipsias vomited. Since, then, you are ignorant of what\n this is which is the subject of our present discussion, learn from me, in the\n first place, that the cottabus is a sport of Sicilian invention, the Sicilians\n having been the original contrivers of it, as Critias the son of Call\u00e6schrus tells\n us in his Elegies, where he says\u2014 \n The cottabus comes from Sicilian lands, \n And a glorious invention I think it, \n Where we put up a target to shoot at with drops \n From our wine-cup whenever we drink it. \n And Dic\u00e6archus the Messenian, the pupil of Aristotle, in his treatise on Alc\u00e6us, says that the word \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7 is also a Sicilian noun. But \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7 means the drops which are left in the bottom after the cup is\n drained, and which the players used to throw with inverted hand into the \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd. But Clitarchus, in his treatise on Words,\n says that the Thessalians and Rhodians both call the \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 itself, or splash made by the cups, \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7. \n \n ","2":"\n The prize also which was proposed for those who gained the victory in drinking was\n called \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, as Euripides shows us in his\n \u0152neus, where he says\u2014 \n And then with many a dart of Bacchus' juice, \n They struck the old man's head. And I was set \n To crown the victor with deserved reward, \n And give the cottabus to such. \n The vessel, too, into which they threw the drops was also called \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, as Cratinus shows in his Nemesis. But Plato\n the comic poet, in his Jupiter Ill-treated, makes out that the cottabus was a sort\n of drunken game, in which those who were defeated yielded up their tools to the victor. And these\n are his words\u2014 \n \n A. I wish you all to play at cottabus \n While I am here preparing you your supper. \n * * * * * * * * \n Bring, too, some balls to play with, quick,-some balls, \n And draw some water, and bring round some cups. \n \n B. Now let us play for kisses. \n A. No; such games \n I never suffer. \n I challenge you all to play the cottabus, \n And for the prizes, here are these new slippers \n Which she doth wear, and this your cotylus. \n \n B. A mighty game! This is a greater contest \n Than e'en the Isthmian festival can furnish. \n \n \n ","3":"\n There was a kind of cottabus also which they used to call \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, that is, when lamps are lifted up and then let down again.\n Eubulus, in his Bellerophon, says\u2014 \n Who now will take hold of my leg below? \n For I am lifted up like a \u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n And Antiphanes, in his Birthday of Venus, says\u2014 \n \n A. This now is what I mean; don't you perceive \n This lamp's the cottabus: attend awhile; \n The eggs, and sweetmeats, and confectionery \n Are the prize of victory. B. Sure you will play \n \n For a most laughable prize. How shall you do? \n \n A. I then will show you how: whoever throws \n The cottabus direct against the scale ( \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03be ), \n So as to make it fall\u2014\u2014 B. What scale? Do you \n Mean this small dish which here is placed above? \n \n A. That is the scale\u2014he is the conqueror. \n \n B. How shall a man know this? A. Why, if he throw \n So as to reach it barely, it will fall \n Upon the manes, and there'll be great noise. \n \n B. Does manes, then, watch o'er the cottabus, \n As if he were a slave? \n And in a subsequent passage he says\u2014 \n \n B. Just take the cup and show me how 'tis done. \n \n A. Now bend your fingers like a flute-player, \n Pour in a little wine, and not too much, \n Then throw it. B. How? A. \n Look here; throw it like this \n \n B. O mighty Neptune, what a height he throws it! \n \n A. Now do the same. B. Not even with a sling \n Could I throw such a distance. A. Well, but\n learn. \n \n \n ","4":"\n For a man must curve his hand excessively before he can throw the cottabus\n elegantly, as Dic\u00e6archus says; and Plato intimates as much in his Jupiter\n Ill-treated, where some one calls out to Hercules not to hold his hand too stiff,\n when he is going to play the cottabus. They also called the very act of throwing\n the cottabus \u1f00\u03c0\u02bc \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, because they curved\n ( \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c9 ) the right hand in throwing it.\n Though some say that \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7, in this phrase, means\n a kind of cup. And Bacchylides, in his Love Poems, says\u2014 \n And when she throws \u1f00\u03c0\u02bc \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \n \n Displaying to the youths her snow-white arm. \n And Aeschylus, in his Bone Gatherers, speaks of \u1f00\u03b4\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9, saying\u2014 \n Eurymachus, and no one else, did heap \n No slighter insults, undeserved, upon me; \n For my head always was his mark at which \n To throw his cottabus . . . . . \n \n Now, that he who succeeded in throwing the cottabus properly received a\n prize, Antiphanes has shown us in a passage already quoted. And the prize\n consisted of eggs, sweetmeats, and confectionery. And Cephisodorus, in his\n Trohonius, and Callias or Diocles, in the Cyclopes,\n (whichever of the two is the author,) and Eupolis, and Hermippus, in his Iambics,\n prove the same thing. \n Now what is called the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 cottabus was\n something of this kind. There is a high lamp, having on it what is called the\n Manes, on which the dish, when thrown down, ought to fall; and from thence it\n falls into the platter which lies below, and which is struck by the cottabus. And\n there was room for very great dexterity in throwing the cottabus. And Nicochares\n speaks of the Manes in his Laced\u00e6monians. \n ","5":"\n There is also another way of playing this game with a platter. This platter is\n filled with water, and in it there are floating some empty saucers, at which the\n players throw their drops out of their cups, and endeavour to sink them. And he\n who has succeeded in sinking the greatest number gains the victory. Ameipsias, in\n his play entitled The Men playing at the Cottabus or Mania, says\u2014 \n Bring here the cruets and the cups at once, \n The foot-pan, too, but first pour in some water. \n And Cratinus, in his Nemesis, says\u2014 \n Now in the cottabus I challenge you, \n (As is my country's mode,) to aim your blows \n At the empty cruets; and he who sinks the most \n Shall, in my judgment, bear the palm of victory. \n And Aristophanes, in his Feasters, says\u2014 \n I mean to erect a brazen figure, \n That is, a cottabeum, and myrtle-berries. \n And Hermippus, in his Fates, says\u2014 \n Now soft cloaks are thrown away, \n Every one clasps on his breastplate, \n And binds his greaves around his legs, \n No one for snow-white slippers cares; \n Now you may see the cottabus staff \n Thrown carelessly among the chaff; \n The manes hears no falling drops; \n And you the \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03be sad may see \n Thrown on the dunghill at the garden door. \n And Ach\u00e6us, in his Linus, speaking of the Satyrs, says\u2014 \n Throwing, and dropping, breaking, too, and naming ( \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ), \n O Hercules, the well-thrown drop of wine! \n And the poet uses \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 here, because\n they used to utter the names of their sweethearts as they threw the cottabi on the\n saucers. On which account Sophocles, in his Inachus, called the drops which were\n thrown, sacred to Venus\u2014 \n \n The golden-colour'd drop of Venus \n Descends on all the houses. \n And Euripides, in his Pleisthenes, says\u2014 \n And the loud noise o' the frequent cottabus \n Awakens melodies akin to Venus \n In every house. \n And Callimachus says\u2014 \n Many hard drinkers, lovers of Acontius, \n Throw on the ground the wine-drops ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 )\n from their cups. \n \n \n ","6":"\n There was also another kind of way of playing at the cottabus, in the feasts which\n lasted all night, which is mentioned by Callippus in his Festival lasting all\n Night, where he says\u2014 \n And he who keeps awake all night shall have \n A cheesecake for his prize of victory, \n And kiss whoe'er he pleases of the girls \n Who are at hand. \n There were also sweetmeats at these nocturnal festivals, in which the men\n continued awake an extraordinary time dancing. And these sweetmeats used to be\n called at that time \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, from the joy\n ( \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 ) of those who received them. And Eubulus,\n in his Ancylion, mentions them, speaking as follows\u2014 \n For he has long been cooking prizes for \n The victors in the cottabus. \n And presently afterwards he says\u2014 \n I then sprang out to cook the \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u0301\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n But that kisses were also given as the prize Eubulus tells us in a\n subsequent passage\u2014 \n Come now, ye women, come and dance all night, \n This is the tenth day since my son was born; \n And I will give three fillets for the prize, \n And five fine apples, and nine kisses too. \n But that the cottabus was a sport to which the Sicilians were greatly\n addicted is plain from the fact that they had rooms built adapted to the game;\n which Dic\u00e6archus, in his treatise on Alc\u00e6us, states to have been the case. So that\n it was not without reason that Callimachus affixed the epithet of Sicilian to\n \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03be. And Dionysius, who was surnamed the\n Brazen, mentions both the \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2 and the \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 in his Elegies, where he says\u2014 \n Here we, unhappy in our loves, establish \n This third addition to the games of Bacchus, \n \n That the glad cottabus shall now be play'd \n In honour of you, a most noble quintain\u2014 \n All you who here are present twine your hands, \n Holding the ball-shaped portion of your cups, \n And, ere you let it go, let your eyes scan \n The heaven that bends above you; watching well \n How great a space your \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2 may\n cover. \n \n \n ","7":"\n After this, Ulpian demanded a larger goblet to drink out of quoting these lines\n out of the same collection of Elegies\u2014 \n Pouring forth hymns to you and me propitious, \n Let us now send your ancient friend from far, \n With the swift rowing of our tongues and praises, \n To lofty glory while this banquet lasts; \n And the quick genius of Ph\u00e6acian eloquence \n Commands the Muses' crew to man the benches. \n For let us be guided by the younger Cratinus, who says in his Omphale\u2014\n \n It suits a happy man to stay at home \n And drink, let others wars and labours love. \n In answer to whom Cynulcus, who was always ready for a tilt at the\n Syrian, and who never let the quarrel drop which he had against him, now that\n there was a sort of tumult in the party, said-What is this chorus of\n Syrbenians? \n And I myself also recollect some lines of this poetry, which I will quote, that\n Ulpian may not give himself airs as being the only one who was able to extract\n anything about the cottabus out of those old stores of the Homerid\u00e6\u2014 \n Come now and hear this my auspicious message, \n And end the quarrels which your cups engender; \n Turn your attention to these words of mine, \n And learn these lessons. . . . . . . . . \n which have a clear reference to the present discussion. For I see the\n servants now bringing us garlands and perfumes. Why now are those who are crowned\n said to be in love when their crowns are broken? For when I was a boy, and when I\n used to read the Epigrams of Callimachus, in which this is one of the topics\n dilated on, I was anxious to understand this point. For the poet of Cyrene says\u2014\n \n And all the roses, when the leaves fell off \n From the man's garlands, on the ground were thrown. \n So now it is your business, you most accomplished man, to explain this\n difficulty which has occupied me these thousand years, O\n Democritus, and to tell me why lovers crown the doors of their mistresses. \n ","8":"\n And Democritus replied\u2014But that I may quote some of the verses of this Brazen poet\n and orator Dionysius, (and he was called Brazen because he advised the Athe- nians\n to adopt a brazen coinage; and Callimachus mentions the oration in his list of\n Oratorical Performances,) I myself will cite some lines out of his Elegies. And do\n you, O Theodorus, for this is your proper name\u2014 \n Receive these first-fruits of my poetry, \n Given you as a pledge; and as an omen \n Of happy fortune I send first to you \n This offering of the Graces, deeply studied,\u2014 \n Take it, requiting me with tuneful verse, \n Fit ornament of feasts, and emblem of your happiness. \n You ask, then, why, if the garlands of men who have been crowned are\n pulled to pieces, they are said to be in love.\" Is it, since love takes away the\n strict regularity of manners in the case of lovers, that on this account they\n think the loss of a conspicuous ornament, a sort of beacon (as Clearchus says, in\n the first book of his Art of Love) and signal, that they to whom this has happened\n have lost the strict decorum of their manners? Or do men interpret this\n circumstance also by divination, as they do many other things? For the ornament of\n a crown, as there is nothing lasting in it, is a sort of emblem of a passion which\n does not endure, but assumes a specious appearance for a while: and such a passion\n is love. For no people are more careful to study appearance than those who are in\n love. Unless, perhaps, nature, as a sort of god, administering everything with\n justice and equity, thinks that lovers ought not to be crowned till they have\n subdued their love; that is to say, till, having prevailed upon the object of\n their love, they are released from their desire. And accordingly, the loss of\n their crown we make the token of their being still occupied in the fields of love.\n Or perhaps Love himself, not permitting any one to be crowned in opposition to, or\n to be proclaimed as victor over himself, takes their crowns from these men, and\n gives the perception of this to others, indicating that these men are subdued by\n him: on which account all the rest say that these men are in love. Or is it\n because that cannot be loosed which has never been bound, but love is the chain of\n some who wear crowns, (for no one else who is bound is\n more anxious about being crowned than a lover,) that men consider that the loosing\n of the garland is a sign of love, and therefore say that these men are in love? Or\n is it because very often lovers, when they have been crowned, often out of\n agitation as it should seem, allow their crowns to fall to pieces, and so we argue\n backwards, and attribute this passion to all whom we see in this predicament;\n thinking that their crown never would have come to pieces, if they had not been in\n love? Or is it because these loosings happen only in the case of men bound or men\n in love; and so, men thinking that the loosing of the garland is the loosing also\n of those who are bound, con- sider that such men are in love? For those in love\n are bound, unless you would rather say that, because those who are in love are\n crowned with love, therefore their crown is not of a lasting kind; for it is\n difficult to put a small and ordinary kind of crown on a large and divine one. Men\n also crown the doors of the houses of the objects of their love, either with a\n view to do them honour, as they adorn with crowns the vestibule of some god to do\n him honour: or perhaps the offering of the crowns is made, not to the beloved\n objects, but to the god Love. For thinking the beloved object the statue, as it\n were, of Love, and his house the temple of Love, they, under this idea, adorn with\n crowns the vestibules of those whom they love. And for the same reason some people\n even sacri- fice at the doors of those whom they love. Or shall we rather say that\n people who fancy that they are deprived, or who really have been deprived of the\n ornament of their soul, consecrate to those who have deprived them of it, the\n orna- ment also of their body, being bewildered by their passion, and despoiling\n themselves in order to do so? And every one who is in love does this when the\n object of his love is present, but when he is not present, then he makes this\n offering in the public roads. On which account Lycophronides has re- presented\n that goatherd in love, as saying\u2014 \n I consecrate this rose to you, \n A beautiful idea; \n This cap, and eke these sandals too, \n And this good hunting-spear: \n For now my mind is gone astray, \n Wandering another way, \n Towards that girl of lovely face, \n Favourite of ev'ry Grace.\" \n \n \n \n ","9":"\n Moreover, that most divine writer Plato, in the seventh book of his Laws, proposes\n a problem having reference to crowns, which it is worth while to solve; and these\n are the words of the philosopher:\u2014 Let there be distributions of apples and\n crowns to a greater and a lesser number of people, in such a way that the\n numbers shall always be equal. These are the words of Plato. But what\n he means is something of this sort. He wishes to find one number of such a nature\n that, if divided among all who come in to the very last, it shall give an equal\n number of apples or crowns to every one. I say, then, that the number sixty will\n fulfil these conditions of equality in the case of six fellow-feasters; for I am\n aware that at the beginning we said that a supper party ought not to consist of\n more than five. But we are as numerous as the sand of the sea. Accordingly the\n number sixty, when the party is completed to the number of six guests, will begin\n to be divided in this manner. The first man came into the banqueting room, and\n received sixty garlands. He gives to the second who comes in half of them; and\n then each of them have thirty. Then when a third comes in they divide the whole\n sixty, so that each of them may have twenty. Again, they divide them again in like\n manner at the entrance of a fourth guest, so that each has fifteen; and when a\n fifth comes in they all have twelve a-piece. And when the sixth guest arrives,\n they divide them again, and each individual has ten. And in this way the equal\n division of the garlands is accomplished. \n ","10":"\n When Democritus had said this, Ulpian, looking towards Cynulcus, said\u2014 \n To what a great philosopher has Fate \n Now join'd me here! \n As Theognetus the comic poet says, in his Apparition,\u2014 \n You wretched man, you've learnt left-handed letters, \n Your reading has perverted your whole life; \n Philosophising thus with earth and heaven, \n Though neither care a bit for all your speeches. \n For where was it that you got that idea of the Chorus of the Syrbenians?\n What author worth speaking of mentions that musical chorus? And he replied:\u2014My\n good friend, I will not teach you, unless I first receive adequate pay from you;\n for I do not read to pick out all the thorns out of my books as you do, but I\n select only what is most useful and best worth hearing. And\n at this Ulpian got indignant, and roared out these lines out of the Suspicion of\n Alexis\u2014 \n These things are shameful, e'en to the Triballi; \n Where they do say a man who sacrifices, \n Displays the feast to the invited guests, \n And then next day, when they are hungry all, \n Sells them what he'd invited them to see. \n And the same iambics occur in the Sleep of Antiphanes. And Cynulcus\n said:\u2014Since there have already been discussions about garlands, tell us, my good\n Ulpian, what is the meaning of the expression, The garland of\n Naucratis, in the beautiful poet Anacreon. For that sweet minstrel\n says\u2014 \n And each man three garlands had: \n Two of roses fairly twined, \n And the third a Naucratite. \n And why also does the same poet represent some people as crowned with\n osiers? for in the second book of his Odes, he says\u2014 \n But now full twice five months are gone \n Since kind Megisthes wore a crown \n Of pliant osier, drinking wine \n Whose colour did like rubies shine. \n For to suppose that these crowns were really made of osiers is absurd,\n for the osier is fit only for plaiting and binding. So now tell us about these\n things, my friend, for they are worth understanding correctly, and do not keep us\n quibbling about words. \n ","11":"\n But as he made no reply, and pretended to be considering the matter, Democritus\n said:\u2014Aristarchus the gram- marian, my friend, when interpreting this passage,\n said that the ancients used to wear crowns of willow. But Tenarus says that the\n willow or osier is the rustics' crown. And other interpreters have said many\n irrelevant things on the subject. But I, having met with a book of Menodotus of\n Samos, which is entitled, A Record of the things worth noting at Samos, found\n there what I was looking for; for he says that \"Admete, the wife of Eurystheus,\n after she had fled from Argos, came to Samos, and there, when a vision of Juno had\n appeared to her, she wishing to give the goddess a reward because she had arrived\n in Samos from her own home in safety, undertook the care of the temple, which\n exists even to this day, and which had been originally built by the Leleges and\n the Nymphs. But the Argives hearing of this, and being\n indignant at it, persuaded the Tyrrhenians by a promise of money, to employ\n piratical force and to carry off the statue,\u2014the Argives believing that if this\n were done Admete would be treated with every possible severity by the inhabitants\n of Samos. Accordingly the Tyrrhenians came to the port of Juno, and having\n disembarked, immediately applied themselves to the performance of their\n undertaking. And as the temple was at that time without any doors, they quickly\n carried off the statue, and bore it down to the seaside, and put it on board their\n vessel. And when they had loosed their cables and weighed anchor, they rowed as\n fast as they could, but were unable to make any progress. And then, thinking that\n this was owing to divine interposition, they took the statue out of the ship again\n and put it on the shore; and having made some sacrificial cakes, and offered them\n to it, they departed in great fear. But when, the first thing in the morning,\n Admete gave notice that the statue had disappeared, and a search was made for it,\n those who were seeking it found it on the shore. And they, like Carian barbarians,\n as they were, thinking that the statue had run away of its own accord, bound it to\n a fence made of osiers, and took all the longest branches on each side and twined\n them round the body of the statue, so as to envelop it all round. But Admete\n released the statue from these bonds, and purified it, and placed it again on its\n pedestal, as it had stood before. And on this account once every year, since that\n time, the statue is carried down to the shore and hidden, and cakes are offered to\n it: and the festival is called \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2, because it\n happened that the statue was bound tightly ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2 ) by those who made the first search for it. \n ","12":"\n \"But they relate that about that time the Carians, being overwhelmed with\n superstitious fears, came to the oracle of the god at Hybla, and consulted him\n with reference \"O these occurrences; and that Apollo told them that they must give\n a voluntary satisfaction to the god of their own accord, to escape a more serious\n calamity,\u2014such as in former times Jupiter had inflicted upon Prometheus, because\n of his theft of the fire, after he had released him from a most terrible\n captivity. And as he was inclined to give a satisfaction which should not cause\n him severe pain, this was what the god imposed upon him. And\n from this circumstance the use of this kind of crown which had been shown to\n Prometheus got common among the rest of mankind who had been benefited by him by\n his gift of fire: on which account the god enjoined the Carians also to adopt a\n similar custom,\u2014to use osiers as a garland, and bind their heads with the branches\n with which they themselves had bound the goddess. And he ordered them also to\n abandon the use of every other kind of garland except that made of the bay-tree:\n and that tree he said he gave as a gift to those alone who are employed in the\n service of the goddess. And he told them that, if they obeyed the injunctions\n given them by the oracle, and if in their banquets they paid the goddess the\n satisfaction to which she was entitled, they should be protected from injury: on\n which account the Carians, wishing to obey the commands laid on them by the\n oracle, abolished the use of those garlands which they had previously been\n accustomed to wear, but permitted all those who were employed in the service of\n the goddess still to wear the garland of bay-tree, which remains in use even to\n this day. \n ","13":"\n \"Nic$enetus also, the epic poet, appears to make some allusion to the fashion of\n wearing garlands of osier in his Epigrams. And this poet was a native of Samos,\n and a man who in numberless passages shows his fondness for mentioning points\n connected with the history of his country. And these are his words:\u2014 \n I am not oft, O Philotherus, fond \n Of feasting in the city, but prefer \n The country, where the open breeze of zephyr \n Freshens my heart; a simple bed \n Beneath my body is enough for me, \n Made of the branches of the native willow ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ), \n And osier ( \u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ), ancient garland of the\n Carians,\u2014 \n But let good wine be brought, and the sweet lyre, \n Chief ornament of the Pierian sisters, \n That we may drink our fill, and sing the praise \n Of the all-glorious bride of mighty Jove, \n The great protecting queen of this our isle. \n But in the selines Nic\u00e6netus speaks ambiguously, for it is not quite\n plain whether he means that the osier is to make his bed or his garland; though\n afterwards, when he calls it the ancient garland of the Carians, he alludes\n clearly enough to what we are now discussing. And this use of osiers to make into garlands, lasted in that island down to the time of\n Polycrates, as we may conjecture. At all events Anacreon says\u2014 \n But now full twice five months are gone \n Since kind Megisthes wore a crown \n Of pliant osier, drinking wine \n Whose colour did like rubies shine.\" \n \n \n ","14":"\n And the Gods know that I first found all this out in the beautiful city of\n Alexandria, having got possession of the treatise of Menodotus, in which I showed\n to many people the passage in Anacreon which is the subject of discussion. But\n Heph\u00e6stion, who is always charging every one else with thefts, took this solution\n of mine, and claimed it as his own, and published an essay, to which he gave this\n title, Concerning the Osier Garland mentioned by Anacreon. And a\n copy of this essay we lately found at Rome in the possession of the antiquary\n Demetrius. And this compiler Heph\u00e6stion behaved in the same way to our excellent\n friend Adrantus. For after he had published a treatise in five books, Concerning\n those Matters in Theophrastus in his books on Manners, which are open to any\n Dispute, either as to their Facts, or the Style in which they are mentioned; and\n had added a sixth book Concerning the Disputable Points in the Nicomachean Ethics\n of Aristotle; and in these books had entered into a long dissertation on the\n mention of Plexippus by Antipho the tragic poet, and had also said a good deal\n about Antipho himself; Heph\u00e6stion, I say, appropriated all these books to himself,\n and wrote another book, Concerning the Mention of Antipho in the Memorabilia of\n Xenophon, not having added a single discovery or original observation of his own,\n any more than he had in the discussion on the Osier Garland. For the only thing he\n said that was new, was that Phylarchus, in the seventh book of his Histories,\n mentioned this story about the osier, and knew nothing of the passage of\n Nic\u00e6netus, nor of that of Anacreon; and he showed that he differed in some\n respects from the account that had been given by Menodotus. \n But one may explain this fact of the osier garlands more simply, by saying that\n Megisthes wore a garland of osier because there was a great quantity of those\n trees in the place where he was feasting; and therefore he used it to bind his temples. For the Laced\u00e6monians at the festival of the\n Promachia, wear garlands of reeds, as Sosibius tells us in his treatise on the\n Sacrificial Festivals at Laced\u00e6mon, where he writes thus: On this festival\n the natives of the country all wear garlands of reeds, or tiaras, but the boys\n who have been brought up in the public school follow without any garland at\n all. \n \n ","15":"\n But Aristotle, in the second book of his treatise on Love Affairs, and Ariston the\n Peripatetic, who was a native of Ceos, in the second book of his Amatory\n Resemblances, say that The ancients, on account of the headaches which were\n produced by their wine-drinking, adopted the practice of wearing garlands made\n of anything which came to hand, as the binding the head tight appeared to be of\n service to them. But men in later times added also some ornaments to their\n temples, which had a kind of reference to their employment of drinking, and so\n they invented garlands in the present fashion. But it is more reasonable to\n suppose that it was because the head is the seat of all sensation that men wore\n crowns upon it, than that they did so because it was desirable to have their\n temples shaded and bound as a remedy against the headaches produced by\n wine. \n \n They also wore garlands over their foreheads, as the sweet Anacreon says\u2014 \n And placing on our brows fresh parsley crowns, \n Let's honour Bacchus with a jovial feast. \n They also wore garlands on their breasts, and anointed them with perfume,\n because that is the seat of the heart. And they call the garlands which they put\n round their necks \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, as Alc\u00e6us does in\n these lines\u2014 \n Let every one twine round his neck \n Wreathed \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 of anise. \n And Sappho says\u2014 \n And wreathed \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \n \n In numbers round their tender throats. \n And Anacreon says\u2014 \n They placed upon their bosoms lotus flowers \n Entwined in fragrant \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n Aeschylus also, in his Prometheus Unbound, says distinctly\u2014 \n And therefore we, in honour of Prometheus, \n Place garlands on our heads, a poor atonement \n For the sad chains with which his limbs were bound. \n \n And again, in the play entitled the Sphinx, he says- \n Give the stranger a \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (garland), the\n ancient \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, \u2014 \n This is the best of chains, as we may judge \n From great Prometheus. \n But Sappho gives a more simple reason for our wearing garlands, speaking\n as follows\u2014 \n But place those garlands on thy lovely hair, \n Twining the tender sprouts of anise green \n With skilful hand; for offerings of flowers \n Are pleasing to the gods, who hate all those \n Who come before them with uncrowned heads. \n In which lines she enjoins all who offer sacrifice to wear garlands on\n their heads, as they are beautiful things, and acceptable to the Gods. Aristotle\n also, in his Banquet, says, We never offer any mutilated gift to the Gods,\n but only such as are perfect and entire; and what is full is entire, and\n crowning anything indicates filling it in some sort. So Homer says\u2014 \n \n \n The slaves the goblets crown'd with rosy wine; \n \n Iliad, i. 470. \n \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n \n \n But God plain forms with eloquence does crown. \n \n Odyss. viii. 170. \n \n That is to say, eloquence in speaking makes up in the case of some men\n for their personal ugliness. Now this is what the \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 seems intended to do, on which account, in times of\n mourning, we do exactly the contrary. For wishing to testify our sympathy for\n the dead, we mutilate ourselves by cutting our hair, and by putting aside our\n garlands. \n \n ","16":"\n Now Philonides the physician, in his treatise on Ointments and Garlands, says,\n \"After the vine was introduced into Greece from the Red Sea, and when most people\n had become addicted to intemperate enjoyment, and had learnt to drink unmixed\n wine, some of them became quite frantic and out of their minds, while others got\n so stupified as to resemble the dead. And once, when some men were drinking on the\n sea-shore, a violent shower came on, and broke up the party, and filled the\n goblet, which had a little wine left in it, with water. But when it became fine\n again, the men returned to the same spot, and tasting the new mixture, found that\n their enjoyment was now not only exquisite, but free from any subsequent pain. And\n on this account, the Greeks invoke the good Deity at the cup\n of unmixed wine, which is served round to them at dinner, paying honour to the\n Deity who invented wine; and that was Bacchus. But when the first cup of mixed\n wine is handed round after dinner, they then invoke Jupiter the Saviour, thinking\n him the cause of this mixture of wine which is so unattended with pain, as being\n the author of rain. Now, those who suffered in their heads after drinking,\n certainly stood in need of some remedy; and so the binding their heads was what\n most readily occurred to them, as Nature herself led them to this remedy. For a\n certain man having a headache, as Andreas says, pressed his head, and found\n relief, and so invented a ligature as a remedy for headache. \n Accordingly, men using these ligatures as assistants in drinking, used to bind\n their heads with whatever came in their way. And first of all, they took garlands\n of ivy, which offered itself, as it were, of its own accord, and was very\n plentiful, and grew everywhere, and was pleasant to look upon, shading the\n forehead with its green leaves and bunches of berries, and bearing a good deal of\n tension, so as to admit of being bound tight across the brow, and imparting also a\n certain degree of coolness without any stupifying smell accompanying it. And it\n seems to me that this is the reason why men have agreed to consider the garland of\n ivy sacred to Bacchus, implying by this that the inventor of wine is also the\n defender of men from all the inconveniences which arise from the use of it. And\n from thence, regarding chiefly pleasure, and considering utility and the comfort\n of the relief from the effects of drunkenness of less importance, they were\n influenced chiefly by what was agreeable to the sight or to the smell. And\n therefore they adopted crowns of myrtle, which has exciting properties, and which\n also represses any rising of the fumes of wine; and garlands of roses, which to a\n certain extent relieve headache, and also impart some degree of coolness; and\n garlands also of bay leaves, which they think are not wholly unconnected with\n drinking parties. But garlands of white lilies, which have an effect on, the head,\n and wreaths of amaracus, or of any other flower or herb which has any tendency to\n produce heaviness or torpid feelings in the head, must be avoided.\" And\n Apollodorus, in his treatise on Perfumes and Garlands, has\n said the same thing in the very same words. And this, my friends, is enough to say\n on this subject. \n ","17":"\n But concerning the Naucratite Crown, and what kind of flowers that is made of, I\n made many investigations, and inquired a great deal without learning anything,\n till at last I fell in with a book of Polycharmus of Naucratis, entitled On Venus,\n in which I found the following passage: \u2014 But in the twenty-third Olympiad\n Herostratus, a fellow-countryman of mine, who was a merchant, and as such had\n sailed to a great many different countries, coming by chance to Paphos, in\n Cyprus, bought an image of Venus, a span high, of very ancient workmanship, and\n came away meaning to bring it to Naucratis. And as he was sailing near the,\n Egyptian coast, a violent storm suddenly overtook him, and the sailors could\n not tell where they were, and so they all had recourse to this image of Venus,\n entreating her to save them. And the goddess, for she was kindly disposed\n towards the men of Naucratis, on a sudden filled all the space near her with\n branches of green myrtle, and diffused a most delicious odor over the whole\n ship, when all the sailors had previously despaired of safety from their\n violent sea-sickness. And after they had been all very sick, the sun shone out,\n and they, Seeing the landmarks, came in safety into Naucratis. And Herostratus\n having disembarked from the ship with his image, and carrying with him also the\n green branches of myrtle which had so suddenly appeared to him, consecrated it\n and them in the temple of Venus. And having sacrificed to the gooddess, and\n having consecrated the image to Venus, and invited all his relations and most\n intimate friends to a banquet in the temple, he gave every one of them a\n garland of these branches of myrtle, to which garlands he then gave the name of\n Naucratite. This is the account given by Polcharmus; and I myself\n believe the statement, and believe that the Naucratite garland is no other than\n one made of myrtle, especially as in Anacreon it is represented as worn with one\n made of roses. And Philonides has said that the garland made of myrtle acts as a\n check upon the fumes of wine, and that the one made of roses, in addition to its\n cooling qualities, is to a certain extent a remedy for headache. And, therefore,\n those men are only to be laughed at, who say that the Naucratite garland is the\n wreath made of what is called by the Egyptians biblus,\n quoting the statement of Theopompus, in the third book of his History of Greece,\n where he says, That when Agesilaus the Laced\u00e6monian arrived in Egypt, the\n Egyptians sent him many presents, and among them the papyrus, which is used for\n making garlands. But I do not know what pleasure or advantage there\n could be in having a crown made of biblus with roses, unless people who are\n enamoured of such a wreath as this should also take a fancy to wear crowns of\n garlic and roses together. But I know that a great many people say that the\n garland made of the sampsychon or amaracus is the Naucratite garland; and this\n plant is very plentiful in Egypt, but the myrtle in Egypt is superior in sweetness\n to that which is found in any other country, as Theophrastus relates in another\n place. \n ","18":"\n While this discussion was going on, some slaves came in bringing garlands made of\n such flowers as were in bloom at the time; and Myrtilus said;\u2014Tell me, my good\n friend Ulpian, the different names of garlands. For these servants, as is said in\n the Centaur of Ch\u00e6rephon\u2014 \n Make ready garlands which they give the gods, \n Praying they may be heralds of good omen. \n And the same poet says, in his play entitled Bacchus\u2014 \n Cutting sweet garlands, messengers of good omen. \n Do not, however, quote to me passages out of the Crowns of Aelius\n Asclepiades, as if I were unacquainted with that work; but say something now\n besides what you find there. For you cannot show me that any one has ever spoken\n separately of a garland of roses, and a garland of violets. For as for the\n expression in Cratinus\u2014 \n \n \u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \n \n that is said in a joke. \n And he, laughing, replied,\u2014The word \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 was\n first used among the Greeks, as Semos the Delian tells us in the fourth book of\n his Delias, in the same sense as the word \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \n is used by us, which, however, by some people is called \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1. On which account, being first crowned with this \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, afterwards we put on a garland of bay leaves;\n and the word \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 itself is derived from the\n verb \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03c9, to crown. But do you, you loquacious\n Thessalian, think, says he, that I am going to repeat any of those old and\n hacknied stories? But because of your tongue ( \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 ), I will mention the \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2, which Plato speaks of in his Jupiter Ill-treated\u2014 \n But you wear leather tongues within your shoes, \n And crown yourselves with \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \n \n Whenever you're engaged in drinking parties. \n And when you sacrifice you speak only words \n Of happy omen. \n And Theodorus, in his Attic Words, as Pamphilus says in his treatise on\n Names, says, that the \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 is a species of\n plaited crown. Take this then from me; for, as Euripides says, \n 'Tis no hard work to argue on either side, \n If a man's only an adept at speaking. \n \n \n ","19":"\n There is the Isthmiacum also, and there was a kind of crown bearing this name,\n which Aristophanes has thought worthy of mention in his Fryers, where he speaks\n thus\u2014 \n What then are we to do? We should have taken \n A white cloak each of us; and then entwining \n Isthmiaca on our brows, like choruses, \n Come let us sing the eulogy of our master. \n But Silenus, in his Dialects, says, The Isthmian garland. \n And Philetas says, \n \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. There is an ambiguity here as to\n whether it refers to the head or to the main world. We also use the word \u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, as applied to a well, or to a dagger. But\n Timachidas and Simmias, who are both Rhodians, explain one word by the other. They\n say, \u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd : and this word is also\n mentioned by Callixenus, who is himself also a Rhodian, in his History of\n Alexandria, where he writes as follows\u2014 \n * * * * * * \n \n \n ","20":"\n But since I have mentioned Alexandria, I know that in that beautiful city there is\n a garland called the garland of Antinous, which is made of the lotus, which grows\n in those parts. And this lotus grows in the marshes in the summer season; and it\n bears flowers of two colours; one like that of the rose, and it is the garlands\n woven of the flower of this colour which are properly called the garlands of\n Antinous; but the other kind is called the lotus garland, being of a dark colour.\n And a man of the name of Pancrates, a native poet, with whom we ourselves were\n acquainted, made a great parade of showing a rose-coloured lotus to Adrian the\n emperor, when he was staying at Alexandria, saying, that he\n ought to give this flower the name of the Flower of Antinous, as having sprung\n from the ground where it drank in the blood of the Mauritanian lion, which Hadrian\n killed when he was out hunting in that part of Africa, near Alexandria; a\n monstrous beast which had ravaged all Libya for a long time, so as to make a very\n great part of the district desolate. Accordingly, Hadrian being delighted with the\n utility of the invention, and also with its novelty, granted to the poet that he\n should be maintained for the future in the Museum at the public expense; and\n Cratinus the comic poet, in his Ulysseses, has called the lotus \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1, because all plants which are full of leaf,\n are called \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 by the Athenians. But\n Pancrates said, with a good deal of neatness, in his poem\u2014 \n The crisp ground thyme, the snow-white lily too, \n The purple hyacinth, and the modest leaves \n Of the white celandine, and the fragrant rose, \n Whose petals open to the vernal zephyrs; \n For that fair flower which bears Antinous' name \n The earth had not yet borne. \n \n \n ","21":"\n There is the word \u03c0\u03c5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd. And this is the name\n given to the garland which the Laced\u00e6monians place on the head of Juno, as\n Pamphilus relates. \n I am aware, also, that there is a kind of garland, which is called \u02bc\u1f30\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c2 by the Sicyonians, as Timachidas mentions in his\n treatise on Dialects. And Philetas writes as follows:\u2014 \n \u02bc\u1f30\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1 \u2014this is a name given to a fragrant\n garland in the district of Sicyon\u2014 \n She stood by her sire, and in her fragrant hair \n She wore the beautiful Iacchian garland. \n \n \n \n Seleucus also, in his treatise on Dialects, says, that there is a kind of garland\n made of myrtle, which is called \u02bc\u1f10\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2, being\n twenty cubits in circumference, and that it is carried in procession on the\n festival of the Ellotia. And he says, that in this garland the bones of Europa,\n whom they call Ellotis, are carried. And this festival of the Ellotia is\n celebrated in Corinth. \n There is also the \u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. This also is a name\n given to a species of garland by the Laced\u00e6monians, as Sosibius tells us in his\n treatise on Sacrifices, where he says, that now it is called \u03c8\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, being made of branches of the palm-tree. And he says that\n they are worn, as a memorial of the victory which they gained, in Thyrea, by the leaders of the choruses, which are\n employed in that festival when they celebrate the Gymnopeedi\u00e6. And there are choruses, some of handsome boys, and others of full-grown\n men of distinguished bravery, who all dance naked, and who sing the songs of\n Thaletas and Alcman, and the paeans of Dionysodotus the Laced\u00e6monian. \n There are also garlands called \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, , which\n are mentioned by Alexis in his Crateva, or the Apothecary, in the following line\u2014\n \n And many \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 garlands hanging. \n \n \n There is the word too, \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, , which Seleucus\n explains by every sort of garland. But Timachidas says,\n Garlands of every kind which are worn by women are called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. \n \n \n There are also the words \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u1f76\u03c2 and \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2, which are names given to garlands by the\n Aeolians and Ionians, and they wear such around their necks, as one may clearly\n collect from the poetry of Alc\u00e6us and Anacreon. But Philetas, in his Miscellanies,\n says, that the Lesbians call a branch of myrtle \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u1f76\u03c2, around which they twine violets and other flowers. \n The \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 also is a species of garland. But\n Theodorus, in his Attic Words, says, that it is a particular kind of garland, and\n is used in that sense by Plato the comic poet, in his Jupiter Ill-treated. \n ","22":"\n I find also, in the comic poets, mention made of a kind of garland called \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2, , and I find that Archippus mentions it in his\n Rhinon, in these lines\u2014 \n He went away unhurt to his own house, \n Having laid aside his cloak, but having on \n His \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 garland. \n And Alexis, in his Agonis, or The Colt, says\u2014 \n This third man has a \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 garland \n Of fig-leaves; but while living he delighted \n In similar ornaments: \n and in his Sciron he says\u2014 \n Like a \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 garland in suspense. \n \n Antiphanes also mentions it in his Man in Love with Himself.\n And Eubulus, in his \u0152nomaus, or Pelops, saying\u2014 \n Brought into circular shape, \n Like a \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 garland. \n \n \n What, then, is this \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ? For I am aware that\n Nicander of Thyatira, in his Attic Nouns, speaks as follows,\u2014 ' \u02bc\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, and especially those made of\n roses. And now I ask what species of garland this was, O Cynulcus; and\n do not tell me that I am to understand the word as meaning merely large. For you\n are a man who are fond of not only picking things little known out of books, but\n of even digging out such matters; like the philosophers in the Joint Deceiver of\n Baton the comic poet; men whom Sophocles also mentions in his Fellow Feasters, and\n who resemble you,\u2014 \n You should not wear a beard thus well perfumed, \n And 'tis a shame for you, of such high birth, \n To be reproached as the son of your belly, \n When you might rather be call'd your father's son. \n Since, then, you are sated not only with the heads of glaucus, but also\n with that ever-green herb, which that Anthedonian Deity ate, and became immortal, give us an answer now\n about the subject of discussion, that we may not think that when you are dead, you\n will be metamorphosed, as the divine Plato has described in his treatise on the\n Soul. For he says that those who are addicted to gluttony, and insolence, and\n drunkenness, and who are restrained by no modesty, may naturally become\n transformed into the race of asses, and similar animals. \n ","23":"\n And as he still appeared to be in doubt;\u2014Let us now, said Ulpian, go on to another\n kind of garland, which is called the \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \n which Asclepiades mentions when he quotes the following passage, out of the Female\n Garland Sellers of Eubulus\u2014 \n O happy woman, in your little house \n To have a \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 . . . . . \n \n And this garland is made of the flower called \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (soapwort), which is mentioned by Theophrastus, in the\n sixth book of his Natural History, in these words\u2014 The\n iris also blooms in the summer, and so does the flower called \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, which is a very pretty flower to the eye,\n but destitute of scent. Galene of Smyrna also speaks of the same\n flower, under the name of \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \n \n There is also the \u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. . There is a certain kind\n of garland with this name, as Nicander the Colophonian tells us in his treatise on\n Words. And this, too, perhaps is so named as being made of the flower called\n \u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, , which the same Theophrastus mentions in\n the sixth book of his Natural History, where he writes thus\u2014\"There are other\n flowers which bloom chiefly in the summer,\u2014the lychnis, the flower of Jove, the\n lily, the iphyum, the Phrygian amaracus, and also the plant called pothus, of\n which there are two kinds, one bearing a flower like the hyacinth, but the other\n produces a colour-less blossom nearly white, which men use to strew on tombs. \n Eubulus also gives a list of other names of garlands\u2014 \n Aegidion, carry now this garland for me, \n Ingeniously wrought of divers flowers, \n Most tempting, and most beautiful, by Jove! \n For who'd not wish to kiss the maid who bears it? \n And then in the subsequent lines he says\u2014 \n \n A. Perhaps you want some garlands. Will you have\n them \n Of ground thyme, or of myrtle, or of flowers \n Such as I show you here in bloom. \n \n B. I'll have \n These myrtle ones. You may sell all the others, \n But always keep the myrtle wreaths for me. \n \n \n ","24":"\n There is the philyrinus also. Xenarchus, in his Soldier, says\u2014 \n For the boy wore a garland on his brow \n Of delicate leafy linden ( \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 ). \n Some garlands also are called \u1f11\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76, as\n they are even to this day among the Alexandrians. And Ch\u00e6remon the tragic poet\n mentions them in his Bacchus, saying\u2014 \n The triple folds of the \u1f11\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76 \n garlands, \n Made up of ivy and narcissus. \n But concerning the evergreen garlands in Egypt, Helanicus, in his History\n of Egypt, writes as follows\u2014 There is a city on the banks of the river,\n named Tindium. This is place where many gods are assembled, and in the middle\n of the city there is a sacred temple of great size made of marble, and the\n doors are marble. And within the temple there are white\n and black thorns, on which garlands were placed made of the flower of the\n acanthus, and also of the blossoms of the pomegranate, and of vine leaves. And\n these keep green for ever. These garlands were placed by the gods themselves in\n Egypt when they heard that Babys was king, (and he is the same who is also\n called Typhon.) But Demetrius, in his History of the Things to be seen\n in Egypt, says that these thorns grow about the city of Abydos, and he writes\n thus\u2014 But the lower district has a tree called the thorn, which bears a\n round fruit on some round-shaped branches. And this tree blooms at a certain\n season; and the flower is very beautiful and brilliant in colour. And there is\n a story told by the Egyptians, that the Aethiopians who had been sent as allies\n to Troy by Tithonus, when they heard that Memnon was slain, threw down on the\n spot all their garlands on the thorns. And the branches themselves on which the\n flower grows resemble garlands. And the before-mentioned Hellanicus\n mentions also that Amasis, who was king of Egypt, was originally a private\n individual of the class of the common people; and that it was owing to the present\n of a garland, which he made of the most beautiful flowers that were in season, and\n sent to Patarmis, who was king of Egypt, at the time when he was celebrating the\n festival of his birthday, that he afterwards became king himself. For Patarmis,\n being delighted at the beauty of the garland, invited Amasis to supper, and after\n this treated him as one of his friends; and on one occasion sent him out as his\n general, when the Egyptians were making war upon him. And he was made king by\n these Egyptians out of their hatred to Patarmis. \n ","25":"\n There are also garlands called \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9, ,\n which people make and furnish by contract. Aristophanes, in his Thesmophoriazus\u00e6,\n says\u2014 \n \n \n To make up twenty \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 \n garlands. \n \n Ar. Thesm. 458. \n \n We find also the word \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd. Apion, in\n his treatise on the Roman Dialect, says that formerly a garland was called\n \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd, from the fact of the members of the\n chorus in the theatres using it; and that they wore garlands and contended for\n garlands. And one may see this name given to garlands in the Epigrams of\n Simonides\u2014 \n \n Ph\u0153bus doth teach that song to the Tyndarid\u00e6, \n Which tuneless grasshoppers have crown'd with a \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2. \n \n \n \n There are \u1f00\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 too. There are some garlands\n made of the basil thyme ( \u1f04\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) which are called\n by this name, as we are told by Andron the physician, whose words are quoted by\n Parthenius the pupil of Dionysius, in the first book of his treatise on the Words\n which occur in the Historians. \n ","26":"\n Now Theophrastus gives the following list of flowers as suitable to be made into\n garlands\u2014- The violet, the flower of Jupiter, the iphyum, the wallflower,\n the hemerocalles, or yellow lily. But he says the earliest blooming flower is\n the white violet; and about the same time that which is called the wild\n wallflower appears, and after them the narcissus and the lily; and of mountain\n flowers, that kind of anemone which is called the mountain anemone, and the\n head of the bulb-plant. For some people twine these flowers into garlands. And\n next to these there comes the \u0153nanthe and the purple violet. And of wild\n flowers, there are the helichryse, and that species of anemone called the\n meadow anemone, and the gladiolus, and the hyacinth. But the rose is the latest\n blooming flower of all; and it is the latest to appeal and the first to go off.\n But the chief summer flowers are the lychnis, and the flower of Jupiter, and\n the lily, and the iphyum, and the Phrygian amaracus, and also the flower called\n the pothus. And in his ninth book the same Theophrastus says, if any\n one wears a garland made of the flower of the helichryse, he is praised if he\n sprinkle it with ointment. And, Alcman mentions it in these lines\u2014 \n And I pray to you, and bring \n This chaplet of the helichryse, \n And of the holy cypirus. \n And Ibycus says\u2014 \n Myrtle-berries with violets mix'd, \n And helichryse, and apple blossoms, \n And roses, and the tender daphne. \n And Cratinus, in his Effeminate People, says\u2014 \n With ground thyme and with crocuses, \n And hyacinths, and helichryse. \n But the helichryse is a flower like the lotus. And Themistagoras the\n Ephesian, in his book entitled The Golden Book, says that the flower derives its\n name from the nymph who first picked it, who was called\n Helichrysa. There are also, says Theophrastus, such flowers as purple lilies. But\n Philinus says that the lily, which he calls \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, is by some people called \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, , and by others \u1f34\u03bf\u03bd. The\n Corinthians also call this flower ambrosia, as Nicander says in his Dictionary.\n And Diocles, in his treatise on Deadly Poisons, says\u2014 The amaracus, which\n some people call the sampsychus. \n \n ","27":"\n Cratinus also speaks of the hyacinth by the name of \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd in his Effeminate People, where he says\u2014 \n I crown my head with flowers, \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, \n \n Roses, and \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b1, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1. \n \n And Clearchus, in the second book of his Lives, says\u2014\"You may remark the\n Laced\u00e6monians who, having invented garlands of cosmosandalum, trampled under foot\n the most ancient system of polity in the world, and utterly ruined themselves; on\n which account Antiphanes the comic poet very cleverly says of them, in his\n Harp-player\u2014 \n Did not the Laced\u00e6monians boast of old \n As though they were invincible? but now \n They wear effeminate purple head-dresses. \n And Hicesius, in the second book of his treatise on Matter,\n says\u2014 The white violet is of moderately astringent properties, and has a\n most delicious fragrance, and is very delightful, but only for a short time;\n and the purple violet is of the same appearance, but it is far more\n fragrant. And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Beasts, says\u2014 There\n is the cham\u00e6pitys, or ground pine, which some call olocyrum, but the Athenians\n call it Ionia, and the Eub\u0153ans sideritis. And Nicander, in the second\n book of his Georgics, (the words themselves I will quote hereafter, when I\n thoroughly discuss all the flowers fit for making into garlands,) says\u2014 The\n violet ( \u1f34\u03bf\u03bd ) was originally given by some\n Ionian nymphs to Ion. \n \n And in the sixth book of his History of Plants, Theophrastus says that the\n narcissus is also called \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; but in a\n subsequent passage he speaks of the narcissus and \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd as different plants. And Eumachus the Corcyrean, in his\n treatise on Cutting Roots, says that the narcissus is also called acacallis, and\n likewise crotalum. But the flower called hemerocalles, or day-beauty, which fades\n at night but blooms at sunrise, is mentioned by Cratinus in\n his Effeminate People, where he says\u2014 \n And the dear hemerocalles. \n Concerning the ground thyme, Theophrastus says\u2014 The people gather\n the wild ground thyme on the mountains and plant it around Sicyon, and the\n Athenians gather it on Hymettus; and other nations too have mountains fill of\n this flower, as the Thracians for instance. But Philinus says that it\n is called zygis. And Amerias the Macedonian, speaking of the lychnis in his\n treatise on Cutting up Roots, says that it sprang from the baths of Venus,\n when Venus bathed after having been sleeping with Vulcan. And it is found in\n the greatest perfection in Cyprus and Lemnos, and also in Stromboli and near\n mount Eryx, and at Cythera. \n \n \n But the iris, says Theophrastus, blooms in the summer, and\n is the only one of all the European flowers which has a sweet scent. And it is\n in the highest beauty in those parts of Illyricum which are at a distance from\n the sea. But Philinus says that the flowers of the iris are called\n \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9, because they resemble the lips of the\n wolf ( \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ). And Nicolaus of Damascus, in the\n hundred and eighth book of his History, says that there is a lake near the Alps,\n many stadia in circumference, round which there grow every year the most fragrant\n and beautiful flowers, like those which are called calch\u00e6. Alcman also mentions\n the calch\u00e6 in these lines:\u2014 \n Having a golden-colour'd necklace on \n Of the bright calch\u00e6, with their tender petals. \n And Epicharmus, too, speaks of them in his Rustic. \n ","28":"\n Of roses, says Theophrastus in his sixth book, there are many varieties. For most\n of them consist only of five leaves, but some have twelve leaves; and some, near\n Philippi, have even as many as a hundred leaves. For men take up the plants from\n Mount Pang\u00e6um, (and they are very numerous there,) and plant them near the city.\n And the inner petals are very small; for the fashion in which the flowers put out\n their petals is, that some form the outer rows and some the inner ones: but they\n have not much smell, nor are they of any great size. And those with only five\n leaves are the most fragrant, and their lower parts are very thorny. But the most\n fragrant roses are in Cyrene: on which account the perfumes\n made there are the sweetest. And in this country, too, the perfume of the violets,\n and of all other flowers, is most pure and heavenly; and above all, the fragrance\n of the crocus is most delicious in those parts.\" And Timachidas, in his Banquets,\n says that the Arcadians call the rose \u03b5\u1f50\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \n meaning \u03b5\u1f54\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, or fragrant. And Apollodorus, in\n the fourth book of his History of Parthia, speaks of a flower called philadelphum,\n as growing in the country of the Parthians, and describes it thus:\u2014 And\n there are many kinds of myrtle, \u2014the milax, and that which is called the\n philadelphum, which has received a name corresponding to its natural character;\n for when branches, which are at a distance from one another, meet together of\n their own accord, they cohere with a vigorous embrace, and become united as if\n they came from one root, and then growing on, they produce fresh shoots: on\n which account they often make hedges of them in well-cultivated farms; for they\n take the thinnest of the shoots, and plait them in a net-like manner, and plant\n them all round their gardens, and then these plants, when plaited together all\n round, make a fence which it is difficult to pass through. \n \n ","29":"\n The author, too, of the Cyprian Poems gives lists of the flowers which are\n suitable to be made into garlands, whether he was Hegesias, or Stasinus, or any\n one else; for Demodamas, who was either a Halicarnassian or Milesian, in his\n History of Halicarnassus, says that the Cyprian Poems were the work of a citizen\n of Halicarnassus: however, the author, whoever he was, in his eleventh book,\n speaks thus:\u2014 \n Then did the Graces, and the smiling Hours, \n Make themselves garments rich with various hues, \n And dyed them in the varied flowers that Spring \n And the sweet Seasons in their bosom bear. \n In crocus, hyacinth, and blooming violet, \n And the sweet petals of the peerless rose, \n So fragrant, so divine; nor did they scorn \n The dewy cups of the ambrosial flower \n That boasts Narcissus' name. Such robes, perfumed \n With the rich treasures of revolving seasons, \n The golden Venus wears. \n And this poet appears also to have been acquainted with the use of\n garlands, when he says\u2014 \n And when the smiling Venus with her train \n Had woven fragrant garlands of the treasures \n The flowery earth puts forth, the goddesses \n \n All crown'd their heads with their queen's precious work,\u2014 \n The Nymphs and Graces, and the golden Venus,\u2014 \n And raised a tuneful song round Ida's springs. \n \n \n ","30":"\n Nicander also, in the second book of his Georgics, gives a regular list of the\n flowers suitable to be made into garlands, and speaks as follows concerning the\n Ionian nymphs and concerning roses:\u2014 \n And many other flowers you may plant, \n Fragrant and beauteous, of Ionian growth; \n Two sorts of violets are there,\u2014pallid one, \n And like the colour of the virgin gold, \n Such as th' Ionian nymphs to Ion gave, \n When in the meadows of the holy Pisa \n They met and loved and crown'd the modest youth. \n For he had cheer'd his hounds and slain the boar, \n And in the clear Alpheus bathed his limbs, \n Before he visited those friendly nymphs. \n Cut then the shoots from off the thorny rose, \n And plant them in the trenches, leaving space \n Between, two spans in width. The poets tell \n That Midas first, when Asia's realms he left, \n Brought roses from th' Odonian hills of Thrace, \n And cultivated them in th' Emathian lands, \n Blooming and fragrant with their sixty petals. \n Next to th' Emathian roses those are praised \n Which the Megarian Nis\u00e6a displays: \n Nor is Phaselis, nor the land which worships \n The chaste Diana, to be lightly praised, \n Made verdant by the sweet Leth\u00e6an stream. \n In other trenches place the ivy cuttings, \n And often e'en a branch with berries loaded \n May be entrusted to the grateful ground; \n * * * * * \n \n Or with well-sharpen'd knife cut off the shoots, \n And plait them into baskets, \n * * * * * \n High on the top the calyx full of seed \n Grows with white leaves, tinged in the heart with gold, \n Which some call crina, others liria, \n Others ambrosia, but those who love \n The fittest name, do call them Venus' joy; \n \n For in their colour they do vie with Venus, \n Though far inferior to her decent form. \n The iris in its roots is like th' agallis, \n Or hyacinth fresh sprung from Ajax' blood; \n It rises high with swallow-shaped flowers, \n Blooming when summer brings the swallows back. \n Thick are the leaves they from their bosom pour, \n And the fresh flowers constantly succeeding, \n Shine in their stooping mouths. \n * * * * * \n Nor is the lychnis, nor the lofty rush, \n Nor the fair anthemis in light esteem, \n Nor the boanthemum with towering stem, \n Nor phlox whose brilliancy scarce seems to yield \n To the bright splendour of the midday sun. \n Plant the ground thyme where the more fertile ground \n Is moisten'd by fresh-welling springs beneath, \n That with long creeping branches it may spread, \n Or droop in quest of some transparent spring, \n The wood-nymphs' chosen draught. Throw far away \n The poppy's leaves, and keep the head entire, \n A sure protection from the teasing gnats; \n For every kind of insect makes its seat \n Upon the opening leaves; and on the head, \n Like freshening dews, they feed, and much rejoice \n In the rich latent honey that it bears; \n But when the leaves ( \u03b8\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b1 ) are off, the\n mighty flame \n Soon scatters them . . . . \n (but by the word \u03b8\u03c1\u1fd6\u03b1 he does not here\n mean the leaves of fig-trees, but of the poppy). \n Nor can they place their feet \n With steady hold, nor juicy food extract; \n And oft they slip, and fall upon their heads. \n Swift is the growth, and early the perfection \n Of the sampsychum, and of rosemary, \n And of the others which the gardens \n Supply to diligent men for well-earn'd garlands. \n Such are the feathery fern, the boy's-love sweet, \n (Like the tall poplar); such the golden crocus, \n Fair flower of early spring; the gopher white, \n And fragrant thyme, and all the unsown beauty \n Which in moist grounds the verdant meadows bear; \n The ox-eye, the sweet-smelling flower of Jove, \n The chalca, and the much sung hyacinth, \n And the low-growing violet, to which \n Dark Proserpine a darker hue has given; \n The tall panosmium, and the varied colours \n Which the gladiolus puts forth in vain \n To decorate the early tombs of maidens. \n Then too the ever-flourishing anemones, \n Tempting afar with their most vivid dyes. \n \n (But for \u1f10\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\n \u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u1fc7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd some copies have \u1f10\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\n \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 ). \n And above all remember to select \n The elecampane and the aster bright, \n And place them in the temples of the gods, \n By roadside built, or hang them on their statues, \n Which first do catch the eye of the visitor. \n These are propitious gifts, whether you pluck \n The many-hued chrysanthemum, or lilies \n Which wither sadly o'er the much-wept tomb, \n Or gay old-man, or long-stalk'd cyclamen, \n Or rank nasturtium, whose scarlet flowers \n Grim Pluto chooses for his royal garland. \n \n \n ","31":"\n From these lines it is plain that the chelidonium is a different flower from the\n anemone (for some people have called them the same). But Theophrastus says that\n there are some plants, the flowers of which constantly follow the stars, such as\n the one called the heliotrope, and the chelidonium; and this last plant is named\n so from its coming into bloom at the same time as the swallows arrive. There is\n also a flower spoken of under the name of ambrosia by Carystius, in his Historical\n Commentaries, where he says\u2014 Nicander says that the plant named ambrosia\n grows at Cos, on the head of the statue of Alexander. But I have\n already spoken of it, and mentioned that some people give this name to the lily.\n And Timachidas, in the fourth book of his banquet, speaks also of a flower called\n theseum,\u2014 \n The soft theseum, like the apple blossom, \n The sacred blossom of Leucerea, \n \n Which the fair goddess loves above all others. \n And he says that the garland of Ariadne was made of this flower. \n Pherecrates also, or whoever the poet was who wrote the play of the Persians,\n mentions some flowers as fit for garlands, and says\u2014 \n O you who sigh like mallows soft, \n Whose breath like hyacinths smells, \n Who like the melilotus speak, \n And smile as doth the rose, \n Whose kisses are as marjoram sweet, \n Whose action crisp as parsley, \n \n Whose gait like cosmosandalum. \n Pour rosy wine, and with loud voice \n Raise the glad p\u00e6an's song, \n As laws of God and man enjoin \n On holy festival. \n And the author of the Miners, whoever he was, (and that poem is\n attributed to the same Pherecrates,) says\u2014 \n Treading on soft aspalathi \n Beneath the shady trees, \n In lotus-bearing meadows green, \n And on the dewy cypirus; \n And on the fresh anthryscum, and \n The modest tender violet, \n And green trefoil. . . \n \n \n But here I want to know what this trefoil is; for there is a poem attributed to\n Demarete, which is called The Trefoil. And also, in the poem which is entitled The\n Good Men, Pherecrates or Strattis, whichever is the author, says\u2014 \n And having bathed before the heat of day, \n Some crown their head and some anoint their bodies. \n And he speaks of thyme, and of cosmosandalum. And Cratinus, in his\n Effeminate Persons, says\u2014 \n Joyful now I crown my head \n With every kind of flower; \n \n \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, roses, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 too, \n And cosmosandala, \n And violets, and fragrant thyme, \n And spring anemones, \n Ground thyme, crocus, hyacinths, \n And buds of helichryse, \n Shoots of the vine, anthryscum too, \n And lovely hemerocalles. \n * * * * * * \n My head is likewise shaded \n With evergreen melilotus; \n And of its own accord there comes \n The flowery cytisus. \n \n \n ","32":"\n Formerly the entrance of garlands and perfumes into the banqueting rooms, used to\n herald the approach of the second course, as we may learn from Nicostratus in his\n Pseudostigmatias, where, in the following lines, he says\u2014 \n And you too, \n Be sure and have the second course quite neat; \n Adorn it with all kinds of rich confections, \n Perfumes, and garlands, aye, and frankincense, \n And girls to play the flute. \n \n \n \n But Philoxenus the Dithyrambic poet, in his poem entitled The Banquet, represents\n the garland as entering into the commencement of the banquet, using the following\n language: \n Then water was brought in to wash the hands, \n Which a delicate youth bore in a silver ewe, \n Ministering to the guests; and after that \n He brought us garlands of the tender myrtle, \n Close woven with young richly-colour'd shoots. \n And Eubulus, in his Nurses, says\u2014 \n For when the old men came into the house, \n At once they sate them down. Immediately \n Garlands were handed round; a well-fill'd board \n Was placed before them, and (how good for th' eyes!) \n A closely-kneaded loaf of barley bread. \n And this was the fashion also among the Egyptians, as Nicostratus says in\n his Usurer; for, representing the usurer as an Egyptian, he says\u2014 \n \n A. We caught the pimp and two of his companions, \n When they had just had water for their hands, \n And garlands. \n \n B. Sure the time, O Ch\u00e6rophon, \n Was most propitious. \n But you may go on gorging yourself, O Cynulcus; and when you have done,\n tell us why Cratinus has called the melilotus the ever-watching\n melilotus. However, as I see you are already a little tipsy ( \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd )\u2014for that is the word Alexis has used for a man\n thoroughly drunk ( \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03cd\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd ), in his Settler\u2014 I\n won't go on teasing you; but I will bid the slaves, as Sophocles says in his\n Fellow Feasters, \n Come, quick! let some one make the barley-cakes, \n And fill the goblets deep; for this man now, \n Just like a farmer's ox, can't work a bit \n Till he has fill'd his belly with good food. \n And there is a man of the same kind mentioned by Aristias of Phlius; for\n he, too, in his play entitled The Fates, says\u2014 \n The guest is either a boatman or a parasite, \n A hanger-on of hell, with hungry belly, \n Which nought can satisfy. \n However, as he gives no answer whatever to all these things which have\n been said, I order him (as it is said in the Twins of Alexis) to be carried out of\n the party, crowned with \u03c7\u03cd\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 garlands. But the\n comic poet, alluding to \u03c7\u03cd\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 garlands, says\u2014\n \n These garlands all promiscuously ( \u03c7\u03cd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd )\n woven. \n \n But, after this, I will not carry on this conversation any\n fur- there to-day; but will leave the discussion about perfumes to those who\n choose to continue it: and only desire the boy, on account of this lecture of mine\n about garlands, as Antiphanes. . . . . \n To bring now hither two good garlands, \n And a good lamp, with good fire brightly burning; \n for then I shall wind up my speech like the conclusion of a play. \n And not many days after this, as if he had been prophesying a silence for himself\n [which should be eternal], he died, happily, without suffering under any long\n illness, to the great affliction of us his companions. \n ","33":"\n And while the slaves were bringing round perfumes in alabaster boxes, and in other\n vessels made of gold, some one, seeing Cynulcus, anointed his face with a great\n deal of ointment. But he, being awakened by it, when he recollected himself,\n said;\u2014What is this? O Hercules, will not some one come with a sponge and wipe my\n face, which is thus polluted with a lot of dirt? And do not you all know that that\n exquisite writer Xenophon, in his Banquet, represents Socrates as speaking\n thus:\u2014 ' By Jupiter! O Callias, you entertain us superbly; for you have\n not only given us a most faultless feast, but you have furnished us also with\n delicious food for our eyes and ears.'\u2014' Well, then,' said he, 'suppose any one\n were to bring us perfumes, in order that we might also banquet on sweet smells?\n '\u2014' By no means,' said Socrates; ' for as there is one sort of dress fit for\n women and another for men, so there is one kind of smell fit for women and\n another for men. And no man is ever anointed with perfume for the sake of men;\n and as to women, especially when they are brides,\u2014as, for instance, the bride\n of this Niceratus here, and the bride of Critobulus,\u2014how can they want perfumes\n in their husbands, when they themselves are redolent of it But the smell of the\n oil in the gymnasia, when it is present, is sweeter than perfume to women; and\n when it is absent, they long more for it. For if a slave and a freeman be\n anointed with perfume, they both smell alike in a moment; but those smells\n which are derived from free labours, require both virtuous habits and a good\n deal of time if they are to be agreeable and in character with a\n freeman.' And that admirable writer Chrysippus\n says that perfumes ( \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 ) derive their name from\n being prepared with great toil ( \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ) and useless\n labour. The Laced\u00e6monians even expel from Sparta those who make perfumes, as being\n wasters of oil; and those who dye wool, as being destroyers of the whiteness of\n the wool. And Solon the philosopher, in his laws, forbade men to be sellers of\n perfumes. \n ","34":"\n \n But now, not only scents, as Clearchus says in the third book of\n his Lives, but also dyes, being full of luxury, tend to make those men\n effeminate who have anything to do with them. And do you think that effeminacy\n without virtue has anything desirable in it? But even Sappho, a thorough woman,\n and a poetess into the bargain, was ashamed to separate honour from elegance;\n and speaks thus\u2014 \n But elegance I truly love; \n And this my love of life has brilliancy, \n And honour, too, attached to it: \n making it evident to everybody that the desire of life that she\n confessed had respectability and honour in it; and these things especially\n belong to virtue. But Parrhasius the painter, although he was a man beyond all\n measure arrogant about his art, and though he got the credit of a liberal\n profession by some mere pencils and pallets, still in words set up a claim to\n virtue, and put this inscription on all his works that are at Lindus:\u2014 \n This is Parrhasius' the painter's work, \n A most luxurious ( \u1f01\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ) and\n virtuous man. \n And a wit being indignant at this, because, I suppose, he seemed to be\n a disgrace to the delicacy and beauty of virtue, having perverted the gifts\n which fortune had bestowed upon him to luxury, proposed to change the\n inscription into \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1 : Still, said\n he, the man must be endured, since he says that he honours virtue. \n These are the words of Clearchus. But Sophocles the poet, in his play called The\n Judgment, represents Venus, being a sort of Goddess of Pleasure, as anointed with\n perfumes, and looking in a glass; but Minerva, as being a sort of Goddess of\n Intellect and Mind, and also of Virtue, as using oil and gymnastic exercises. \n ","35":"\n In reply to this, Masurius said;\u2014But, my most excellent friend, are you not aware\n that it is in our brain that our senses are soothed, and indeed reinvigorated, by\n sweet smells? as Alexis says in his Wicked Woman, where he\n speaks thus\u2014 \n The best recipe for health \n Is to apply sweet scents unto the brain. \n And that most valiant, and indeed warlike poet, Alc\u00e6us, says\u2014 \n He shed a sweet perfume all o'er my breast. \n And the wise Anacreon says somewhere\u2014 \n Why fly away, now that you've well anointed \n Your breast, more hollow than a flute, with unguents? \n for he recommends anointing the breast with unguent, as being the seat of\n the heart, and considering it an admitted point that that is soothed with fragrant\n smells. And the ancients used to act thus, not only because scents do of their own\n nature ascend upwards from the breast to the seat of smelling, but also because\n they thought that the soul had its abode in the heart; as Praxagoras, and\n Philotimus the physician taught; and Homer, too, says\u2014 \n \n \n He struck his breast, and thus reproved his heart. \n \n Hom. Odyss. xx. 17. \n \n And again he says\u2014 \n \n \n His heart within his breast did rage. \n \n Ibid. 13. \n \n And in the Iliad he says\u2014 \n \n \n But Hector's heart within his bosom shook. \n \n Hom. Iliad, vii. 216. \n \n And this they consider a proof that the most important portion of the\n soul is situated in the heart; for it is as evident as possible that the heart\n quivers when under the agitation of fear. And Agamemnon, in Homer, says\u2014 \n \n \n Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain, \n And scarce my heart support its load of pain; \n With fears distracted, with no fix'd design, \n And all my people's miseries are mine. \n \n Iliad, x. 96. \n \n And Sophocles has represented women released from fear as saying\u2014 \n \n \n Now Fear's dark daughter does no more exult \n Within my heart. \n \n This is not from any extant play. \n \n But Anaxandrides makes a man who is struggling with fear say\u2014 \n O my wretched heart! \n How you alone of all my limbs or senses \n Rejoice in evil; for you leap and dance \n The moment that you see your lord alarm'd. \n \n And Plato says, that the great Architect of the\n universe has placed the lungs close to the heart, by nature soft and destitute\n of blood, and having cavities penetrable like sponge, that so the heart, when\n it quivers, from fear of adversity or disaster, may vibrate against a soft and\n yielding substance. But the garlands with which men bind their bosoms\n are called \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 by the poets, from the\n exhalations ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 of the flowers, and not\n because the soul ( \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74 ) is called \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u1f78\u03c2, as some people think. \n ","36":"\n Archilochus is the earliest author who uses the word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (perfume), where he says\u2014 \n She being old would spare her perfumes ( \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 ). \n And in another place he says\u2014 \n Displaying hair and breast perfumed ( \u1f10\u03c3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ); \n So that a man, though old, might fall in love with her. \n And the word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd is derived from\n \u03bc\u03cd\u1fe4\u1fe5\u03b1, which is the Aeolic form of \u03c3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1 (myrrh); for the greater portion of unguents are\n made up with myrrh, and that which is called \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1f74 is wholly composed of it. Not but what Homer was acquainted\n with the fashion of using unguents and perfumes, but he calls them \u1f14\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1, with the addition of some distinctive epithet,\n as- \n \n \n Himself anointing them with dewy oil ( \u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\n \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u1ff3 ). \n \n Hom. Iliad, xxiii. 186. \n \n And in another place he speaks of an oil as perfumed ( \u03c4\u03b5\u03b8\u03c5\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. And in his poems also, Venus anoints the\n dead body of Hector with ambrosial rosy oil; and this is made of flowers. But with\n respect to that which is made of spices, which they called \u03b8\u03c5\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, he says, speaking of Juno,\u2014 \n \n \n Here first she bathes, and round her body pours \n Soft oils of fragrance and ambrosial showers: \n The winds perfumed, the balmy gale convey \n Through heaven, through earth, and all the a\u00ebrial way. \n Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets \n The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets. \n \n Ibid. xiv. 170. \n \n \n \n ","37":"\n But the choicest unguents are made in particular places, as Apollonius of\n Herophila says in his treatise on Perfumes, where he writes\u2014\u201cThe iris is best in\n Elis, and at Cyzicus; the perfume made from roses is most excellent at Phaselis,\n and that made at Naples and Capua is also very fine. That made from crocuses is in\n the highest perfection at Soli in Cilicia, and at Rhodes.\n The essence of spikenard is best at Tarsus; and the extract of vine-leaves is made\n best in Cyprus and at Adramyttium. The best perfume from marjoram and from apples\n comes from Cos. Egypt bears the palm for its essence of cypirus; and the next best\n is the Cyprian, and Ph\u0153nician, and after them comes the Sidonian. The perfume\n called Panathenaicum is made at Athens; and those called Metopian and Mendesian\n are prepared with the greatest skill in Egypt. But the Metopian is made of oil\n which is extracted from bitter almonds. Still, the superior excellence of each\n perfume is owing to the purveyors and the materials and the artists, and not to\n the place itself; for Ephesus formerly, as men say, had a high reputation for the\n excellence of its perfumes, and especially of its megallium, but now it has none.\n At one time, too, the unguents made in Alexandria were brought to high perfection,\n on account of the wealth of the city, and the attention that Arsinoe and Berenice\n paid to such matters; and the finest extract of roses in the world was made at\n Cyrene while the great Berenice was alive. Again, in ancient times, the extract of\n vine-leaves made at Adramyttium was but poor; but afterwards it became first-rate,\n owing to Stratonice, the wife of Eumenes. Formerly, too, Syria used to make every\n sort of unguent admirably, especially that extracted from fenugreek; but the case\n is quite altered now. And long ago there used to be a most delicious unguent\n extracted from frankincense at Pergamus, owing to the invention of a certain\n perfumer of that city, for no one else had ever made it before him; but now none\n is made there. \n \n Now, when a valuable unguent is poured on the top of one that is inferior,\n it remains on the surface; but when good honey is poured on the top of that\n which is inferior, it works its way to the bottom, for it compels that which is\n worse to rise above it. \n \n ","38":"\n Ach\u00e6us mentions Egyptian perfumes in his Prizes; and says\u2014 \n They'll give you Cyprian stones, and ointments choice \n From dainty Egypt, worth their weight in silver. \n \n And perhaps, says Didymus, he means in this passage that\n which is called \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1f74, on account of the myrrh\n which is brought to Egypt, and from thence imported into Greece. \n And Hicesius says, in the second book of his treatise on\n Matter,\u2014 Of perfumes, some are rubbed on, and some are poured on. Now,\n the perfume made from roses is suitable for drinking parties, and so is that\n made from myrtles and from apples; and this last is good for the stomach, and\n useful for lethargic people. That made from vine-leaves is good for the\n stomach, and has also the effect of keeping the mind clear. Those extracted\n from sampsychum and ground thyme are also well suited to drinking parties; and\n so is that extract of crocus which is not mixed with any great quantity of\n myrrh. The \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1f74, , also, is well suited for\n drinking parties; and so is the spikenard: that made from fenugreek is sweet\n and tender; while that which comes from white violets is fragrant, and very\n good for the digestion. \n \n Theophrastus, also, in his treatise on Scents, says, that some perfumes are\n made of flowers; as, for instance, from roses, and white violets, and lilies,\n which last is called \u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. There are also\n those which are extracted from mint and ground thyme, and gopper, and the\n crocus; of which the best is procured in Aegina and Cilicia. Some, again, are\n made of leaves, as those made from myrrh and the \u0153nanthe; and the wild vine\n grows in Cyprus, on the mountains, and is very plentiful; but no perfume is\n made of that which is found in Greece, because that has no scent. Some\n perfumes, again, are extracted from roots; as is that made from the iris, and\n from spikenard, and from marjoram, and from zedoary. \n \n ","39":"\n Now, that the ancients were very much addicted to the use of perfumes, is plain\n from their knowing to which of our limbs each unguent was most suitable.\n Accordingly, Antiphanes, in his Thoricians, or The Digger, says\u2014 \n \n A. He really bathes\u2014 \n \n B. What then? \n \n A. In a large gilded tub, and steeps his feet \n And legs in rich Egyptian unguents; \n His jaws and breasts he rubs with thick palm-oil, \n And both his arms with extract sweet of mint; \n His eyebrows and his hair with marjoram, \n His knees and neck with essence of ground thyme. \n And Cephisodorus, in his Trophonius, says\u2014 \n \n A. And now that I may well anoint my body, \n Buy me some unguents, I beseech you, Xanthias, \n Of roses made and irises. Buy, too, \n \n Some oil of baccaris for my legs and feet. \n \n B. You stupid wretch! Shall I buy baccaris, \n And waste it on your worthless feet? \n Anaxandrides, too, in his Protesilaus, says\u2014 \n Unguents from Peron, which but yesterday \n He sold to Melanopus,\u2014very costly, \n Fresh come from Egypt; which he uses now \n To anoint the feet of vile Callistratus. \n And Theopompus also mentions this perfumer, Peron, in his Admetus, and in\n the Hedychares. Antiphanes, too, says in his Antea\u2014 \n I left the man in Peron's shop, just now, \n Dealing for ointments; when he has agreed, \n He'll bring you cinnamon and spikenard essence. \n \n \n ","40":"\n Now, there is a sort of ointment called \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \n by many of the comic poets; and Hipponax uses this name in the following line:\u2014\n \n I then my nose with baccaris anointed, \n Redolent of crocus. \n And Acheus, in his Aethon, a satyric drama, says\u2014 \n Anointed o'er with baccaris, and dressing \n All his front hair with cooling fans of feathers. \n But Ion, in his Omphale, says\u2014 \n 'Tis better far to know the use of \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1, \n \n And \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, and Sardian ornaments, \n Than all the fashions in the Peloponnesus. \n And when he speaks of Sardian ornaments, he means to include perfumes;\n since the Lydians were very notorious for their luxury. And so Anacreon uses the\n word \u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u1f74\u03c2 (Lydian-like) as equivalent to\n \u1f21\u03b4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u1f74\u03c2 (luxurious). Sophocles also uses the\n word \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2; and Magnes, in his Lydians, says\u2014\n \n A man should bathe, and then with baccaris \n Anoint himself. \n Perhaps, however, \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd and \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 were not exactly the same thing; for Aeschylus,\n in his Amymone, makes a distinction between them, and says\u2014 \n Your \u03b2\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 and your \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1. \n \n And Simonides says\u2014 \n And then with \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, , and rich spices\n too, \n And \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, did I anoint myself. \n And Aristophanes, in his Thesmophoriazus\u00e6, says\u2014 \n \n O venerable Jove! with what a scent \n Did that vile bag, the moment it was open'd, \n O'erwhelm me, full of \u03b2\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 and \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. ! \n \n \n \n ","41":"\n Pherecrates mentions an unguent, which he calls \u03b2\u03c1\u03ad\u03bd\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, in his Trifles, saying\u2014 \n I stood, and order'd him to pour upon us \n Some brenthian unguent, that he also might \n Pour it on those departing. \n And Crates mentions what he calls royal unguent, in his Neighbours;\n speaking as follows:\u2014 \n He smelt deliciously of royal unguent. \n But Sappho mentions the royal and the brenthian unguent together, as if\n they were one and the same thing; saying\u2014 \n \n \u03b2\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u0390\u1ff3 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b7\u0390\u1ff3, \n \n Aristophanes speaks of an unguent which he calls \u03c8\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, in his Daitaleis; saying\u2014 \n Come, let me see what unguent I can give you: \n Do you like \u03c8\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3? \n \n And Eupolis, in his Marica, says\u2014 \n All his breath smells of \u03c8\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2. \n \n Eubulus, in his Female Garland-sellers, says\u2014 \n She thrice anointed with Egyptian psagdas ( \u03c8\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9 ). \n Polemo, in his writings addressed to Ad\u00e6us, says that there is an unguent\n in use among the Eleans called plangonium, from having been invented by a man\n named Plangon. And Sosibins says the same in his Similitudes; adding, that the\n unguent called megallium is so named for a similar reason: for that that was\n invented by a Sicilian whose name was Megallus. But some say that Megallus was an\n Athenian: and Aristophanes mentions him in his Telmissians, and so does\n Pherecrates in his Petale; and Strattis, in his Medea, speaks thus:\u2014 \n And say that you are bringing her such unguents, \n As old Megallus never did compound, \n Nor Dinias, that great Egyptian, see, \n Much less possess. \n Amphis also, in his Ulysses, mentions the Megalli unguent in the\n following passage\u2014 \n \n A.

But Theodorus says, that\n sagda is a species of spice used in fumigation. \n ","43":"\n Now a cotyla of unguent used to be sold for a high price at Athens, even, as\n Hipparchus says in his Nocturnal Festival, for as much as five mine; but as\n Menander, in his Misogynist, states, for ten. And Antiphanes, in his Phrearrus,\n where he is speaking of the unguent called stacte, says\u2014 \n The stacte at two min\u00e6's not worth having. \n Now the citizens of Sardis were not the only people addicted to the use\n of unguents, as Alexis says in his Maker of Goblets\u2014 \n The whole Sardian people is of unguents fond; \n but the Athenians also, who have always been the leaders of every\n refinement and luxury in human life, used them very much; so\n that among them, as has been already mentioned, they used to fetch an enormous\n price; but, nevertheless, they did not abstain from the use of them on that\n account; just as we now do not deny ourselves scents which are so expensive and\n exquisite that those things are mere trifles which are spoken of in the Settler of\n Alexis\u2014 \n For he did use no alabaster box \n From which t' anoint himself; for this is but \n An ordinary, and quite old-fashion'd thing. \n But he let loose four doves all dipp'd in unguents, \n Not of one kind, but each in a different sort; \n And then they flew around, and hovering o'er us, \n Besprinkled all our clothes and tablecloths. \n Envy me not, ye noble chiefs of Greece; \n For thus, while sacrificing, I myself \n Was sprinkled o'er with unguent of the iris. \n \n \n ","44":"\n Just think, in God's name, my friends, what luxury, or I should rather say, what\n profuse waste it was to have one's garments sprinkled in this manner, when a man\n might have taken up a little unguent in his hands, as we do now, and in that\n manner have anointed his whole body, and especially his head. For Myronides says,\n in his treatise on Unguents and Garlands, that the fashion of anointing the\n head at banquets arose from this:\u2014that those men whose heads are naturally dry,\n find the humours which are engendered by what they eat, rise up into their\n heads; and on this account, as their bodies are inflamed by fevers, they bedew\n their heads with lotions, so as to prevent the neighbouring humours from rising\n into a part which is dry, and which also has a considerable vacuum in it. And\n so at their banquets, having consideration for this fact, and being afraid of\n the strength of the wine rising into their heads, men have introduced the\n fashion of anointing their heads, and by these means the wine, they think, will\n have less effect upon then, if they make their head thoroughly wet first. And\n as men are never content with what is merely useful, but are always desirous to\n add to that whatever tends to pleasure and enjoyment; in that way they have\n been led to adopt the use of unguents. \n \n We ought, therefore, my good cynic Theodorus, to use at banquets those unguents\n which have the least tendency to produce heaviness, and to employ those which have\n astringent or cooling properties very sparingly. But\n Aristotle, that man of most varied learning, raises the question, Why men\n who use unguents are more grey than others? Is it because unguents have drying\n properties by reason of the spices used in their composition, so that they who\n use them become dry, and the dryness produces greyness? For whether greyness\n arises from a drying of the hair, or from a want of natural heat, at all events\n dryness has a withering effect. And it is on this account too that the use of\n hats makes men grey more quickly; for by them the moisture which ought to\n nourish the hair is taken away. \n \n ","45":"\n But when I was reading the twenty-eighth book of the History of Posidonius, I\n observed, my friends, a very pleasant thing which was said about unguents, and\n which is not at all foreign to our present discussion. For the philosopher says\n \u2014 In Syria, at the royal banquets, when the garlands are given to the\n guests, some slaves come in, having little bladders full of Babylonian\n perfumes, and going round the room at a little distance from the guests, they\n bedew their garlands with the perfumes, sprinkling nothing else. And\n since the discussion has brought us to this point, I will add \n A verse to Love, \n as the bard of Cythera says, telling you that Janus, who is worshipped as\n a great god by us, and whom we call Janus Pater, was the original inventor of\n garlands. And Dracon of Corcyra tells us this in his treatise on Precious Stones,\n where his words are\u2014 But it is said that Janus had two faces, the one\n looking forwards and the other backwards; and that it is from him that the\n mountain Janus and the river Janus are both named, because he used to live on\n the mountain. And they say that he was the first inventor of garlands, and\n boats, and ships; and was also the first person who coined brazen money. And on\n this account many cities in Greece, and many in Italy and Sicily, place on\n their coins a head with two faces, and on the obverse a boat, or a garland, or\n a ship. And they say that he married his sister Camise, and had a son named\n Aethax, and a daughter Olistene. And he, aiming at a more extended power and\n renown, sailed over to Italy, and settled on a mountain near Rome, which was\n called Janiculum from his name. \n \n ","46":"\n This, now, is what was said about perfumes and unguents. And after this most of\n them asked for wine, some demanding the Cup of the Good\n Deity, others that of Health, and different people invoking different deities; and\n so they all fell to quoting the words of those poets who had mentioned libations\n to these different deities; and I will now recapitulate what they said, for they\n quoted Antiphanes, who, in his Clowns, says\u2014 \n Harmodius was invoked, the paean sung, \n Each drank a mighty cup to Jove the Saviour. \n And Alexis, in his Usurer, or The Liar, says\u2014 \n \n A. Fill now the cup with the libation due \n To Jove the Saviour; for he surely is \n Of all the gods most useful to mankind. \n \n B. Your Jove the Saviour, if I were to burst, \n Would nothing do for me. \n \n A. Just drink, and trust him. \n And Nicostratus, in his Pandrosos, says\u2014 \n And so I will, my dear; \n But fill him now a parting cup to Health; \n Here, pour a due libation out to Health. \n Another to Good Fortune. Fortune manages \n All the affairs of men; but as for Prudence,\u2014 \n That is a blind irregular deity. \n And in the same play he mentions mixing a cup in honour of the Good\n Deity, as do nearly all the poets of the old comedy; but Nicostratus speaks thus\u2014\n \n Fill a cup quickly now to the Good Deity, \n And take away this table from before me; \n For I have eaten quite enough;\u2014I pledge \n This cup to the Good Deity;\u2014here, quick, I say, \n And take away this table from before me. \n Xenarchus, too, in his Twins, says\u2014 \n And now when I begin to nod my head, \n The cup to the Good Deity * * \n * * * * \n That cup, when I had drain'd it, near upset me; \n And then the next libation duly quaff'd \n To Jove the Saviour, wholly wreck'd my boat, \n And overwhelm'd me as you see. \n And Eriphus, in his Melib\u0153a, says\u2014 \n Before he'd drunk a cup to the Good Deity, \n Or to great Jove the Saviour. \n \n \n ","47":"\n And Theophrastus, in his essay on Drunkenness, says\u2014 The unmixed wine which\n is given at a banquet, which they call the pledge-cup in honour of the Good\n Deity, they offer in small quantities, as if reminding the guests of its\n strength, and of the liberality of the god, by the mere\n taste. And they hand it round when men are already full, in order that there\n may be as little as possible drunk out of it. And having paid adoration three\n times, they take it from the table, as if they were entreating of the gods that\n nothing may be done unbecomingly, and that they may not indulge in immoderate\n desires for this kind of drink, and that they may derive only what is\n honourable and useful from it. And Philochorus, in the second book of\n his Atthis, says\u2014 And a law was made at that time, that after the solid food\n is removed, a taste of the unmixed wine should be served round as a sort of\n sample of the power of the Good Deity, but that all the rest of the wine should\n be previously mixed; on which account the Nymphs had the name given them of\n Nurses of Bacchus. And that when the pledge-cup to the Good Deity was\n handed round, it was customary to remove the tables, is made plain by the wicked\n action of Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. For there was a table of gold placed\n before the statue of Aesculapius at Syracuse; and so Dionysius, standing before\n it, and drinking a pledge-cup to the Good Deity, ordered the table to be\n removed. \n But among the Greeks, those who sacrifice to the Sun, as Phylarchus tells us in\n the twelfth book of his History, make their libations of honey, as they never\n bring wine to the altars of the gods; saying that it is proper that the god who\n keeps the whole universe in order, and regulates everything, and is always going\n round and superintending the whole, should in no respect be connected with\n drunkenness. \n ","48":"\n Most writers have mentioned the Attic Scolia; and they are worthy also of being\n mentioned by me to you, on account of the antiquity and simple style of\n composition of the authors, and of those especially who gained a high reputation\n for that description of poetry, Alc\u00e6us and Anacreon; as Aristophanes says in his\n Daitaleis, where we find this line\u2014 \n Come, then. a scolium sing to me, \n Of old Alc\u00e6us or Anacreon. \n Praxilla, the Sicyonian poetess, was also celebrated for the composition\n of scolia. Now they are called scolia, not because of the character of the verse\n in which they are written, as if it were \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \n (crooked); for men call also those poems written in a laxer\n kind of metre \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac. But, as there are\n three kinds of songs (as Artemo of Cassandra says in the second book of\n his treatise on the Use of Books), one or other of which comprehends\n everything which is sung at banquets; the first kind is that which it was usual\n for the whole party to sing; the second is that which the whole party indeed\n sang, not, however, together, but going round according to some kind of\n succession; the third is that which is ranked lowest of all, which was not sung\n by all the guests, but only by those who seemed to understand what was to be\n done, wherever they might happen to be sitting; on which account, as having\n some irregularity in it beyond what the other kinds had, in not being sung by\n all the guests, either together or in any definite kind of succession, but just\n as it might happen, it was called \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd. And\n songs of this kind were sung when the ordinary songs, and those in which every\n one was bound to join, had come to an end. For then they invited all the more\n intelligent of the guests to sing some song worth listening to. And what they\n thought worth listening to were such songs as contained some exhortations and\n sentiments which seemed useful for the purposes of life. \n \n ","49":"\n And of these Deipnosophists, one quoted one scolium, and one another.

And he rested the\n charge of impiety on the fact of his having been accustomed to sing at banquets a\n p\u00e6an addressed to Hermias. But that this song has no characteristic whatever of a\n paean, but is a species of scolium, I will show you plainly from its own language\u2014\n \n O virtue, never but by labour to be won, \n First object of all human life, \n For such a prize as thee \n There is no toil, there is no strife, \n Nor even death which any Greek would shun; \n Such is the guerdon fair and free, \n And lasting too, with which thou dost thy followers grace,\u2014 \n Better than gold, \n Better than sleep, or e'en the glories old \n Of high descent and noble race. \n For you Jove's mighty son, great Hercules, \n Forsook a life of ease; \n For you the Spartan brothers twain \n Sought toil and danger, following your behests \n With fearless and unwearied breasts. \n Your love it was that fired and gave \n To early grave \n Achilles and the giant son \n Of Salaminian Telamon. \n And now for you Atarneus' pride, \n Trusting in others' faith, has nobly died; \n But yet his name \n Shall never die, the Muses' holy train \n Shall bear him to the skies with deathless fame, \n Honouring Jove, the hospitable god, \n And honest hearts, proved friendship's blest abode. \n \n \n ","51":"\n Now I don't know whether any one can detect in this any resemblance to a paean,\n when the author expressly states in it that Hermias is dead, when he says\u2014 \n And now for you Atarneus' pride, \n Trusting in others' faith, has nobly died. \n Nor has the song the burden, which all paeans have, of Io Paean, as that\n song written on Lysander the Spartan, which really is a paean, has; a song which\n Duris, in his book entitled The Annals of the Samians, says is sung in Samos. That\n also was a p\u00e6an which was written in honour of Craterus the Macedonian, of which\n Alexinus the logician was the author, as Hermippus the pupil of Callimachus says\n in the first book of his Essay on Aritotle. And this song is sung at Delphi, with\n a boy playing the lyre as an accompaniment to it. The song,\n too, addressed to Agemon of Corinth, the father of Alcyone, which the Corinthians\n sang, contains the burden of the paean. And this burden, too, is even added by\n Polemo Periegetes to his letter addressed to Aranthius. The song also which the\n Rhodians sing, addressed to Ptolemy the first king of Egypt, is a paean: for it\n contains the burden Io Paean, as Georgus tells us in his essay on the Sacrifices\n at Rhodes. And Philochorus says that the Athenians sing paeans in honour of\n Antigonus and Demetrius, which were composed by Hermippus of Cyzicus, on an\n occasion when a great many poets had a contest as to which could compose the\n finest paean, and the victory was adjudged to Hermippus. And, indeed, Aristotle\n himself, in his Defence of himself from this accusation of impiety, (unless the\n speech is a spurious one,) says\u2014 For if I had wished to offer sacrifice to\n Hermias as an immortal being, I should never have built him a tomb as a mortal;\n nor if I had wished to make him out to be a god, should I have honoured him\n with funeral obsequies like a man. \n \n ","52":"\n When Democritus had said this, Cynulcus said;;\u2014Why do you remind me of those\n cyclic poems, to use the words of your friend Philo, when you never ought to say\n anything serious or important in the presence of this glutton Ulpian? For he\n prefers lascivious songs to dignified ones; such, for instance, as those which are\n called Locrian songs, which are of a debauched sort of character, such as\u2014 \n Do you not feel some pleasure now? \n Do not betray me, I entreat you. \n Rise up before the man comes back, \n Lest he should ill-treat you and me. \n 'Tis morning now, dost thou not see \n The daylight through the windows? \n And all Ph\u0153nicia is full of songs of this kind; and he him- self, when\n there, used to go about playing on the flute with the men who sing colabri. And there is good authority, Ulpian, for this word \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9. For Demetrius the Scepsian, in the tenth book\n of his Trojan Array, speaks thus:\u2014 \"Ctesiphon the Athenian, who was a composer of\n the songs called \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, was made by Attalus,\n who succeeded Philet\u00e6rus as king of Pergamus, judge of all his subjects in the Aeolian district.\" And the same writer, in the nineteenth\n book of the same work, says that Seleucus the composer of merry songs was the son\n of Mnesiptolemus, who was an historian, and who had great interest with that\n Antiochus who was surnamed the Great. And it was very much the fashion to sing\n this song of his\u2014 \n I will choose a single life, \n That is better than a wife; \n Friends in war a man stand by, \n While the wife stays at home to cry. \n \n \n ","53":"\n And after this, looking towards Ulpian, he said;\u2014 But since you are out of humour\n with me, I will explain to you what the Syrben\u00e6an chorus is. And Ulpian said;\u2014Do\n you think, you wretch, that I am angry at what you say, or even that I pay the\n least attention to it, you shameless hound? But since you profess to teach me\n something, I will make a truce with you, not for thirty, but for a hundred years;\n only tell me what the Syrben\u00e6an chorus is. Then, said he, Clearchus, my good\n friend, in the second book of his treatise on Education, writes thus\u2014 There\n remains the Syrben\u00e6an chorus, in which every one is bound to sing whatever he\n pleases, without paying the least attention to the man who sits in the post of\n honour and leads the chorus. And indeed he is only a more noisy\n spectator. And in the words of Matron the parodist\u2014 \n For all those men who heroes were of old, \n Eub\u00e6us, and Hermogenes, and Philip, \n Are dead, and settlers in dark Pluto's realms; \n But Cleonicus has a life secure \n From all th' attacks of age; he's deeply skill'd \n In all that bards or theatres concerns; \n And even now he's dead, great Proserpine \n Allows his voice still to be heard on earth. \n But you, even while you are alive, ask questions about everything, but\n never give information on any subject yourself. And he replied, who. . . .? while\n the truce between us lasts. \n ","54":"\n And Cynulcus said;\u2014There have been many poets who have applied themselves to the\n composition of parodies, my good friend; of whom the most celebrated was Eub\u0153us of\n Paros, who lived in the time of Philip; and he is the man who attacked the\n Athenians a great deal. And four books of his Parodies are preserved. And Timon\n also mentions him, in the first book of his Silli. But\n Polemo, in the twelfth book of his Argument against Tim\u00e6us, speaking of the men\n who have written parodies, writes thus\u2014\"And I should call B\u0153otus and Eub\u0153us, who\n wrote parodies, men of great reputation, on account of their cleverness in\n sportive composition, and I consider that they surpass those ancient poets whose\n followers they were. Now, the invention of this kind of poetry we must attribute\n to Hipponax the Iambic poet. For he writes thus, in his Hexameters,\u2014 \n Muse, sing me now the praises of Eurymedon, \n That great Charybdis of the sea, who holds \n A sword within his stomach, never weary \n With eating. Tell me how the votes may pass \n Condemning him to death, by public judgment, \n On the loud-sounding shore of the barren sea. \n Epicharmus of Syracuse also uses the same kind of poetry, in a small\n degree, in some of his plays; and so does Cratinus, a poet of the old Comedy, in\n his Eunid\u00e6, and so also does his contemporary, Hegemon of Thasos, whom they used\n to call Lentil. For he writes thus\u2014 \n And when I Thasos reach'd they took up filth, \n And pelted me therewith, by which aroused \n Thus a bystander spoke with pitiless heart:\u2014 \n O most accursed of men, who e'er advised you \n To put such dirty feet in such fine slippers? \n And quickly I did this brief answer make:\u2014 \n 'Twas gain that moved me, though against my will, \n (But I am old;) and bitter penury; \n Which many Thasians also drives on shipboard, \n Ill-manner'd youths, and long-ruin'd old men: \n Who now sing worthless songs about the place. \n Those men I join'd when fit for nothing else; \n But I will not depart again for gain, \n But doing nothing wrong, I'll here deposit \n My lovely money among the Thasians: \n Lest any of the Grecian dames at home \n Should be enraged when they behold my wife \n Making Greek bread, a poor and scanty meal. \n Or if they see a cheesecake small, should say,\u2014 \n \"Philion, who sang the 'Fierce Attack' at Athens, \n Got fifty drachmas, and yet this is all \n That you sent home.\"\u2014While I was thinking thus, \n And in my mind revolving all these things, \n Pallas Minerva at my side appeared, \n And touch'd me with her golden sceptre, saying, \n \"O miserable and ill-treated man, \n Poor Lentil, haste thee to the sacred games.\" \n Then I took heart, and sang a louder strain. \n \n \n \n ","55":"\n \"Hermippus also, the poet of the old Comedy, composed parodies. But the first\n writer of this kind who ever descended into the arena of theatrical contests was\n Hegemon, and he gained the prize at Athens for several parodies; and among them,\n for his Battle of the Giants. He also wrote a comedy in the ancient fashion, which\n is called Philinna. Eub\u0153us also was a man who exhibited a good deal of wit in his\n poems; as, for instance, speaking about the Battle of the Baths, he said\u2014 \n They one another smote with brazen \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9, \n \n [as if \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, , instead of meaning a\n spear, were derived from \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, to pour in.] And\n speaking of a barber who was being abused by a potter on account of some woman, he\n said\u2014 \n But seize not, valiant barber, on this prize, \n Nor thou Achilles . . . . . \n \n And that these men were held in high estimation among the Sicilians, we\n learn from Alexander the Aetolian, a composer of tragedies, who, in an elegy,\n speaks as follows:\u2014 \n The man whom fierce Agathocles did drive \n An exile from his land, was nobly born \n Of an old line of famous ancestors, \n And from his early youth he lived among \n The foreign visitors; and thoroughly learnt \n The dulcet music of Mimnermus' lyre, \n And follow'd his example;\u2014and he wrote, \n In imitation of great Homer's verse, \n The deeds of cobblers, and base shameless thieves, \n Jesting with highly-praised felicity, \n Loved by the citizens of fair Syracuse. \n But he who once has heard B\u0153otus' song, \n Will find but little pleasure in Eub\u0153us.\" \n \n \n ","56":"\n After all this discussion had been entered into on many occasions, once when\n evening overtook us, one of us said,\u2014Boy, bring a light ( \u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ). But some one else used the word \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u1f7c\u03c2, and a third called it \u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, saying hat that was the proper name for a torch made of\n bark; another called it \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2; and another\n \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2. \u2014This one used the word \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, and that one \u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. Some one else again said \u1f10\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7, and another said \u1f15\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \n insisting on it that that was the proper name for a lamp, being derived frome\n \u1f15\u03bb\u03b7, , brightness; and\n urging that Neanthes used this word in the first book of his History of Attalus.\n Others, again, of the party made use of whatever other words they fancied; so that\n there was no ordinary noise; while all were vying with one another in adducing\n every sort of argument which bore upon the question. For one man said that\n Silenus, the dictionary-maker, mentioned that the Athenians call lamps \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af. But Tima- chidas of Rhodes asserts that for\n \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, the word more properly used is \u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, being a sort of lantern which young men use\n when out at night, and which they themselves call \u1f15\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. But Amerias for \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 uses\n the word \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. And this word is thus explained\n by Seleucus:\u2014 \n \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd is a stick of ilex or common oak,\n which, being pounded and split, is set on fire, and used to give light to\n travellers. Accordingly Theodoridas of Syracuse, in his Centaurs, which is a\n dithyrambic poem, says\u2014 \n The pitch dropp'd down beneath the \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b9\u03b1, , \n As if from torches. \n Strattis also, mentions the \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b9\u03b1 in\n his Ph\u0153nician Women. \n \n ","57":"\n But that what are now called \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1f76 used to be\n called \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9, we learn from Aristophanes, in\n his Aeolosicon\u2014 \n I see the light shining all o'er his cloak, \n As from a new \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. \n \n And, in the second edition of the Niobus, having already used the word\n \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, he writes\u2014 \n Alas, unhappy man! my \u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd 's lost; \n after which, he adds\u2014 And, in his play called The Dramas, he calls the\n same thing \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, in the following lines\u2014\n \n But you all lie \n Fast as a candle in a candlestick ( \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ). \n Plato also, in his Long Night, says\u2014 \n The undertakers sure will have \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9. \n \n And Pherecrates, in his Slave Teacher, writes\u2014 \n Make haste and go, for now the night descends, \n And bring a lantern ( \u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd ) with a\n candle furnish'd. \n Alexis too, in his Forbidden Thing, says\u2014 \n So taking out the candle from the lantern ( \u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ), \n He very nearly set himself on fire, \n Carrying the light beneath his arm much nearer \n His clothes than any need at all required. \n \n And Eumelus, in his Murdered Man. . . . having said first\u2014\n \n \n A.

And when the Python attacked them, Latona, holding one of her children\n in her arms, got upon the stone which even now lies at the foot of the brazen\n statue of Latona, which is dedicated as a representation of what then took\n place near the Plane-tree at Delphi, and cried out \u1fde\u1f35\u03b5,\n \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6; (and Apollo happened to have his bow in hand;) and this is\n the same as if she had said \u1fce\u1f04\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5, \u1fde\u03b9\u03b5, \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6, or\n \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5, \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6, Shoot, boy.

And many also, when they have completed any undertaking, say,\n as a sort of proverb, \u1f30\u1f74 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd; but since it is\n an expression that is familiar to us it is forgotten that it is a proverb, and\n they who use it are not aware that they are uttering a proverb. \n \n But as for what Heraclides of Pontus says, that is clearly a mistake, That\n the god himself, while offering a libation, thrice cried out \u1f35\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u1f70\u03bd, \u1f35\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd. \n From a belief in which statement he refers the trimeter verse, as it is\n called to the god, saying \"that each of these metres belongs to the god; because when the first two syllables are made long, \u1f35\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u1f70\u03bd, it becomes a heroic verse, but when they are\n pronounced short it is an iambic, and thus it is plain that we must attribute the\n iambic to him. And as the rest are short, if any one makes the last two syllables\n of the verse long, that makes a Hipponactean iambic. \n ","62":"\n And after this, when we also were about to leave the party, the slaves came in\n bringing, one an incense burner, and another. . . . . . . . . . \n For it was the custom for the guests to rise up and offer a libation, and then to\n give the rest of the unmixed wine to the boy, who brought it to them to drink. \n Ariphron the Sicyonian composed this P\u00e6an to Health\u2014 \n O holiest Health, all other gods excelling, \n May I be ever blest \n With thy kind favour, and for all the rest \n Of life I pray thee ne'er desert my dwelling; \n For if riches pleasure bring, \n Or the power of a king, \n Or children smiling round the board, \n Or partner honour'd and adored, \n Or any other joy \n Which the all-bounteous gods employ \n To raise the hearts of men, \n Consoling them for long laborious pain; \n All their chief brightness owe, kind Health, to you; \n You are the Graces' spring, \n 'Tis you the only real bliss can bring, \n And no man's blest when you are not in view, \n * * * * * * \n \n \n ","63":"\n They know.\u2014For Sopater the farce-writer, in his play entitled The Lentil, speaks\n thus\u2014 \n I can both carve and drink Etruscan wine, \n In due proportion mix'd. \n \n \n These things, my good Timocrates, are not, as Plato says, the sportive\n conversations of Socrates in his youth and beauty, but the serious discussions of\n the Deipnosophists; for, as Dionysius the Brazen says,\u2014 \n What, whether you begin or end a work, \n Is better than the thing you most require? \n \n \n "}},"commit":"af9982f35cd5f36f9bcbfe25aba3b3e677326ff5","author":"athenaeus of naucratis"}
