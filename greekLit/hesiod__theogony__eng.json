That bird Heracles, the valiant son of\n shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from\n the cruel plague, and released him from his affliction\u2014not\n without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high,","112":"that the glory of Heracles the\n Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous\n earth. This, then, he regarded, and honored his famous son; though he\n was angry, he ceased from the wrath which he had before because\n Prometheus matched himself in wit with the almighty son of\n Cronos.","113":"For when the gods\n and mortal men had a dispute at Mecone, even then Prometheus was\n forward to cut up a great ox and set portions before them, trying to\n deceive the mind of Zeus. Before the rest he set flesh and inner parts\n thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox\n paunch;","114":"but for Zeus he put\n the white bones dressed up with cunning art and covered with shining\n fat.

But Zeus, whose\n wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and\n in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to\n be fulfilled. With both hands he took up the white fat and was angry\n at heart, and wrath came to his spirit","117":"when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out: and\n because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the\n deathless gods upon fragrant altars. But Zeus who drives the clouds\n was greatly vexed and said to him: \u201cSon of Iapetus, clever above\n all!","118":"So, sir, you have not\n yet forgotten your cunning arts!\u201d So spake Zeus in anger, whose\n wisdom is everlasting; and from that time he was always mindful of the\n trick, and would not give the power of unwearying fire to the\n Melian race of\n mortal men who live on the earth.","119":"But the noble son of Iapetus outwitted him and stole the far-seen\n gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk. And Zeus who\n thunders on high was stung in spirit, and his dear heart was angered\n when he saw amongst men the far-seen ray of fire.","120":"Forthwith he made an evil thing for\n men as the price of fire; for the very famous Limping God formed of\n earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos willed. And\n the goddess bright-eyed Athena girded and clothed her with silvery\n raiment, and down from her head","121":"she spread with her hands an embroidered veil, a wonder to see; and\n she, Pallas Athena, put about her head lovely garlands, flowers of\n new-grown herbs. Also she put upon her head a crown of gold which the\n very famous Limping God made himself","122":"and worked with his own hands as a favor to Zeus his\n father. On it was much curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many\n creatures which the land and sea rear up, he put most upon it,\n wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty\n shone out from it.\n \n\n \n ","123":"But when he had made the\n beautiful evil to be the price for the blessing, he brought her out,\n delighting in the finery which the bright-eyed daughter of a mighty\n father had given her, to the place where the other gods and men were.\n And wonder took hold of the deathless gods and mortal men when they\n saw that which was sheer guile, not to be withstood by men. ","124":"For from her is the race of women and\n female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live\n amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful\n poverty, but only in wealth. And as in thatched hives bees","125":"feed the drones whose nature is to do\n mischief\u2014by day and throughout the day until the sun goes down\n the bees are busy and lay the white combs, while the drones stay at\n home in the covered hives and reap the toil of others into their own\n bellies\u2014","126":"even so Zeus\n who thunders on high made women to be an evil to mortal men, with a\n nature to do evil. And he gave them a second evil to be the price for\n the good they had: whoever avoids marriage and the sorrows that women\n cause, and will not wed, reaches deadly old age","127":"without anyone to tend his years, and though he\n at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives, yet, when he is\n dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them. And as for the\n man who chooses the lot of marriage and takes a good wife suited to\n his mind, evil continually contends with good;","128":"for whoever happens to have mischievous children,\n lives always with unceasing grief in his spirit and heart within him;\n and this evil cannot be healed. So it is not possible to deceive or go\n beyond the will of Zeus: for not even the son of Iapetus, kindly\n Prometheus,","129":"escaped his\n heavy anger, but of necessity strong bands confined him, although he\n knew many a wile.\n \n\n \n But when first their father was vexed in his heart with Obriareus and\n Cottus and Gyes, he bound them in cruel bonds, because he was jealous\n of their exceeding manhood and comeliness","130":"and great size: and he made them live beneath the\n wide-pathed earth, where they were afflicted, being set to dwell under\n the ground, at the end of the earth, at its great borders, in bitter\n anguish for a long time and with great grief at heart. But the son of\n Cronos and the other deathless gods","131":"whom rich-haired Rhea bore from union with Cronos,\n brought them up again to the light at Earth's advising. For she\n herself recounted all things to the gods fully, how with these they\n might gain victory and a glorious cause to vaunt themselves.","132":"For the Titan gods and as many as\n sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war\n with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othrys, but the\n gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bore in union with Cronos,\n from Olympus .","133":"So they, with bitter wrath, were\n fighting continually with one another at that time for ten full years,\n and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue\n of the war hung evenly balanced. But when he had provided those three\n with all things fitting,","134":"nectar\n and ambrosia which the gods themselves eat, and when their proud\n spirit revived within them all after they had fed on nectar and\n delicious ambrosia, then it was that the father of men and gods spoke\n amongst them: \u201cHear me, bright children of Earth and\n Heaven,","135":"that I may say what\n my heart within me bids. A long while now have we, who are sprung from\n Cronos and the Titan gods, fought with each other every day to get\n victory and to prevail.

And blameless Cottus answered him again: \u201c","137":"Divine one, you speak that which we\n know well: no, even of ourselves we know that your wisdom and\n understanding is exceeding, and that you became a defender of the\n deathless ones from chill doom. And through your devising we have come\n back again from the murky gloom and from our merciless\n bonds,","138":"enjoying what we\n looked not for, O lord, son of Cronos. And so now with fixed purpose\n and deliberate counsel we will aid your power in dreadful strife and\n will fight against the Titans in hard battle.\u201d So he said: and\n the gods, givers of good things, applauded when","139":"they heard his word, and their spirit longed for\n war even more than before, and they all, both male and female, stirred\n up hated battle that day, the Titan gods, and all that were born of\n Cronos together with those dread, mighty ones of overwhelming\n strength","140":"whom Zeus brought\n up to the light from Erebus beneath the earth. A hundred arms sprang\n from the shoulders of all alike, and each had fifty heads growing from\n his shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the Titans\n in grim strife,","141":"holding huge\n rocks in their strong hands. And on the other part the Titans eagerly\n strengthened their ranks, and both sides at one time showed the work\n of their hands and their might. The boundless sea rang terribly\n around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken\n and","142":"groaned, and high\n Olympus reeled from its\n foundation under the charge of the undying gods, and a heavy quaking\n reached dim Tartarus and the deep sound of their feet in the fearful\n onset and of their hard missiles. So, then, they launched their\n grievous shafts upon one another,","143":"and the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to starry heaven;\n and they met together with a great battle-cry.\n \n\n \n Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was\n filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength.

The hot vapor\n lapped round the earthborn Titans: flame unspeakable rose to the\n bright upper air: the flashing glare of the thunderstone and lightning\n blinded their eyes for all that they were strong.","146":"Astounding heat seized Chaos: and to\n see with eyes and to hear the sound with ears it seemed even as if\n Earth and wide Heaven above came together; for such a mighty crash\n would have arisen if Earth were being hurled to ruin, and Heaven from\n on high were hurling her down;","147":"so great a crash was there while the gods were meeting together in\n strife. Also the winds brought rumbling earthquake and duststorm,\n thunder and lightning and the lurid thunderbolt, which are the shafts\n of great Zeus, and carried the clangor and the warcry into the midst\n of the two hosts. A horrible uproar","148":"of terrible strife arose: mighty deeds were shown and the\n battle inclined. But until then, they kept at one another and fought\n continually in cruel war. And amongst the foremost Cottus and Briareos\n and Gyes insatiate for war","149":"raised fierce fighting: three hundred rocks, one upon another, they\n launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the Titans with\n their missiles, and hurled them beneath the wide-pathed earth, and\n bound them in bitter chains when they had conquered them by their\n strength for all their great spirit,","150":"as far beneath the earth as heaven is above earth; for so\n far is it from earth to Tartarus.
