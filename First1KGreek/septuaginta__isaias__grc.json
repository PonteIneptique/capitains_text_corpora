For who hath\ndemanded this of your hands? Tread my court \n 13 Ye shall not, any more; if ye bring me \ufb01ne \ufb02our, it is vain;\nincense, it is an abomination to me; your new moons, and the\nsabbaths, and a great day, I cannot bear: fasting and idleness, \n 14 And your new moons, and your feasts, my soul hateth;\nye are become to me a surfeit! no longer will I let your sins be. \n 15 When ye stretch out your hands toward me, I will turn away\nmine eyes from you; and if ye multiply your petition, I will not\nlisten to you; for your hands are full of blood. \n 16 Wash you, become clean; take away your wickednesses\nfrom your souls before mine eyes; cease from your wickednesses, \n 17 Learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver one wronged,\njudge for the orphan, justify the widow. \n 18 And \u2019come, and let us be convicted, saith the Lord; and if\nyour sins be as a scarlet thing, I will make them white as snow;\nand if they be as crimson, I will make them white as wool. \n 19 And if ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the\ngood things of the land: \n 20 But if ye be not willing, neither hearken unto me, a sword \u2019\nshall devour you; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! she (that) was\nfull of judgment, righteousness lodged in her; but now murderers: \n 22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine impaired with water: \n 23 Thy princes (are) rebellious, and companions of thieves:\nevery one of them loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they\njudge not the fatherless, \u2019doth the cause of the widow\ncome unto them. \n 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the\nmighty one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and\navenge me of mine enemies. \n 25 And I will bring back mine hand upon thee, and purge\naway as (with) lye thy dross, and take away all thine alloy: \n 26 And I will restore thy judges as at the \ufb01rst, and thy\ncounsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called\nCitadel of righteousness, faithful city. \n 27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts\nwith righteousness. \n 28 And (there shall be) a shattering of the rebels and of the\nsinners together, and they that forsake the LORD shall come to an\nend. \n 29 For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have\ndesired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have\nchosen. \n 30 For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf withereth, and as\na garden that hath no water. \n 31 And the strong shall become as tow, and his work as a\nspark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench\nthem. \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 How is the faithful city Zion become a harlot! (once)\nfull of judgment, and in her righteousness did rest; but now\nmurderers. \n 22 Your silver is base; thy hucksters mix the wine with water: \n 23 Thy rulers are disobedient; companions of thieves, that\nlove gifts, that pursue a recompense; that judge not for orphans,\nand attend not to the cause of a widow. \n 24 Therefore thus saith the Ruler, the Lord of Hosts, Ah, the\nstrong ones of Israel! for my wrath shall not cease upon mine\nadversaries, and I will exact judgment from mine enemies. \n 25 And I will turn mine band upon thee, and burn thee into\npurity, and the disobedient will I destroy, and take away all\ntransgressors from thee, and will humble all arrogant ones. \n 26 And I will set up thy judges as in former time, and thy\ncounsellors as from the beginning; and after that thou shalt be\ncalled City of righteousness, faithful mother-city Zion. \n 27 For with judgment shall her captivity be saved, and with\nmercy. \n 28 And the transgressors and the sinners together shall be\nbroken in pieces, and they that forsake the Lord shall be brought to an end.\nto an end. \n 29 For they shall be ashamed for their idols, which themselves\ndesired, and shall be ashamed for their gardens, which they longed for. \n 30 For they shall be as a terebinth that hath cast off its leaves,\nand as a park with no water. \n 31 And their strength shall be as a stalk of \ufb02ax, and their\nworks as sparks of \ufb01re, and the transgressors and the sinners\nshall be burned up together, and there shall be none that shall\nquench them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n II. 1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning\nJudah and Jerusalem. \n 2 And it shall come to pass in the end of the days, the mountain\nof the \u2019S house shall be established in the top of the\nmountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all nations\nshall \ufb02ow unto it. \n 3 And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go\nup tothe mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of\nJacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his\npaths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the\nLORD from Jerusalem. \n 4 And he shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for\nmany peoples; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,\nand their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up\nsword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. \n 5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of\nthe LORD. \n 6 For thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob,\nbecause they be replenished from the East, and are soothsayers\nlike the Philistines, and strike hands with the children of aliens. \n 7 And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any\nend of their treasures; and their land is full of horses, neither is\nthere any end of their chariots: \n 8 And their land is full of false gods: they worship the work\nof their own hands, that which their own \ufb01ngers have made: \n 9 And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is\nbrought low; and forgive them not. \n \n\n \n II. I The word that came from the Lord to Isaiah the son\nof Amoz concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem \n 2 For in the last days shall the mountain of the Lord be\nclearly seen, and the house of God upon the top of the mountains,\nand it shall be uplifted above the hills, and all the nations shall\ncome unto it. \n 3 And many nations shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up\ninto the mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of\nJacob; and he will proclaim to us his way, and we will walk in it.\nFor out of Zion shall a law come forth, and the word of the Lord\nfrom Jerusalem. \n 4 And he shall judge between the nations, and shall convince\nmuch people; and they shall beat their Swords into ploughshares,\nand their spears into pruning hooks; and nation shall not any\nmore take a sword against nation, and they shall not learn to war\nany more. \n 5 And now, \u039f house of Jacob, come, let us walk by the light\nof the Lord. \n 6 For he hath given up his people, the house of Israel; because\ntheir country is \ufb01lled with omens, as at the \ufb01rst, like the land of\nthe Strangers, and many strange children are born to them. \n 7 For their country is \ufb01lled with silver and gold, and there\nis no number to their treasures; and their land is \ufb01lled with\nhorses, and there is no number to their chariots: \n 8 And the land is \ufb01lled with abominations, the works of their\nhands, and they worship things which their own \ufb01ngers have\nmade: \n 9 And a mean man boweth down, and a great man is humbled,\nand I will not let them be. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before\nthe fear of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty. \n 11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness\nof men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be\nexalted in that day. \n 12 For the LORD of Hosts hath a day upon every one that is\nproud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he\nshall be brought low: \n 13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up,\nand upon all the oaks of Bashan, \n 14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills\nthat are lifted up, \n 15 And upon every lofty tower, and upon every fenced wall, \n 16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all images of\ndesire; \n 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the\nhaughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall\nbe exalted in that day. \n 18 And the false gods\u2014the whole shall pass away. \n 19 And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the\nholes of the dust, from before the fear of the LORD, and from the\nglory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth. \n 20 In that day a man shall cast his false gods of silver, and his\nfalse gods of gold, which they made for him to worship, to the\nmoles and to the bats; \n 21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the crevices of\nthe crags, from before the fear of the LORD, and from the glory of\nhis majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth. \n 22 Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath; for\nwherein is he to be accounted of ? \n \n\n \n 10 And now, enter into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the\nearth, from before the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his\nstrength, when he ariseth to shatter the earth. \n 11 For the eyes of the Lord (are) lifted high, but man (is)\nhumble: and the uplifting of men shall be humbled, and the\nLord alone shall be uplifted in that day. \n 12 For there is a day of the Lord of Hosts against every\nworker of pride, and overweening one, and against every one that\nis high and lofty, and they shall be humbled: \n 13 And against every cedar of Lebanon, of them that are high\nand lofty, and against every oak-tree of Bashan, \n 14 And against every mountain, and against every high\nhill, \n 15 And against every high tower, and against every high\nwall, \n 16 And against every ship of the sea, and against every sight\nof the beauty of ships: \n 17 And every man shall be humbled. and the uplifting of men\nshall fall, and the Lord alone shall be uplifted in that day. \n 18. And all the works of men's hands shall they hide away, \n 19 Carrying them into the caves, and into the rents of the\nrocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the fear of the\nLord, and from the glory of his strength, when he ariseth to\nshatter the earth. \n 20 In that day shall a man cast out his abominations, the\nsilver and the golden, which he made to worship, to the vain ones\nand to the bats; \n 21 To go into the holes of the solid rock, and into the rents of\nthe rocks, from before the face of the Lord, and from the glory of\nhis strength, when he ariseth to shatter the earth.\n* * * * \n \n \n \n\n \n III. I For behold, the Lord, the LORD of Hosts, doth take\naway from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the\nwhole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, \n 2 Mighty man, and man of war, judge, and prophet, and\ndiviner, and elder, \n 3 Captain of \ufb01fty, and him that is high of face, and counsellor,\nand cunning artificer, and skilled enchanter, \n 4 And I will give children to be their princes, and freakishness\nshall rule over them. \n 5 And the people shall oppress one another, each against\nanother, and each against his neighbour; the child shall be\ninsolent against the ancient, and the vile against the honourable. \n 6 When a man shall take hold of his brother in) the house of\nhis father: Thou hast clothing, thou shalt be our ruler, and let\nthis ruin be under thy hand: \n 7 In that day shall he lift up (his voice) saying, I will not be a\nbinder up: for in my house is neither bread nor clothing; ye\nshall not make me a ruler of the people. \n 8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their\ntongue and their doings are against the LORD, to defy the eyes of\nhis glory. \n 9 The show of their face doth witness against them; and they\ndeclare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their\nsoul! for they have awarded evil unto themselves. \n 10 Say ye to the righteous, that it is well; for they shall eat the\nfruit of their doings. \n 11 Woe unto the wicked, it is ill! for the reward of his hands\nshall be given him. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n III. I Now behold, the ruler, the Lord of Hosts, will take\naway from Judah and from Jerusalem him that is strong and her\nthat is strong, the strength of bread and the strength of water, \n 2 Giant, and strong man, and man of war, and judge, and\nprophet, and diviner, and elder, \n 3 And captain of \ufb01fty, and wonderful counsellor, and skilful\nartificer, and understanding listener, \n 4 And I will set up youths as their rulers, and mockers shall\nlord it over them. \n 5 And the people shall fall together, each against another, and\neach against his neighbour; the child shall stumble against the\nelder, the dishonoured against the honourable. \n 6 For a man shall take hold of his brother, or of his father's\nkinsman, saying, Thou hast a cloke, be thou our leader, and let\nmy meat be subject to thee. \n 7 And he shall answer and say in that day, I will not be thy\nleader; for there is no bread in my house, neither a cloke; I will\nnot be a leader of this people. \n 8 For Jerusalem is abandoned, and Judah is fallen down; and\ntheir tongues (are) with transgression, (they are) disobedient\ntoward the Lord; wherefore now is their glory humbled. \n 9 And the shame of their face is risen up against them; and\nthey have proclaimed their sin as of Sodom, and made it plain.\nWoe unto their soul! for they have counselled evil counsel\nagainst themselves, \n 10 Saying, Let us bind the just, for he is of ill service to us:\ntherefore shall they eat the fruit of their works. \n 11 Woe to the transgressor \u1f15 evil shall befall him according to\nthe works of his hands. \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 My people, their oppressors are children, and women rule\nover them. My people, they which lead thee cause thee to err,\nand swallow up the way of thy paths. \n 13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the\npeoples. \n 14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his\npeople, and the princes thereof; and ye\u2014ye have eaten up\nvineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. \n 15 What mean ye, that ye crush my people, and grind the face\nof the poor? saith the Lord GOD of Hosts. \n 16 And the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are\nhaughty, and walk with throat stretched out and staring eyes;\ntripping along they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: \n 17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the-crown of the\nhead of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their\nsecret parts. \n 18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of the\nanklets, and headbands, and crescents, \n 19 The pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils, \n 20 The head-tires, and the stepping chains, and the sashes, and\nthe scent-boxes, and the amulets, \n 21 The (seal) rings, and nose-jewels, \n 22 The festal robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the\nsatchels, \n \n\n \n 12 My people, your exactors glean you, and the tax gatherers\nshall lord it over you: my people, they that call you happy cause\nyou to err, and confound the path of your feet. \n 13 But now shall the Lord stand up for judgment, and shall\nset up his people for judgment. \n 14 The Lord himself shall come to judgment with the elders\nof the people, and the rulers thereof. But ye, why did ye burn\nmy vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your houses? \n 15 Why do ye wrong my people, and shame the face of the\npoor? \n 16 Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Zion are\nuplifted, and walk with uplifted neck, and with winkings of the\neyes, and in the passage of their feet both sweeping their skirts\nand mincing with their feet the while, \n 17 (So) also shall God humble the principal daughters of Zion,\nand the Lord shall discover their form \n 18 In that day; and the Lord will take away the glory of their\napparel, and their adomments, and the braidings, and the fringes,\nand the crescents, \n 19 And the pendant, and the adornment of the face, \n 20 And the ordering of the adornment of their glory, and the\nbracelets, and the armlets, and the braiding (of hair), and the\nbangles, and the \ufb01nger rings, and the earrings, \n 21 And the garments edged with purple, and shaded with\npurple, \n 22 And the hangings about the house, and the Laconian\ngauzes, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 23 The glasses, and the linen shifts, and the turbans, and the\nscarfs. \n 24 And it shall be, instead of sweet spices there shall be\nrottenness; and instead of a girdle a rope; and instead of curled\nhair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;\nbrandinginstead of beauty. \n 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy might in the war. \n 26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be\nemptied; on the ground shall she sit. \n IV. I And in that day seven women shall take hold of\none man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own\napparel; only let thy name be called upon us; take away our\nreproach. \n 2 In that day. shall the sprout of the LORD be for ornament\nand for glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be for pride and for\nbeauty to them that are escaped of Israel. \n 3 And it shall be, that he that is left in Zion, and remaineth\nin Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written down\nfor living in Jerusalem. \n 4 When the Lord shall have washed away the \ufb01lth of the\ndaughters of Zion, and shall have purged away the blood of\nJerusalem from the midst of her by the spirit of judgment, and\nby the spirit of burning. \n 5 And the LORD will create upon every habitation of mount\nZion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud by day, and smoke, and\nthe shining of a \ufb02aming \ufb01re by night; for upon all the glory is a\ncanopy, \n\n \n 23 And the (garments) of \ufb01ne linen, and of blue, and scarlet,\nand the \ufb01ne linen embroidered with gold and with blue, and the\nreclining veils. \n 24 And there shall be, instead of a sweet smell, dust; and\ninstead of a girdle thou shalt gird thyself with a rope, and instead\nof the golden adornment of the head thou shalt have baldness\nbecause of thy works, and instead of the purple shaded robe thou\nshalt gird thyself about with sackcloth. \n 25 And thy son. the fairest, whom thou lovest, shall fall by\nthe sword, and your strong men shall fall by the sword, and shall\nbe humbled: \n 26 And the coffers of your ornaments shall mourn, and thou\nshalt be left alone, and shalt be trodden into the earth.\nIV. I And seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,\nWe will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing; only let\nthy name be called upon us; take away our reproach. \n 2 But in that day shall God shine in counsel with glory upon\nthe earth, to uplift and to glorify that which is left of Israel. \n 3 And it shall be, that which is left behind in Zion, and left\nin Jerusalem, they shall be called holy, all they who were written\nunto life in Jerusalem. \n 4 For the Lord shall cleanse the \ufb01lth of the sons and of the\ndaughters of Zion, and shall purge the blood from the midst of\nthem, by the spirit of judgment <and the spirit of birning> \n 5 And he shall come, and it shall be, every place of the mount\nZion, and all that is round about her; a cloud shall shadow it by\nday, and like as when smoke and as a light of \ufb01re burneth by\nnight; it shall be sheltered by all the glory (of the Lord), \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time\nfrom the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and\nfrom rain. \n v. I Let me, I pray, sing for my beloved a song of my\nloved one for his vineyard. My beloved bath a vineyard, on\na hill-top, the son of oil; \n 2 And he digged it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it\nwith the vine of Sorek, and built a tower in the midst of it, and\nalso hewed out a wine-fat therein; and he looked that it should\nbring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild-grapes. \n 3 And now, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and man of Judah,\njudge, I pray, betwixt me and my vineyard. \n 4 What is there yet to do to my vineyard, that I have not\ndone in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth\ngrapes, brought it forth wild-grapes? \n 5 And now let me, I pray, tell you what I will do to my\nvineyard; \u0399 will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be\nconsumed; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be\ntrodden down; \n 6 And I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned, nor\nhoed; and there shall come up briers and thorns; and I will\ncommand the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. \n 7 For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel,\nand the man of Judah his pleasant plant 3 and he looked for judg-\nment, and behold oppression; for righteousness, and behold a cry. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 And it shall be for a shadow from heat, and as a covering\nand a hiding place from stress and from rain storm. \n V. 1 Now will I sing for my beloved a song of my loved one\nfor my vineyard. My beloved hath a vineyard on a hill-top, in\na fertile place; \n 2 And I set a hedge around it, and fenced it, and planted\na vine of Sorek, and built a tower in the midst of it, and digged\na wine-fat therein; and I waited for it to bring forth a cluster of\ngrapes, and it brought forth thorns. \n 3 And now, man of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,\njudge ye betwixt me and my vineyard. \n 4 What shall I do yet for my vineyard, that I have not done\nfor it? because I waited for it to bring forth a cluster of grapes,\nbut it brought forth thorns. \n 5 But now I will declare to you what I will do to my vineyard;\nI will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be plundered; and\ndestroy the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down; \n 6 And I will abandon my vineyard, and it shall not be pruned,\nnor digged; and there shall come up into it thorns, as into\na waste place; and I will command the clouds, to shower no\nrain upon it. \n 7 For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel,\nand the man of Judah a beloved young plant; I waited for (him)\nto bring forth judgment, but he brought forth transgression, and\nnot righteousness, but a cry. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay \ufb01eld to\n\ufb01eld, till there is no room, and ye are made to dwell alone in the\nmidst of the earth! \n 9 In mine ears (said) the LORD of Hosts, If there be not many\nhouses desolate, great ones and fair, without inhabitant! \n 10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a\nhomer of seed shall yield an ephah. \n 11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they\nmay follow strong drink; that tarry late in the dusk, while wine\ninflames them! \n 12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,\nare their banquet; but they regard not the work of the LORD,\nneither consider the operation of his hands. \n 13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, for lack of\nknowledge: and their glory are men of famine, and their\nabundance dried up with thirst. \n 14 Therefore Sheol hath enlarged her appetite, and opened\nher mouth without measure: and her honour, and her abundance,\nand her uproar, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into her. \n 15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the\nmighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall\nbe. humbled: \n 16 And the LORD of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and\nGod that is holy sheweth himself holy in righteousness. \n 17 Then shall the lambs feed as (in) their pasture, and the\nwaste places of the fat ones shall sojourners eat. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 Woe, they that join house to house, and set \ufb01eld next to\n\ufb01eld, that they may rob somewhat from their neighbour; will ye\ndwell alone upon the earth? \n 9 For this was heard in the ears of the Lord of Hosts; For if\nhouses become many, they shall be a desolation; great ones and\nfair, and there shall be none that inhabit them. \n 10 For where ten yoke of oxen plough, it shall yield one jar,\nand he that soweth six bushels shall get three measures. \n 11 Woe, they that rise up early, and follow strong drink; that\ntarry till late; for wine shall burn them up. \n 12 For with harp, and psaltery, and tabrets, and pipes, drink\nthey their wine; but they regard not the works of the Lord,\nand the works of his hands they consider not. \n 13 Therefore is my people become captive, because they\nknow not the Lord; and is become a multitude of dead bodies,\nbecause of famine and thirst for water. \n 14 And Hades enlarged his appetite, and opened his mouth,\ncontinually; and her glorious, and great, and rich ones, and her\npestilences, shall descend. \n 15 And the mean man shall be humbled, and the great man\nshall be dishonoured, and the eyes that are lifted up shall be\nhumbled: \n 16 And the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and\nGod, the Holy One, shall be glorified in righteousness. \n 17 And they that are spoiled shall graze as bulls, and the\nwaste places of them that are taken away shall lambs eat. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 Woe, they that drag iniquity with cords of vanity, and\n(their) sin as it were with a cart rope: \n 19 That say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,\nthat we may see: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel\ndraw nigh and come, that we may know; \n 20 Woe, they that call evil good, and good evil; that put\ndarkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet,\nand sweet for bitter! \n 21 Woe, they that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in\ntheir own sight! \n 22 Woe, they that are mighty to drink wine, and men of\nstrength to \u2019strong drink: \n 23 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the\njustice of the just from him! \n 24 Therefore as the tongue of \ufb01re devoureth the stubble, and\nthe dry grass sinketh down in \ufb02ame, their root shall be as rottenness,\nand their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have\nrejected the law of the LORD of Hosts, and despised the word of\nthe Holy One of Israel. \n 25 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his\npeople, and he hath stretched \u2019 his hand against them, and\nhath smitten them; and the hills did tremble, and their carcases\nwere as refuse in the midst of the open places. For all this his\nanger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. \n 26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and\nwill hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and behold, they\nshall come with speed swiftly: \n \n\n \n 18 Woe, they that drag along their sins as with a long rcpe,\nand their transgressions as with a cow-hide chariot trace: \n 19 That say, Let him speedily bring near what he will do, that\nwe may see; and let the counsel of the Holy One &003C; of Israel\ncome, that we may perceive: \n 20 Woe, they that call evil good, and good evil; that set darkness\nas light, and light as darkness; that set bitter as sweet, and\nsweet as bitter! \n 21 Woe, they that are prudent in themselves, and have understanding\nin their own sight! \n 22 Woe, they that are strong among you, that drink wine, and\nthe powerful ones, that mingle the strong drink: \n 23 That justify the impious for \u2019 sake, and remove the\njustice of the just. \n 24 Therefore, like as a reed shall be burned by coals of fire.\nand burned up by blazing \ufb02ame, their root shall be as chaff, and\ntheir blossom shall go up as whirling dust: for they desired not\nthe law of the Lord of Hosts, but they provoked the oracle of <\nHoly One of > Israel. \n 25 And the Lord of Hosts was wroth with anger against his\npeople, and laid his hand upon them, and smote them; and the\nmountains were provoked (to anger), and their carcases became as\ndung in the midst of the way. Amid all this his wrath is not\nturned away, but his hand is still upraised. \n 26 Therefore he shall raise up a signal among the nations afar\noff, and shall hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and,\nbehold, quickly they come swiftly. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 27 None shall be weary, nor stumble among. them; none shall\nslumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,\nnor the latchet of their shoes be broken: \n 28 Whose arrows are sharpened, and all his bows bent, his\n\u2019 hoofs shall be counted like flint. and his wheels like. a\nwhirlwind: \n 29 His roar is like a \u2019; he shall roar like young lions;\nand he growleth, and seizeth the prey, and shall carry it away safe,\nand none shall deliver it. \n 30 And in that day he shall growl over him, as the growling of\nthe sea; and if one look unto the earth, behold darkness, distress,\nand light; it groweth dark in the heavens thereof. \n VI. 1 In the year that king Uzziah died saw I the Lord\nsitting \u2019upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train \ufb01lled the\ntemple. \n 2 Seraphim stood above him; each one had six wings; with\ntwain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and\nwith twain he did \ufb02y. \n 3 And one kept crying unto another, and saying, Holy, holy,\nholy, is the LORD of Hosts; all the earth is full of his glory. \n 4 And the bases of the thresholds were shaken at the voice (of\nhim) that cried, and the house began to fill with smoke. \n 5 And I said, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a\nman of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of\nunclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of\nHosts. \n 6 And there \ufb02ew one of the seraphim unto me, and in his\n\u2019 hand a live coal, which. he had taken with the tongs from OH the\naltar; \n \n \n\n \n 27 They shall not <hunger nor> grow weary, nor nod, nor\nsleep, nor shall they loose their girdles from their loins, nor shall\nthe thongs of their sandals be broken: \n 28 Whose darts are sharp, and their bows bent; their \u2019\nhoofs are as solid rock; the wheels of their chariots were counted\nas a whirlwind. \n 29 They spring like lions, and are come up like a \u2019s\nwhelp; and he shall take hold, and shall roar as a wild beast, and\nshall cast them out, and there shall be none that delivereth them, \n 30 And he shall roar because of them, in that day, as the voice\nof a surging sea; and they shall look upon the earth, and behold,\ncruel darkness in their dismay. \n VI. 1 And it came to pass, in the year that king Uzziah died,\nI saw the Lord seated upon a throne, (that was) high and lifted\nup, and the house was full of his glory. \n 2 And seraphim stood around him; each one had six wings;\nand with twain they covered their face, and with twain they\ncovered their feet, and with twain they did fly. \n 3 And they cried one to another and said, Holy, holy, holy, is\nthe Lord of Hosts; all the earth is full of his glory. \n 4 And the lintel was lifted up, at the voice with which they\ncried, and the house was \ufb01lled with smoke. \n 5 And I said, O wretched me, for I am amazed; for being\n(but) a man, and with impure lips, I dwell in the midst of a\npeople with impure lips: and I have seen the King, the Lord of\nHosts, with mine eyes. \n 6 And there was sent to me one of the seraphim, and in his\nhand he had a coal of \ufb01re, which he had taken with the tongs\nfrom the altar; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 And he made it touch my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath\ntouched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin\natoned for. \n 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I\nsend, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I, send\nme. \n 9 And. he-said, Go, and say to this people, Certainly hear ye,\nbut understand not; and see ye, but perceive not. \n 10 Make the heart of this people fat, and makeitheir ears\nheavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes,\nand hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and\nturn again, and one heal them. \n 11 And I said, Until when, Lord? And he said, Until the cities\nbe wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and\nthe land be utterly desolate, \n 12 And the LORD removed men far away, and great be\nthe forsaken (tract) in the midst of the land. \n 13 And still in it (there is) a tenth, and it shall turn again, and\nbe for consuming: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock is\nin them when they are felled: a holy seed is the stock thereof. \n VII. I And it came to pass the days of Ahaz the son of\nJotham, the son of Uaziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of\nAram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up\ntoward Jerusalem to war against it, but succeeded not in warring\nagainst it. \n 2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Aram rested \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 And he touched my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched\nthy lips, and shall take away thy transgressions, and shall purify\nthy sins. \n 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom am I to\nserial, and who will go to this people? And I said, Here am I;\nsen me. \n 9 And he said, Go, and say to this people, By hearing ye shall\nbear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not\nperceive. \n 10 For the heart of this people. is made fat, and with their\nears they hear dully, and their eyes have they closed; lest at any\ntime they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and\npgidrirstand with their heart, and should return, when I will heal\nthem. \n 11. And I said, Until when, Lord P And he said, Until cities be\ndesolated, because they are not inhabited, and houses, because\nthere are no men; and the land shall be left desolate. \n 12 And after this, God shall far remove men, and they that\nare left shall be multiplied upon the earth. \n 13 And still upon it is the tenth part, and again it shall be for\nplunder; as a terebinth, and as an oak, when it is torn from its\nplace. \n VII. 1 And it came to pass, in the days of Ahaz the son of\nJotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, there went up Rezin\nthe king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel,\nagainst Jerusalem to war against it, and they were not able to\nbesiege it. \n 2 And it was reported to the house of David, saying, Aram\n \n \n \n \n\n \nupon Ephraim. And his heart was shaken, and the heart of his\npeople, as the trees of the wood are shaken with the wind. \n 3 And the LORD said unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,\nthou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the\nupper pool in the highway of the fuller's \ufb01eld; \n 4 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not,\nneither be faint-hearted for these two tails of smoking firebrands.\nfor the fierce anger of Rezin with Aram, and of the son of\nRemaliah. \n 5 Because Aram hath taken evil counsel against thee, Ephraim\nand the son of Remaliah, saying, \n 6 Let us go up against Judah, and terrify it, and let us take it\nby storm for ourselves, and set up a king in the midst of it, even\n\u2019 the son of Tabeal: \n 7 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it\ncome to pass. \n 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of\nDamascus is Rezin; and within threescore and \ufb01ve years Vshall\nEphraim be broken, that it be not a people. \n 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the-head of\nSamaria is \u2019s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall\nnot be established. \n 10 And the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, \n 11 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God: ask, going deep or\nmounting high. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n hath made agreement with Ephraim; and his soul was distraught,\nand the soul of his people, like as when a tree in a forest is shaken\nwith the wind. \n 3 And the Lord said unto Isaiah, Go forth to meet Ahaz, thou,\nand he that is left, Jashub thy son, at the pool of the upper road\nof the fuller's \ufb01eld; \n 4 And thou shalt say to him, Take heed, that thou be quiet\nand fear thou not, neither let thy soul be faint, at these two logs\nof smoking firehrands; for when the anger of my wrath is come,\nI will heal again. \n 5 And (as for) the son of Aram and the son of Remaliah,\nbecause they have counselled evil counsel concerning thee, saying,\n\u1f22 6 We will go up against Judah, and let us talk with them, and\nturn them away to us, and we will make king over them the son\nof Tabeal: \n 7 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, This counsel shall not abide,\nneither shall it be. \n 8 But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of\nDamascus is Rezin; but yet within threescore and \ufb01ve years shall\nthe kingdom of Ephraim fail from (being) a people. \n 9 And the head of Ephraim is. Samaria, and the head of\nSamaria is \u2019s son: and if ye trust not, neither shall ye\nunderstand. \n 10 And the Lord spake unto Ahaz, saying,\nrr Ask thee a sign from the Lord thy God, (down) to the\ndepth or (up) to the height. \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the\nLORD. \n 13 And he said, Hear ye now, house of David; is its too\nlittle for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? \n 14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,\nthe is with child, and beareth a son, and shall call his name\nImmanuel. \n 15 Butter and honey shall he eat, as he leameth to refuse the\nevil, and choose the good. \n 16 For before the child learn to refuse the evil, and choose the\ngood, the land shall be forsaken, whose two kings thou fearest. \n 17 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people,\nand upon thy \u2019s house, days that have not come, from the\nday that Ephraim departed from Judah; the king of Assyria. \n 18 And it shall be in that. day, that the LORD shall hiss to the\n\ufb02y that is at the end of the rivers of Egypt, and to the bee that is\nin the land of Assyria. \n 19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the\nprecipitous valleys, and in the crevices of the rocks, and upon all\nthorn bushes, and upon all pastures. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the\nLord. \n 13 And he said, Hear ye now, house of David; is it a small\nthing for you to provoke men, and how are ye provoking the\nLord? \n 14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,\nthe virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and\nthou shalt call his name Immanuel. \n 15 Butter and honey shall he eat; before he learn to prefer\nevil, he shall choose out what is good: \n 16 For before the child learn good or bad, (he resisteth wickedness\nto choose out what is good,) the land which thou fearest\nshall be abandoned from before them. \n 17 But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and\nupon thy \u2019s house, days that have not yet come since the\nday when he tdok away Ephraim from Judah; the king of the\nAssyrians. \n 18 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall hiss to the \ufb02ies,\nthat which \u2019 over a part of the river of Egypt, and to the bee\nwhich is in the land of the Assyrians. \n 19 And they shall all come, and shall rest in the valleys of the\nland, and in the holes of the rocks, and into the caverns, and into\nevery cleft, and upon every tree. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 20 In that day shall the LORD shave with the razor that is hired,\n(which is) beyond the river, the king of Assyria; the head, and.\nthe hair of the feet, and the beard also shall it sweep away. \n 21 And it shall be in that day, that a man shall nourish a\nheifer of kine, and two sheep; \n 22 And it sheu be, from the abundance of milk they give, he\nshall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat, that is \u2019\nleft in the land. \n 23 And it shall be, in that day, that every place shall be, where\nthere were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall be\nI for briers and thorns. \n 24 With arrows and with bows shall one come thither; because\nall the land shall become briers and thorns. \n 25 And all the hills thatwere hoed with the hoe, thou shalt\nnot come hither for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for\nthe sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep. \n VIII. 1 And the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great\n\u2019 and write upon it with a \u2019s pen, For Maher-shalal-\nhash-baz. \n 2 And I will take unto me faithful witnesses to witness, Uriah\nthe priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. \n 3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and\nbare a son. Then said the LORD unto me, Call his name\nMaher-shalal-hash-baz. \n \n \n\n \n 20 In that day shall theLord shave with the razor that is great\nand drunken, which is beyond the river of the king of the\nAssyrians; the head, and the hair of the feet, and the beard\nshall he take away. \n 21 And it shall be in that day, a man shall nourish a heifer of\nkine, and two sheep: \n 22 And it shall be, from their giving very much milk, butter\nand honey shall everyone eat, that is left upon the land. \n 23 And it shall be, in that day, every place, wheresoever there\nbe a thousand vines at a thousand Shekels, they shall be for barren\nland and thorn. \n 24 With arrow and bow shall they enter there; for barren and\nthorn shall all the land be; \n 25 And every mountain shall be deeply ploughed; and fear\nshall not come thither; for from the barren land and thorn it shall\nbe for the feeding of a sheep, and the treading of an ox. \n VIII. I And the Lord said unto me, Take thee a leaf of\na new great sheet and write upon it with a \u2019s pen, (For)\nto make speedily a plundering of spoils; for it is at hand. \n 2 And make faithful men my witnesses, Uriah, and Zechariah,\nthe son of Berechiah. \n 3 And he went in unto the prophetess; and she conceived,\nand bare a son. And the Lord said to me, Call his name\nQuickly spoil, speedily plunder: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,\nand, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of\nSamaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria. \n 5 And the LORD spake also unto me again, saying, \n 6 Forasmuch as this people hath rejected the waters of\nShiloah that go softly, and rejoice with Rezin and \u2019s\nson: \n 7 Now therefore, behold, the LORD bringeth up upon them\nthe waters of the river, strong and many, the king of Assyria,\nand all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels,\nand go over all his banks: \n 8 And he shall sweep on into Judah; he shall overflow and\npass through; to the neck shall he reach, and the stretching out\nof his wings shall \ufb01ll the breadth of thy land, Immanuel. \n 9 Rage, ye peoples, and be broken; and give ear, all distant\nparts of the earth; gird yourselves, and be broken! gird yourselves,\nand be broken! \n 10 Take counsel, and it shall come to nought; speak a word,\nand it shall not stand; for God is with us. \n 11 For the LORD spake thus to me with strength. of hand,\nand instructed me not to walk in the way of this people,\nsaying, \n 12 Say ye not, A conspiracy, of all whereof this people saith,\nA conspiracy 3 and fear not the fear of it, nor be afraid: \n 13 The LORD of Hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be\nyour fear, and let him be your dread. \n \n\n \n 4 For before the child learn to call father or mother, (one)\nshall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria\nbefore the king of the Assyrians. \n 5 And the Lord spake further unto me yet, \n 6 Because this people desire not the water of Siloam which\ngoeth quietly, but desire to have \u2019n and the son of Remaliah\nfor king over you: \n 7 Therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon you the \u2019s\nwater, that is strong and mighty, the king of the Assyrians and\nhis glory; and he shall go up upon every valley of yours, and\nwalk about upon every wall of yours. \n 8 And he shall take away from Judah (any) man who shall\nbe able to raise the head, if it be possible to accomplish aught:\nand his camp shall be #x003C;so as to fill> the Wide spaces of thy\nGod (is) with us. \n 9. Learn, ye nations, and be overcome: ye shall hearken, unto\nthe end of the earth; when ye are waxed strong, be overcome;\nI or if ye wax strong again, ye shall be overcome again. \n 10 And whatsoever counsel ye take, the Lord shall scatter it:\nand whatsoever word ye speak, it shall not abide for you; for\nthe LOrd God is with us. \n 11 Thus saith the Lord God, With the strong hand do they\ndispute the passage of the way of this people, saying, \n 12 Never speak ye stubbornly; for all that this people\nspeaketh is stubborn; but fear ye not the fear of it, nor be\nconfounded: \n 13 Sanctify the Lord himself; and he himself shall be your Fear. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of\nstumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel,\nfor a and for. a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. \n 15 And many shall stumble upon them, and fall, and be\nbroken, and be snared, and be taken. \n 16 Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my\ndisciples. \n 17 And I will wait for the LORD, that hideth his face from\nthe house of Jacob; and will hope in him. \n 18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given\nme are for signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of Hosts,\nwhich dwelleth in mount Zion. \n 19 And when they shall say unto you, Inquire of the necromancers\nand the wizards, that peep and that mutter; should not\na people inquire of its God? (should they inquire) of the dead\non behalf of the living? \n 20 To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according\nto this word, surely there is no dawn for him. \n 21 And he shall pass through it, hardly arid hungry;\nand it shall be, when he shall be hungry, he shall fret himself,\nand revile his king and his God, and shall face upward: \n \n\n \n 14 And if thou hast trusted \u2019in him, he shall be for a sanctuary\nto thee; and ye shall not come upon him as a stumbling block\nof a stone, nor as an offence of a rock. But the house of Jacob\n(is) in a snare, and men that sit in Jerusalem in a hollow. \n 15 Therefore shall many among them be powerless, and shall\nfall, and shall be crushed; and men that are in safety shall\ndraw near, and shall be taken. \n 16 Then shall they be manifest, who seal up the law, that\nthey should learn. \n 17 And he shall say, I will wait for God, that hath turned his\nface from the house of Jacob, and will have my trust in him. \n 18 Behold me, and the children which God hath given me.\nAnd they shall be for signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord\nof Hosts, who dwelleth in the mount Zion. \n 19 And if they say unto you, Seek ye them that speak from\nthe earth, and the ventriloquists, the babblers that talk from the\nbelly: is it not a nation with its God? Why are they to seek\nout the dead concerning the living? \n 20 For he hath given them a law for their help: that they\nmay speak not as this word, concerning which there is no giving\nof gifts. \n 21 And there shall come upon you cruel famine; and it\nshall be, when ye hunger, ye shall be grieved, and shall revile\nyour ruler, and your country's (laws); and they shall look up\nto the heaven above, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 22 And he shall look unto the earth; and behold, trouble\nand darkness, dimness of anguish; and into gloom is be driven\naway. \n IX. I Yet there is no darkness to her that had distress.\nAs at the \ufb01rst he brought into contempt the land of Zabulon\nand the land of Naphthali, so in the\u2018latter time he (hath)\nbrought honour to the way of the sea, beyond\u2014 Jordan, Galilee\nof the nations. \n 2 The people that walk in darkness have seen a great light:\nthey that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them\n\u2019 \u0387 hath the light shined. \n 3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased its\njoyz\u2019 they joy before thee like the joy in harvest, and as men\nexult when they divide the spoil. \n 4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the sta\ufb02\u2019\nof his shoulder, the rod of his exactor, as in the day of Midian. \n 5 For every boot of him that is booted with tumult, and the\ncloke rolled in blood\u2014it shall be for burning, for fuel of \ufb01re. \n 6 For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and\nthe government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called\nWonder, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince\nof Peace. \u2019 \n \n \n \n\n \n 22 And shall look unto the earth beneath; and behold,\naffiction and straitening and darkness, strait dismay and darkness\nthat they see not. \n And he that is in straitness shall not be dismayed until a season. \n IX. I Drink this \ufb01rst, do it quickly, country of Zabulon,\nland of Naphthali, by the way of the sea, and the rest that\ndwell by the sea shore and across Jordan, Galilee of the nations,\nthe parts of Judah. \n 2 people that sittest in darkness, see ye a great light; ye\nthat dwell in the land and in the shadow of death, a light shall\nshine upon you. \n 3 The most part of the people, which thou broughtest back\nin thy joy, shall even joy before thee as they that joy in harvest,\nand like as they joy that divide spoils. \n 4 For the yoke that lay upon them shall be taken away, and\nthe rod that was upon their neck; for the Lord hath scattered in\npieces the rod of the exactors, as in the day that was upon Midian. \n 5 For every garment collected with guile, and cloke with\nreconciling shall they repay, and they shall be willing, if they\nhad been burnt with \ufb01re. \n 6 For a child is born unto us, a son also is given unto us,\nupon whose shoulder was the government; and he shall call\nhis name Messenger of great counsel [Wonderful Counsellor,\nMighty, Powerful, Prince of Peace, Father of the Age to come]:\nfor I will bring peace upon the rulers, peace and health to him. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 To the increase of his government and to peace there is\nno end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to\nestablish it and to sustain it with judgment and with righteous-\nness from henceforth and for ever. The jealousy of the LORD\nof Hosts will do this. \n 8 The LORD sent a word into Jacob, and it shall fall upon\nIsrael. \n 9 And the whole people, they shall know, Ephraim and the\ninhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and stoutness of heart, \n 10 Bricks are fallen, and we will build with hewn stones;\nsycamores are cut down, and we will change (them) forcedars. \n 11 Therefore the LORD hath set up the adversaries of Rezin\nagainst him, and stirred up his enemies; \n 12 Aram before, and the Philistines behind: and they devoUr\nIsraelwith open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned\naway, but his hand is stretched out still. \n 13 And the people hath not turned unto him that smiteth\nthem, neither have they sought the LORD of hosts. \n 14 And the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm\nbranch and rush, in one day. \n 15 The elder and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet\nthat teacheth lies, he is the tail. \n 16 And the leaders of this people cause them to err; and those\nof them that are led are swallowed up. \n 17 Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over its young men,\nneither shall have mercy on its fatherless and widows; for every\none thereof is impious and an evil doer, and every mouth\nspeaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but\nhis hand is stretched out still. \n \n \n\n \n 7 Great is his rule, and of his peace there is no limit, upon\nthe throne of David, and his kingdom, to order it and to take\nhold upon it in righteousness and in judgment from henceforth\nand for ever; the jealousy of the Lord of hosts will do this. \n 8 The Lord sent death upon Jacob, and it came upon Israel. \n 9 And they shall learn, all the people of Ephraim and they\nthat sit in Samaria, saying, in pride and uplifted heart, \n 10 The bricks are fallen, but come, let us hew stones; and\nlet us cut down sycamines and cedars, and build ourselves a tower. \n 11 And God will smite them that rise up against mount Zion\nagainst them, and will. scatter their enemies, \n 12 Syria from the sunrising, and the Greeks from the sunsetting;\nthem that devour Israel with open mouth. For all this\nhis wrath is not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. \n 13 And the people turned not back until it was smitten, and\nthey sought not out the Lord. \n 14 And the Lord hath taken away from Israel head and tail,\ngreat and small, in one day; an elder, and respecters of persons;\nthis is the beginning, \n 15 And a prophet that teacheth transgressions; he is the tail. \n 16 And they that call this people happy shall be causing them\nto err, and they cause them to err, that they may swallow them up. \n 17 Therefore God shall not rejoice over the young men, and\non their fatherless and widows shall he not have mercy; for\nthey are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth \u2019peaketh\nunjustly. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his\nhand is still upraised. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 For wickedness burned as a \ufb01re: briers and thorns it\ndevoured, and it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they\nwere. whirled upward with a lifting-up of smoke. \n 19 With the wrath of the LORD of Hosts is the land turned\nblack, and the people are become as food for \ufb01re; they spared\nnot a man his brother. \n 20 And one snatched on the right hand, and was hungry; and\nate on the left hand, and they were not satisfied: every man the\n\ufb02esh of his arm did they eat: \n 21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Mahasseh: they\ntogether against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned\naway, but his hand is stretched out still. \n X. 1 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and\nto scribes that prescribe oppression: \n 2 To turn aside the weak from judgment, and to strip the\nright from the poor of I my people, that widows may be their\nspoil, and that they may prey on orphans. \n 3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the\nruin that cometh from far? to whom will ye \ufb02ee for help? and\nwhere will ye leave your glory? \n 4 (Nought remains), but to crouch under the prisoners, and\nfall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away,\nbut his hand is stretched out still. \n 5 Ah, Asshur, the rod of mine anger, and a staff is it in.\ntheir hand, mine indignation. \n 6 I will send him against an impious nation, and against the\npeople of my wrath will I give him a charge, to spoil the spoil\nand to prey on the prey, and to make them a treading down\nlike the mire of the streets. \n \n \n\n \n 18 And their. transgression shall burn as a \ufb01re, and shall be\ndevoured by \ufb01re like dry grass; and it shall burn in the thickets\nof the forest, and shall eat up all that is round about the bills: \n 19 Because of the wrath of the anger of the Lord shall the\nwhole land be burned up, and the people shall be as though\nutterly burned by \ufb01re. A man shall not pity his brother, \n 20 But he shall turn aside to the right, because he shall be\nhungry, and shall eat from the left, and shall not be satisfied:\neating (every) man the \ufb02esh of his [brother's] arm. \n 21 For Manasseh shall eat of Ephraim, and Ephraim of\nManasseh; for together shall they besiege Judah. For all this\nhis wrath is not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. \n X. r Woe to them that write wickedness; for they write,\nand write wickedness, \n 2 Perverting the cause of beggars, and robbing the poor\namong my people of their judgment, so that the widow serveth\nthem for spoil, and the fatherless for plunder. \n 3 And what will they do in the day of their visitation? for\nthe affliction come on you from far; and to whom will ye\n\ufb02ee for help? and where will ye leave your glory, \n 4 That it fall not into captivity? And they shall fall under\nthe slain. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his\nhand is still upraised. \n 5 Ah, for the Assyrians; the rod of my wrath and of anger\n(is) in their hands. \n 6 I dorsend mine anger against a transgressing nation, and to\nmy. people will I give a charge to take spoils and plunder, and\nto tread down the cities and turn them to a dust cloud. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 And he, he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think\nso; but it is in his heart to work destruction, and to cut off\nnations not a few. \n 8 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? \n 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish, or Hamath as Arpad, or\nSamaria as Damascus? \n 10 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the false\u2014\nand their images were more than Jerusalem and\u2014\nrr Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her false gods,\nso do to Jerusalem and her offences? \n 12 And it shall be, when the Lord hath \ufb01nished his whole\nwork upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will visit upon the\nfruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glorying\nof his loftiness of eyes. \n 13 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it,\nand by my wisdom, for I (can) discern: and I have removed the\nbounds of peoples, and robbed their treasures, and brought down,\nlike a mighty one, them that \u2019enthroned: \n 14 And my hand hath reached, as a nest, the riches of\nthe peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have\nI gathered all the earth; and there. was none that \ufb02uttered\na wing, or opened a mouth, or peeped. \n 15 Shall the axe glory against him that heweth therewith?\nShall the saw magnify itself against him that plieth it? as if\na rod should ply them that lift it up, as if a staff should lift\nup what is not wood. \n 16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, send among\nhis fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall burn a\nburning like the burning of \ufb01re. \n 17 And the light of Israel shall be for a \ufb01re, and his Holy\nOne for a \ufb02ame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and\nhis briers in one day; \n \n\n \n 7 But he himself thought not thus, and not thus hath he\nconsidered in his heart; but his mind shall change, even to\ndestroy nations not a few. \n 8 And if they say unto him, Thou alone art ruler, \n 9 Then shall he say, Did I not take the country above\nBabylon, and Calno, where the tower was built? and I took\nArabia, and Damascus, and Samaria: \n 10 Like as I took these in my hand, I will also take all the\n- countries. Wail, ye graven images in Jerusalem and in Samaria: \n 11 For like as I did to Samaria and the works of her hands,\nso also will I do to Jerusalem and her idols. \n 12 And it shall be, when the Lord hath made an end of doing\nall things in the mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he shall turn (his\nhand) against the mighty mind, against the ruler of the Assyrians,\nand upon the uplifting of the glory of his eyes. \n 13 For he said, By my strength will I do it, and <by\nwisdom of my prudence> will I remove the boundaries of\nand will plunder their strength. \n 14 And I will Shake inhabited cities, and the whole world will\nI seize with my hand like a nest, and like eggs that are left will\nI take them up; and there is none that shall escape me, or can\ngainsay me. \n 15 Shall an axe be glorified, apart from him that smiteth with\nit? or shall a saw be uplifted, apart from him that driveth it?\nas if one should lift a rod or staff, and not thus? \n 16 But the Lord of Hosts shall send dishonour upon thine\nhonour, and burning \ufb01re shall burn against thy glory. \n 17 And-the light of Israel shall be as a \ufb01re, and he shall\nsanctify it in burning \ufb01re, and shall devour the wood as grass, \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his\ngarden-land, from soul and even to. \ufb02esh; and it shall be as\nwhen a sick \u2019man pinetb away. \n 19 And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,\nand a child may write them. \n 20 And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and\nsuch as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again\nlean upon him that smote them; but shall lean upon the Lord,\nthe Holy One of Israel, in truth. \n 21 The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, unto the\nMighty God. \n 22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,\na remnant (only) of it shall return; destruction is decided,\nover\ufb02owing in righteousness. \n 23 For a destruction and a decision shall the Lord GOD of\nHosts make, in the midst of all the earth. \n 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Hosts, Be not afraid,\nmy people that dwellest in Zion, of Asshur; though he smite\nthee with a rod, and lift up his staff against thee, in the way\nof Egypt. \n 25 For yet a very little while, and indignation shall be at an\nend, and mine anger shall be to their destruction. \n 26 And the LORD of Hosts shall stir up a scourge against him\nlike the smiting of Midian at the rock Oreb ; and his rod is upon\nthe sea, and he lifteth it up, in the way of Egypt. \n 27 And it shall be in that day, his burden shall remove from\noff thy shoulder, and his yoke from of? thy neck, and the yoke\nshall be destroyed by reason of fatness. \n 28 He is come upon Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at\nMichmash he layeth up his baggage; \n \n \n\n \n 18 In that day the mountains and the forests and the hills\nshall be blotted out, and he shall devour them from the soul\nto the \ufb02esh; and he that \ufb02eeth shall be as he that \ufb02eeth from\nburning \ufb02ame: \n 19 And they that are left from them shall be few, and a little\nchild shall write them. \n 20 And it shall be in that day, no longer shall the remnant\nof Israel be added, and they that are saved of Jacob shall no\nmore put their trust in them that did them wrong, but they shall\nput their trust in God, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.\n2; And the remnant of Jacob shall be toward the mighty God. \n 22 And if the people of Israel become as the sand of the\nsea, the remnant shall be saved; for (he is) fulfilling a word\nand cutting it short in righteousness, \n 23 Because God shall perform a word (that is) cut short, in\nthe whole world. \n 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Fear not, my\npeople, ye that dwell in Zion, because of the Assyrians; for\nwith a rod shall he smite thee; for I bring a stroke upon thee,\nthat thou mayest see the way of Egypt. \n 25 For yet a little, and the anger shall cease; but my wrath is\nagainst their counsel. \n 26 And God shall stir (a stroke) against them, according\nto the stroke of Midian, in a place of affliction; and his wrath\n(shall be) at the way by the sea, toward the way by Egypt. \n 27 And it shall be in that day, the fear of him shall be taken\naway from thee, and his yoke from 03 thy shoulder, and his yoke\nshall be destroyed from off your shoulders. \n 28 For he shall come to the city of Aiath, \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 29 They pass through the pass: in Geba they make their\nlodging; Ramah trembleth: Gibeah of Saul \ufb02eeth. \n 30 Cry out with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: listen,\nLaishah; O thou poor Anathoth! \n 31 Madmenah wandereth away; the inhabitants of Gebim\ngather (their goods) to \ufb02ee. \n 32 Within this very day he halteth at Nob, waving his hand\n(at) the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. \n 33 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of Hosts, shall lop the leafy\nbough with terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn\ndown, and the haughty shall be humbled. \n 34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,\nand Lebanon shall fall by a majestic one. \n XI. 1 And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock\nof Jesse, and a Branch out of his roots shall bear fruit; \n 2 And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, a spirit of\nwisdom and discernment, a spirit of counsel and might, a spirit\nof knowledge and of the fear of the LORD: \n 3 And he shall breathe in the fear of l the LORD: and he shall\nnot judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the\nhearing of his ears: \n 4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide\nwith equity for \u2019 meek of the earth: and he shall smite the\nearth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breather his lips\nshall he slay the wicked. \n 5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of. his loins, and\nfaithfulness the girdle of his reins. \n \n \n \n\n \n 29 And shall pass over to Megiddo, and at Michmash shall\nhe set down his baggage; and he shall pass over a valley, and\nshall come to Aiath; fear shall seize on Ramah, the city of Saul. \n 30 The daughter of Gallim shall \ufb02ee: one shall hear at 83, I\nshall hear at Anathoth: \n 31 Madmenah shrank away, and the dwellers in Gebir. \n 32 Encourage her to day in the way to stay, encourage with\nthe hand the hill, the daughter of Zion, and ye hills that are in\nJerusalem. \n 33 For behold, the ruler, the Lord of Hosts, confoundeth the\nglorious ones with might, and they that are uplifted in insolence\nshall be crushed, and the uplifted ones shall be humbled \n 34 by the sword, and Lebanon with his uplifted ones shal\nfall. \n XI. 1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of\nJesse, and a blossom shall come up from his root. \n 2 And there shall rest upon him a spirit of God, a spirit of\nwisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and might, a\nspirit of knowledge and-of reverence; \n 3 A spirit of the fear of God shall \ufb01ll him; he shall not\njudge according to the seeming, nor convict according to report, \n 4 But he shall judge judgment for the humble, and shall\nconvict the humble ones of the earth, and shall smite the earth\nwith the word of his mouth, and with the breath through his\nlips shall he slay the impious man: \n 5 And he shall be girded with righteousness about his loins,\nand bound with truth about \u2019his sides. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard\nlie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and\nthe fatling together; and a little child their leader. \n 7 And the cow and the bear shall graze: their young ones\nshall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. \n 8 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,\nand the weaned child shall stretch his hand upon the \u2019s den. \n 9 They shall not do evil or deal corruptly in all my. holy\nmountain; for the earth shall be \ufb01lled with the knowledge of the\nLORD, as the waters cover the sea. \n 10 And it shall be in that day; the root of Jesse, which\nstandeth for an ensign of the peoples, of him shall the nations\ninquire: and his resting-place shall be glory. \n 11 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall set his hand\nagain the second time to purchase the remnant of his people\nwhich shall remain from ASsyria, and from Egypt, and from\nPathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and\nfrom llamath, and from the isles of the sea. \n 12 And he shalllift up an ensign for the nations, and shall\ngather the outcasts of Israel, and collect the dispersed of Judah\nfrom the four corners of the earth. \n 13 And the jealousy of Ephraim shall remove, and the adversaries\nof Judah shall be cut 06; Ephraim shall not be jealous\nof Judah, and Judah shall not be adverse to Ephraim. \n 14 And they shall light upon the shoulder of the Philistines\ntoward the west; they shall spoil the children of the east to-\ngether; Edom and Moab shall be the putting forth of their hand,\nand the children of Ammon their obedience. \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 And the wolf shall graze with the lamb, and the leopard\nshall rest with the kid, and the calf and the bull and the lion\nshall graze together, and a little child shall lead them. \n 7 And the ox and the bear shall graze together, and their\nyoung ones shall graze together, and they shall eat chaff together the lion and the ox. \n 8 And a young child shall lay his hand over the hole of asps,\nand on the lair of the offspring of asps. \n 9 And they shall not do evil, neither shall they be able to\ndestroy any upon my holy mountain; for the whole (earth) is\n\ufb01lled with the knowledge of the Lord, as much water covereth\nseas. \n 10 And in that day shall be the root of Jesse, and he that\nstandeth up to rule over nations; in him shall nations hope.\nAnd his rest shall be honour. \n 11 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall again show his\nhand to be jealous for the remnant which is left of the people,\nwhatever be left from the Assyrians, and from Egypt, and Babylonia,\nand Ethiopia, and from the Elamites, and from the rising\nup of the sun, and from Arabia. \n 12 And he shall lift up a signal toward the nations, and shall\nbring together them that are. perished of Israel, and them that\nare scattered of Judah shall he bring together from the four\ncorners of the earth. \n 13 And the yoke of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the\nenemies of Judah shall perish; Ephraim shall not envy Judah,\nand Judah shall not afflict Ephraim. \n 14 And they shall \ufb02y in \u2019 ships; they shall plunder\nthe sea together, and them from the rising of the sun, and Edom;\nand upon Moab \ufb01rst shall they lay their hands, and the children\nof Ammon shall be \ufb01rst to obey them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 And. the LORD shall lay under a ban the tongue of the\nEgyptian sea; and with the violence of his wind shall he wave\nhis hand over the river, and shall smite it into seven streams,\nand make men go over dryshod. \n 16 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his\npeople, which shall remain from Assyria; as there was for Israel\nin the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. \n XII. I And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will thank\nthee; for thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,\nand thou comfortedst me. \n 2 Behold, God my salvation: I will trust, and not be afraid;\nfor JAH the LORD is my strength and song; and he is become my\nsalvation. \n 3 And ye shall draw water with joy out of the wells of-\nsalvation. \n 4 And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks to the LORD,\nproclaim in his name, make known his deeds among the peoples,\nmake mention that his name is exalted. \n 5 Make music to the LORD, for he hath wrought excellence:\nlet this be known in all the earth. \n 6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitress of Zion; for great is\nthe Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. I\nXIII. r The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of\nAmoz did see. \n 2 Lift ye up an ensign upon a bare mountain; raise (the\nvoice) unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the\ngates of the nobles. \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 And the Lord shall make the sea of Egypt desolate, and\nshall lay his hand upon the river with a mighty wind, and shall\nsmite seven channels, so that he go over (dry) shod, \n 16 And there shall be a way for my people that are left in\nEgypt; and it shall be to Israel as the day when he came out of\nthe land of Egypt. \n XII. I And thou shalt in that day, I will praise thee,\n\u039f Lord, because thou wast angry with me, and didst turn away\nthy wrath, and pitiedst me. \n 2 Behold, my God is my Saviour, I will trust in him, and\nwill not be afraid; for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and\nhe is become my salvation. \n 3 And ye shall draw water with joy out of the fountains of\nsalvation. \n 4 And thou shalt say in that day, Praise the Lord, cry his\nname aloud, proclaim his glorious deeds among the nations;\nmake mention that his name is exalted. \n 5 Praise the name of the Lord, for he hath done exalted\ndeeds; proclaim this in all the earth. \n 6 Exult and rejoice, ye that dwell in Zion: for the Holy One\nof Israel is exalted in the midst of thee. \n XIII. I Vision which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw against\nBab lon. \n 2 Lift ye up a signal on a mountain in a plain, upraise your\nvoice to them, be] not afraid: encourage (them) in heart: open,\nye rulers. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 I, I have charged my consecrated ones, \u2019have also called\nmy mighty ones for mine anger, that exult in my excellence. \n 4 The voice of an uproar, like as of a great people; the voice\nof a tumult of the kingdoms of nations gathered together; the\nLORD of Hosts mustereth a host of war. \n 5 They come from a far country, from the end of the heavens;\nthe LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the\nwhole earth. \n 6 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD \u2019is at hand; it shall come\nas a destruction from the Almighty. \n 7 Therefore shall all hands be slack, and every \u2019s heart\nshall melt, \n 8 And they shall be dismayed: pangs and sorrows shall take\nhold of them; they shall writhe as a travailing woman; they shall\nlook aghast one at another: faces of \ufb02ame are their faces. \n 9 Behold, the \u2019day of the LORD cometh, cruel, and wrath and\n\ufb01erce anger, to make the earth a desolation, and he will destroy\nthe sinners thereof out of it. \n 10 For the stars of heaven, and the Orions thereof, shall not\ngive forth their light; the sun shall be dark at his going forth, and\nthe moon shall not cause her light to shine. \n 11 And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for\ntheir iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to\ncease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. \n 12 I will make a man more precious than \ufb01ne gold, and man-\nkind than the (pure) gold of. Ophir. \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 \u0399 marshal them, even I; they are sanctified, and I lead\nthem; giants come to fulfil my wrath, rejoicing and proud\ntogether. \n 4 \u0391 voice of many nations upon the mountains, like (the\nvoice) of many nations; a voice of kings and of nations gathered\ntogether. The Lord of Hosts hath commanded an armed nation \n 5 To come from aland afar off, from the uttermost foundation\nof heaven, the Lord and his armed men, to destroy the whole\nworld. \n 6 Wail ye: \u2019the day of the Lord is near; and a destruction\nshall come from God. \n 7 Therefore shall every hand he slackened, and every heart\nof man shall be faint: \n 8 And the old men shall be confounded, and pangs as of a\ntravailing woman shall have hold of them; and they shall lament\none with another, and shall be amazed, and shall change their\nface as doth a \ufb02ame. \n 9 For behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and there is no\nhealing of its wrath and anger, to make the earth desolate, and to,\ndestroy the sinners out of it. \n 10 For the stars of heaven, and Orion, and all the order of\n\u2019 heaven shall not give their light; and it shall grow dark when\nthe sun ariseth, and the mobn shall not give her light. \n 11 And I will command evils upon the whole world, even\ntheir own sins upon the wicked: and I will destroy the pride of\ntransgressors, and will humble the pride of the arrogant; \n 12 And they that are left shall be more precious than new gold;\nand the man shall be more precious than the stone from Ophir. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 Therefore will make the heavens tremble, and the earth\nshall be disquieted from her place, at the wrath of the LORD of\nHosts, and in the day of the heat of his anger. \n 14 And it shall be as (with) a chased roe; and as sheep, and\nthere is none that gathereth; they shall every man turn to his\nown people, and \ufb02ee everyone to his own land. \n 15. Everyone that is found shall be thrust through, and every-\none that is taken shall fall by the sword. \n 16 And their infants shall be dashed to pieces before their\neyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. \n 17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall\nnot regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. \n 18 And bows shall dash youths in pieces; and they shall have\nno pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not have mercy\non children. \n 19 And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the\npride of the Chaldees, shall be as \u2019s overthrow of Sodom\nand Gomorrah. \n 20 It shall not inhabited for ever, neither shall it be dwelt\nin from generation to generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch\ntent there, neither shall shepherds make (flocks) to lie down\ndwarf. But desert creatures shall lie there; and their houses shall\ngroaners \ufb01ll; and ostriches shall dwell there; and shaggy beasts\nshall dance there. \n 22 And wolves shall howl in their castles, and jackals in\npalaces \u2019of pleasure; and her time is near to come, and her\ndays shall not be prolonged. \n XIV. r For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and\nwill yet (again) choose Israel, and set them on their own ground:\nand the stranger shall join himself unto them, and they shall\ncleave to the house of Jacob. \n \n\n \n 13 For the heaven shall be wroth, and the earth shall be\nshaken from her foundations, because of the wrath of the anger\nof the Lord of Hosts, in the day when his wrath cometh upon it. \n 14 And they that are left shall be as a roe that \ufb02eeth, and as\na sheep that wandereth, and there shall be none that gathereth\nthem together, for each to return to his people; and each to haste\ninto his own land. \n 15 For whosoever is taken shall be overcome, and whosoever\nare gathered together shall fall by the sword. \n 16 And they Shall dash their children down before their face,\nand plunder their houses, and take possession of their wives. \n 17 Behold, I rouse up against you the Medes, who reckon\nnot silver, neither have they any need of gold. \n 18 They shall shatter the bows of the young men; and they\nshall not have pity on your children, nor shall their eyes spare\nyour children. \n 19 And Babylon, which is called honourable by the king\nof the Chaldeans, shall be, like as God overthrew Sodom and\nGomorrah. \n 20 It shall not be inhabited for ever, nor shall they enter \u2019\nit throughout many generations, nor shall the Arabians pass through\nit, nor shall shepherds rest therein. \n 21 And wild beasts shall rest there, and houses shall be \ufb01lled\nwith noise: and owls shall rest there, and demons shall dance\nthere. \n 22 And apes shall dwell there, and hedgehogs shall make their\nnests in their houses. Quickly it comes, and will not linger. \n xrv. 1 And the Lord shall have pity on Jacob, and will\nyet choose out Israel, and they shall rest upon their own land;\nand the stranger shall be added unto them, and shall be added\nunto the house of Jacob. \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place\nand the house of Israel shall take them as their possession upon\nthe \u2019s ground for servants and for handmaids; and they\nshall be captors to their captors 3 and they shall rule over their\noppressors. \n 3 And it shall be in that day that the LORD giveth thee rest\nfrom thy pain and thy disquiet, and from the hard bondage which\nwas laid upon thee, \n 4 That thou shalt take up this \u2019parable over the king Of\nBabylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased, the insolence\nceased! \n 5 The LORD hath broken the staff of the the rod of\nrulers, \n 6 Which smote peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, ruled\nover nations in anger with a pursuit that none restrained. \n 7 The whole earth is at rest, is quiet; they break forth into\nSinging. \n 8 Yea, the \ufb01r trees rejoice at thee, the cedars of Lebanon,\n(saying,) Since thou hast lain down, the feller cometh not up\nagainst us. \n 9 Hell (from) beneath is disquieted for thee, to meet thee at\nthy coming; it stirreth up the Shades for thee, all the chief ones\nof the earth; \u2019 raiseth from their thrones all the kings of the\nnations. \n 10 All they shall answer and say \u2019unto thee, Thou also art\nmade weak as we \u1f26 thou art made like unto us! \n 11 Thy pride is brought down to hell, the noise of thy viols;\nthe maggot is spread under thee, and the worm is thy covering. \n \n\n \n 2 And nations shall take them, and-bring them into their\nplace; and they shall make them to inherit it, and shall be\nmultiplied upon the land of God for bondmen and for bondwomen;\nand they that did carry them into captivity shall be\ncaptives, and they that were lords over them shall have them for\nlords. \n 3 And it shall be in that day, God shall make thee to rest\nfrom thy woe, and from thine indignation, and from thy hard\nbondage with which thou servedst them. \n 4 And \u2019 shalt take up this lament upon the king of\nBabylon, and say in that day, \u2019has the exactor ceased, and\nthe oppressor ceased! \n 5 God hath broken in pieces the yoke of the sinners, the yoke\nof the rulers, \n 6 Smiting a nation in wrath, with a stroke that cannot be\nhealed; striking a nation a wrathful blow which \u2019spareth not, he\nhath rested in confidence. \n 7 All the earth shouteth with joy, \n 8 And the trees of Lebanon rejoice over thee, and the cedar\nof Lebanon, (saying,) Since thou hast lain down to sleep, there\nhath not come up one that felleth us. \n 9 Hell from beneath is embittered on meeting thee; there\nwere roused up together for thee all the giants that did rule the\nearth, that roused from their thrones all kings of the nations; \n 10 All shall answer and say to thee, Thou also art taken, as\nwe also were; and art reckoned among us. \n 11 But down to hell hath thy glory come, thy plentiful joy;\nunder thee shall they spread decay, and a worm is thy covering. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 How art thou fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of the\ndawn; how art thou hewn down to the ground, which didst lay\nlow the nations! \n 13 And thou, thou sajdst in thy heart, I will ascend the\nheavens; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I\nwill sit upon the mount of assembly, in the recesses of the north: \n 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will\nmake myself like the most High. \n 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the recesses of\nthe pit. \n 16 They that see thee shall look narrowly on thee, shall gaze\nearnestly on thee: Is this the man that did disquiet the earth,\nthat made kingdoms tremble? \n 17 (That) made the world as a wilderness, and broke down the\ncities thereof; that loosed not his prisoners homeward\n18 All \u2019s of nations, all of them, have lain down in glory,\neach in his house. \n 19 But thou art cast out away from thy sepulchre like a\nrejected branch, clothed with the slain, that are thrust through\nwith the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, like a\ntrampled carcase. \n 20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou\n\u2019destroyed thy land, slain thy people: the seed of evil doers\nshall not be named, for ever. \n 21 Prepare for his sons (a place of) slaughter, for the iniquity\nof their fathers; that they rise not up, and possess the earth, nor\n\ufb01ll the face of the world with cities. \n 22 And I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of Hosts,\nand cut off from Babylon name, and remnant, and issue, and\noffspring: saith the LORD. \n 23 And I will make it a possession for the bittern, and pools\nof water; and I will sweep it away with the besom of destruction,\n\u2019the LORD of Hosts. \n \n \n\n \n 12 How is Lucifer, that riseth early, fallen out of heaven!\nhe is crushed into the earth, that sent forth unto all the nations. \n 13 But thou saidst in thy heart, Up to heaven \u2018will I go, above\nthe stars of heaven will I set my throne; I will sit on a high\nmountain, above the high\u2019hills toward the north, \n 14 I will go up above the clouds, I will be like the most High. \n 15 But now shalt thou go down\u2019into hell, and into the foundations\nof the earth. \n 16 They that see thee shall marvel at thee, and say, This is\nthe man that tortureth the earth, shaking kings, \n 17 He that maketh the whole world desolate, <and his cities\nhath he destroyed,> those in (his) train hath he not loosed; \n 18 All the kings of the nations have lain down to rest in\nhonour, each one in his own house: \n 19 But thou shalt be cast forth upon the mountains, like a\nloathed corpse; with many dead, that are thrust through with\nswords, that go down to Hell. Even as a cloke smeared with\nblood shall not be clean, \n 20 Even so\u2018neither shalt thou be clean, because thou didst\"\ndestroy my land, and didst slay my peOple; thou shalt not abide,\nno, not for ever, an evil seed. \n 21 Make ready thy children to be slaughtered for the sins of:\nthy father} that they may not rise up, and inherit the earth, and .\n\ufb01ll the earth with wars. \n 22 And I will rise against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and \u0391\nwill destroy their name, and remnant, and seed: thus saith the\nLord. \n 23 And I will make Babylon desolate, for hedgehogs to dwell\n\u2019 there; and it shall come to nought; and I will make it a <pit>\nof mire, unto destruction. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 24 The LORD of Hosts hath- Sworn, saying, Surely as I have\nplanned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, that shall stand: \n 25 To break Asshur in my land, and on my mountains I will\ntrample him; and his yoke shall remove from off them, and his\nburden shall remove from off his shoulder. \n 26 This is the purpose which is purposed upon the whole\nearth; and this the hand that is stretched out upon all the\nnations. \n 27 For the LORD of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall\ndisannul it? and his is the outstretched hand, and who shall\nturn it back? \n 28 In the year of the death of king Ahaz was this burden. \n 29 Rejoice not, Philistia, all. of thee, that the rod which smote\nthee is broken: for out of the \u2019s root shall come forth a\nviper, and its fruit a \ufb02ying fiery serpent. \n 30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy\nshall lie down in security; and I will kill-thy root with. famine,\nand he shall slay thy remnant. \n 31 Howl, gate; cry, city; melt away, Philistia, all of\nthee; for there cometh from the north a smoke, and there is\nno straggler in his ranks. \n 32 And what shall one answer the messengers of a nation?\nThat the LORD hath founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted\nof his \u2019e take refuge. \n XV. 1 The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab\nis laid waste, is destroyed; for in a night Kit- of Moab is laid\nwaste, is destroyed: \n \n \n\n \n 24 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts: As I have spoken, so shall\nit be, and as I have counselled, so shall it abide, \n 25 To destroy the Assyrians from my land, and from my\nmountains; and they shall be trodden down, and their yoke\nshall be stripped from off them, and their renown shall be\nstripped from off their shoulders. \n 26 This is the counsel which the Lord hath counselled against\nthe whole world, and this (is) his hand, which is upraised against\nall the nations of the world. \n 27 For what God, the Holy, has counselled, who shall scatter?\nand his hand, that is upraised, who shall turn away? \n 28 In the year that the king Ahaz died came this word. \n 29 May ye not rejoice, all ye strangers, for that the yoke of\nhim that smote you is broken; for from \u2019 seed shall come\nforth the offspring of asps, and their offspring shall come forth,\n\ufb02ying serpents. \n 30 And through him shall beggars feed, and beggar men shall\nrest in peace; but he shall destroy thy seed with famine, and thy,\nremnant shall he destroy. \n 31 Wail, ye gates of cities; let cities that are confounded cry\nout, all ye strangers: for from the north a smoke cometh, and\nthere is no means to continue. \n 32 And what shall the kings of the nations answer? That\nthe Lord hath founded Zion, and through him shall the humble\namong the people be saved. \n XV. 1 The Vision against the land of Moab. \n By night shall the land of Moab perish, for by night shall the\nwall of the land of Moab perish. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 He is gone up to the house, and Dibon, the high places, to\nweep; Moab howleth upon Nebo, and upon Medeba; on all his\nheads (is) baldness, every beard cut off. \n 3 In his streets they are girded with sackcloth; on her roofs\nand in her broad places all of her howleth, running down with\nweeping. \n 4 And Heshbon crieth, and Elealeh; their voiCe is heard unto\nJahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry out; his soul\ntrembleth within him. \n 5 My heart crieth out for Moab; her bars reach unto Zoar;\na heifer of three years old: for the ascent of Luhith, with\nweeping doth he go up by it; for in the way of Horonaim\nthey raise a cry of destruction. \n 6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolations; the grass is\nwithered, the herbage is consumed, there is no green thing. \n 7 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and their treasure,\nshall they carry away over the brook of willows. \n 8 For the cry is gone round about the borders of \u2019 Moab;\nher howling (hath reached) unto Eglaim, and to Beer-elim her\nhowling. \n 9 For \u2019waters of Dimon are full of blood; forI will bring\nmore upon Dimon, a lion for the escaped of Moab, and for the\nremnant of the land. \n XVI. r. Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land, from\nSela toward the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of\nZion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Grieve ye for yourselves; for Dibon also shall perish, where\nyour altar is; there shall ye go up to weep, upon Nebo of the\nland of Moab. Wail: (let there be) baldness on every head, all\narms cut in pieces. \n 3 In her highways gird yourselves with sackcloth, and smite\nyourselves on her housetops and in her highways and in her\nstreets; wail, \u2019of-you, with weeping. \n 4 For Heshbon hath cried aloud, and <Elealeh>; until\nvoice was heard; therefore the loins of the land of Moab cry out,\nher heart shall learn. \n 5 The heart of the land of Moab crieth aloud within her unto\nZoar; for she is (as) a heifer of three years old; and on the\nascent of Luhith shall they go up weeping unto thee, by the way\nof Horonaim; destruction crieth out, and an earthquake; \n 6 The water of Nimrim shall be desolate and the grass thereof\nshall fail; for there shall be no green grass. \n 7 Is she like to be saved, even thus? for I will bring (the)\nArabians upon the valley, and they shall take it. \n 8 For the cry hath reached the mountain of the land of Moab,\nOf Eglairn, and her wailing unto the well of Elim. \n 9 But the waters of Dimon shall be \ufb01lled with blood; for I\n\u2019will bring (the) Arabians upon Dimon, and I will remove the\nseed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adamah. \n XVI. r I will send as it were creeping things upon the earth:\nis the mount of Zion a desolate rock? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And it shall be, like wandering birds, a scattered nest, shall\nthe daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon. \n 3 Apply counsel, execute a decision; make thy shadow as the\nnight in the midst of the noonday; hide outcasts; discover not\nhim that wandereth. \n 4 Let the outcasts of Moab dwell with thee; be thou a hiding\nplace to them from the face of the destroyer; for the extortioner\nis brought to an end, destruction is \ufb01nished, the trampler is\nconsumed out of the land. \n 5 And a throne is established in mercy, and one shall sit upon\nit in truth in the tent of David, judging, and seeking judgment,\nand swift to do righteousness. \n 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab, proud ekceedingly;\nhis proudness, and his pride, and his wrath; not so are his\nboastings. \n 7 Therefore Moab shall howl for Moab, altogether shall he\nhowl; for the raisin cakes of Kir-haresheth shall ye mourn, utterly\nsmltten. \n 8 For the \ufb01elds of Heshbon languish; the vine of Sibmah, the\nlords of nations struck down her choice plants; they reached\nunto Jazer, they strayed into the wilderness; her offshoots spread\nabroad, they went over the Sea. \n 9 Therefore I will weep with theweeping of Jazer (for) the\nvine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, OHeshbon and\nElealeh; for on thy summer fruit and on thy harvest shouting is\nfallen. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 For thou shalt be as a nestling taken away, when a bird\n\ufb02ieth up, daughter of Moab: against thee, Amon, yet further \n 3 Take counsel, and make a shelter from trouble for thyself\ncontinually; in midday darkness they \ufb02ee, they are amazed;\n(see) lest thou be an exile. \n 4 The exiles shall sojourn <with thee> Moab; for they shall\nbe a shelter to you from the face of a pursuer; for thine alliance\nis taken away, misery is fulfilled, and the ruler is perished that\ndid trample upon the earth. \n 5 And a throne shall be established with mercy, and he shall\nsit upon it with truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and\nseeking out judgment, and hasting righteousness. \n 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab; very proud is he;\nthou hast up his haughtiness. Not thus is thy prophesying,\nnot thus. \n 7 Moab shall wail; fOr in the land of Moab shall all wail;\nthou shalt take care for them that dwell in Deseth, and shalt not\nregard them. \n 8 The plains of Heshbon shall mourn, and the vine of Sibmah;\nswallowing up the nations, tread ye down her vines, unto Jazer;\nye shall not reach, nor wander in the wilderness; they that\nwere sent forth were forsaken; for they crossed over the\ndesert. \n 9 Therefore will I weep as the weeping of Jazer, for the vine \u2019\nof Sibmah; he cast down thy trees, Heshbon, and <Elealeh>;\nupon thy harvest and thy vintage will I tread, and all shall fall. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 And taken away is joy, and gladness, from the garden\nland; and iri the vineyards there is no singing, no calling; the\ntreader treadeth no wine in the presses; I have made shouting\nto cease. \n 11 Therefore my bowels shall sound like the harp for Moab,\nand mine inward. parts for Kir-hares. \n 12 And it shall be, when Moab hath appeared, when he hath\nwearied himself upon the high place, and entereth his sanctuary\nto pray, (then) he shall not prevail. \n 13 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning\nMoab hitherto: \n 14 And now the LORD hath spoken, saying: Within three\nyears, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be\nbrought into contempt, with all the great multitude; and the.\nremnant shall be small, little, not strong. \n XVII. r The burden of Damascus. \n Behold, Damascus is removed from (being) a city, and be-\ncometh a heap, a ruin. \n 2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for \ufb02ocks,\nand they shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid. \n 3 And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom\nfrom Damascus, and the remnant of Aram: they shall be as the\nglory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of Hosts. \n 4 And it shall be in that day, the glory of \u2019Jacob shall be made\nthin, and the fatness of his \ufb02esh shall wax lean. \n \n\n \n 10 And joy shall be removed, and exultation, from thy vineyards,\nand in thy vineyards shall they not rejoice; and they shall\nnot tread wine into the vats, for it is ceased. \n 11 Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp upon Moab, and\n\u2019 mine inward-parts like a wall which thou didst newly build. \n 12 And it shall be, as to thy paying reverence, Moab is grown\nweary at the altars, she shall also enter in unto the works of\nhands so as to. pray, and shall not be able to deliver him. \n 13 This (is) the word that the Lord spake concerning Moab,\nwhat time he also spake. \n 14 And now I say, Within three years, of the years of a hireling,\nshall the glory of Moab be dishonoured with all (his) much\nwealth, and shall be left very small and not honourable. \n XVII. I The word against Damascus. \n Behold, Damascus shall be removed from (among) cities, and\nshall become a ruin, \n 2 Deserted for ever, for a place for \ufb02ocks to lie down and herds\nto rest, and there shall be none that chaseth them. \n 3 And no longer shall it be strong, for Ephraim to take refuge;\nand no longer there be a kingdom in Damascus, and the\nremnant of the Syrians: for thou art not better than the sons\nof Israel, and their glory. \n 4 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, There shall be in that day\na failing of the glory of Jacob, and the fat things of his glory\nshall be shaken. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 And it shall be as when the harvestman graspeth the standing\nCorn, and his arm reapeth the ears 3 and it shall be as one that\ngleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim. \n 6 And there shall be left therein gleanings, as at the beating of\nan olive tree, two or three berries at the top of a crest, four or \ufb01ve\nin the fruit \u2019s branches, saith the LORD God of Israel. \n 7 In that day shall (a) man look toward -his Maker, and his\neyes shall gaze upon the Holy One of Israel. \n 8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,\nneither shall gaze upon what his \ufb01ngers made, either the Asherim\nor the sun-images. \n 9 In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken tract of\n-the woodland and the mountain crest, which men forsook from\nbefore the children of Israel 5 and there shall be a desolation. \n 10 For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast\nnot been mindful of the rock of thy strength; therefore thou\nplantest plants of pleasantness, and settest them with slips of a\nstranger; \n 11 In the day of thy planting dost thou make a hedge, and in\nthe morning thou makest thy seed to bud; a harvest heap in the\nday; of pain and deadly sorrow. \n 12 Ah, the uproar of many peoples, they roar like the roaring\nof seas; and the tumult of nations, they are tumultuous like the\ntumult of mighty waters l \n 13 Nations are tumultuous like the tumult of many waters; and\n(one) rebuketh him, and he \ufb02eeth afar off, and is chased as the\nchaff of the mountains before the wind, and as whirling dust before\nthe tempest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 And it shall be like as if one gather a standing harvest, and\nreap the seed of ears of corn with his arm; and it shall be like as\nif one gather an ear of corn in a barren valley, \n 6 And there be left in it a stalk, or as it were olive berries,\ntwo or three on high in the air, or four or \ufb01ve upon the branches\nthereof. Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel. \n 7 In that day shall a man trust in him that made him, and his\neyes shall look unto the Holy One of Israel. \n 8 And they shall not trust in their altars, nor in the works of\ntheir hands, which their \ufb01ngers made; and they shall not look\nupon their groves, nor their abominations. \n 9 In that day shall thy cities be abandoned, like as the Amorites\nand the Hivites abandoned them from before the children of\nIsrael; and they shall be desolate. \n 10 Because thou didst abandon God thy Saviour, and \u03c4\u03b5\u0387\nmemberedst not the Lord thy helper. Therefore shalt thou plant\nan unfaithful plant, and an unfaithful seed. \n 11 But in the day when thou plantest it, thou shalt wander;\nand in the morning if thou sowest, it shall blossom to harvest, in\nwhatsoever day thou shalt obtain it; and like a \u2019s father, thou\nshalt obtain it for (thy) sons. \n 12 Woe, the multitude of many nations: as a billowy sea, so\nshall ye be confounded, and the surface of many nations shall\nsound as water \n 13 As much water are many nations, as when much water is\nviolently borne along; and he shall cast him off, and pursue him\nafar, as the dust Of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and\nlike a whirlwind carrying along a circling dust cloud. I \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 At eventide, and behold terror; before the morning, he is\nnot. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them\nthat rob us. \n XVIII. I Ah, land of the rustling of wings, whichart beyond\nthe rivers of Cush ! \n 2 That sendest envoys on the sea, and in vessels of papyrus on\nthe face of the waters: Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall\nand polished, to a people terrible since it was and onward, a\nnation of line, line, and treading down, whose land the rivers\ndivide. \n 3 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,\nwhen a standard is lifted up on (the) mountains, see ye: and\nwhen a trumpet is blown, hear ye. \n 4 For so the Lord said unto me: I will be quiet, and I will\nbehold in my dwelling place, while there is clear heat upon the\nlight, a mist-cloud in the heat of harvest. \n 5 For afore the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the\n\ufb02ower becometh a ripening grape-bunch, he shall cut off the sprigs\nwith pruning hooks, and remove and cut down the branches. \n 6 They shall be left together unto the bird of prey of the\nmountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the bird-of prey\nshall summer upon it, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter\nupon it. \n 7 In that time shall a present be brought unto the Lord of\nHosts, a people tall and polished, and from a people terrible since\nit was and onward: a nation of line, line, and treading down,\nwhose land the rivers divide: unto the place of the name of the\nLord of Hosts, mount Zion. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 Toward evening there shall be trouble: before morning,\nand he shall not be; this is the portion of them that plundered\nyou, and the share for them that shared you. \n XVIII. 1 Ah, the wings of the ships of the land, beyond\nthe rivers of Ethiopia; \n 2 He that sendeth forth hostages upon the sea, and letters on\npapyrus above the water. For swift messengers shall go to a\nnation that is high, and a stranger people and a cruel; (what is\nbeyond it?) a nation not looked for, and trodden down. Now \u2019\n(as for) the rivers of the land \n 3 All of them, like as an inhabited land shall their land be\ninhabited; like as if a signal were raised from a mountain, like\nthe voice of a trumpet shall it be heard. \n 4 For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be safety in my\ncity as the light of midday heat, and as a cloud of dew in a day\nof harvest shall it be. \n 5 Before the harvest, when the blossom is perfect, and the sour \u2019\ngrape hath put forth its blossom; then shall he take away the\nlittle clusters with pruning hooks, and shall take away the sprigs and cut them off. \n 6 And shall leave them together for the fowls of the heaven\nand the beasts of the earth ; and the fogls of the heaven shall be\ngathered together unto them, and all the beasts of the earth shall\ncome unto him. \n 7 At that time shall presents be brought to the Lord of Hosts\nfrom a people crushed and torn, and from a people great from\nhenceforth and for ever; (it is) a nation hoping, and trodden\ndown, which is in the portion of the river of its land : to the place\nwhere is the name of the Lord of Hosts, the mount Zion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XIX. The burden of Egypt. \n 1 Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh to\nEgypt; and the false gods of Egypt shall shake at his presence,\nand the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. \n 2 And I will stir up Egypt against Egypt, and they shall \ufb01ght\neveryone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour;\ncity against city, kingdom against kingdom. \n 3 And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty in the midst\nof it; and I will swallow up the counsel thereof; and they shall\ninquire of the false gods, and the mutterers, and them that have\nfamiliar spirits, and the wizards. \n 4 And I will confine Egypt into the hand of a hard lord; and\na harsh king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Lord of\nHosts. \n 5 And the waters shall waste fromthe sea, and the river shall\nbe parched and dried up. \n 6 And the rivers shall stink, the canals of Mazor are emptied\nand parched up ; reed and \ufb02ag wither. \n 7 The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and\nevery sown \ufb01eld by the Nile, shall dry up, be driven away, and\nbe no more. \n 8 And the \ufb01shers shall sigh, and all they that cast angle into\nthe Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the face\nof the waters shall languish. \n 9 And they that work combed \ufb02ax, and they that weave white\ncloth, shall be ashamed. \n 6. \u2018canals\u2019: lit. Niles (Nile-arms): Mazor, a rare singular form of\nMizraim, Egypt: the word prob. meaning \u2018forti\ufb01cation.\u2019 \n\n \n XIX. A vision of Egypt. \n 1 Behold, the Lord sitteth upon a swift cloud, and shall\ncome to Egypt, and the works of \u2019s hands shall be shaken\nfrom before him, and their hearts shall be discomfited within\nthem. \n 2 And Egyptians shall rise up against Egyptians, and shall war\neach against his brother and each against his neighbour, and city\nshall rise up against city, and province against province. \n 3 And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be confounded within\nthem, and I will scatter their counsel, and they shall inquire of\ntheir gods and their images, and of them that speak from the\nearth, and of the ventriloquists, and the diviners. \n 4 And I will give Egypt over into the hands of men, harsh\nlords; and harsh kings shall lord it over them. Thus saith the\nLord of Hosts. \n 5 And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is. beside the\nsea, and the river shall fail, and be dried up. \n 6 And the rivers and the trenches of the river shall fail, and\nevery gathering together of water shall be dried up, and (the water)\nin every marsh of reed and rush, \n 7 And the green meadow-grass, all that is round about the\nriver, and all that which is sown about the river, shall be dried up,\nblasted by the wind. \n 8 And the \ufb01shers shall mourn, and all they that cast hook into\nthe river shall mourn, and they that cast nets, and the \ufb01shermen\nshall grieve. \n 9 And shame shall seize on them that work the carded \ufb02ax, and\nthem that work the linen. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 And her pillars shall be broken in pieces ; all that work for\nhire (shall be) grieved in soul. \n II Merely fools are the princes of Zoanf as for the wise\ncounsellors of Pharaoh, counsel is become brutish; how can ye\nsay unto Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient\nkings? \n 12 Where, then, are thy wise men? (and) let them declare now\nunto thee, and let them know, what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed\nupon Egypt. \n 13 The princes of Zoan are befooled, the princes of Noph are\ndeceived: they have led Egypt astray, the cornerstone of her\ntribes. \n 14 The Lord hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst\nof her; and they have led Egypt astray in all his work, as a\ndrunkard strays in his vomit. \n 15 Neither shall there be a work for Egypt, whichihead or tail,\npalm branch or rush, can do. \n 16 In that day shall Egypt be as women, and shall tremble\nand fear before the face of the waving of the hand of the Lord\nof Hosts, which he waveth over it. \n 17 And the land of Judah shall be for a terror to Egypt; whosoever\nmaketh mention of it, unto him they turn in fear, before\nthe purpose of the LORD of Hosts, which he purposeth\nconcerning it. \n 18 In that day shall there be \ufb01ve cities in the land of Egypt\nspeaking the language of Canaan, and swearing to the Lord of\nHosts; one shall be called, City of destruction. \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 And they that <weave> them shall be in pain, and\nthat make strong drink shall be. grieved, and shall afflict their\nsouls, \n 11 And the rulers of Tanis shall be fools; the wise counsellors\nof the king, their counsel shall be turned to foolishness. How\nwill ye say to the king, We are sons of men of understanding, sons\nof kings which were from the beginning? \n 12 Where are now thy wise men? let them even proclaim to\nthee, and let them tell, what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed\nupon Egypt. \n 13 rulers of Tanis have failed, and the rulers of\nare uplifted: and they shall make Egypt to wander in her\ntribes. \n 14 For the Lord hath mingled for them a spirit of wandering, and\nthey have made Egypt to wander in all their works, as wandereth\nthe drunken man, and he that vomiteth, together. \n 15 And there shall be no work for the Egyptians which shall\nmake head or tail, beginning or end. \n 16 But in that day shall the Egyptians be like women, in fear\nand trembling, before the face of the hand of the Lord of Hosts,\nwhich he shall lay upon them. \n 17 And the land of the men of Judah shall be a (cause of)\nterror to the Egyptians; everyone, whosoever maketh mention of\nit to them, they shall be afraid, because of the counsel of the Lord\nof Hosts, which the Lord hath counselled against it. \n 18 In that day shall there be \ufb01ve cities in Egypt speaking in the\nlanguage of Canaan, and swearing in the name of the Lord; the\none city shall be called, City of Asedek. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 19\tIn that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the\nmidst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar near the border of it to\nthe Lord. \n 20\tAnd it shall be for a sign and a witness unto the Lord of\nHosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord\nbecause of (the) oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and\na mighty one, and shall deliver them. \n 21\tAnd the Lord shall make himself known to Egypt, and the\nEgyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall serve with\nsacrifice and (meal) offering; and they shall vow a vow unto the\nLord, and perform it \n 22\tAnd the Lord shall smite Egypt, smiting, and healing: and\nthey shall return unto the Lord, and he shall (let himself) be\nintreated of them, and shall heal them. \n 23\tIn that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria;\nand Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and\nthe Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.\n14 In that day shall Israel be a third to Egypt and Assyria,\na blessing in the midst of the earth ; \n 25 Forasmuch as the Lord of Hosts hath blessed him, saying,\nBlessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands,\nand mine inheritance, Israel. \n XX. 1 In the year that the Tartan came unto Ashdod,\n(when Sargon king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against\nAshdod, and took it: \n 2 At that timi spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amoz,\nsaying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and pull\noff thy shoe from thy foot And he did so, going naked and\nbarefoot. \n \n \n\n \n 19 In that day shall there be the altar to the Lord in the\nEgyptians\u2019 land, and a pillar at its boundary to the \n 20 And it shall be for a sign for ever to the Lord in the land of\nEgypt; for they shall cry unto the Lord because of them that\noppress them, and the Lord shall send them a man, who shall save\nthem: he shall judge and save them. \n 21 And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians; and the\nEgyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall offer sacrifices\nand shall make vows to the Lord, and render them. \n 22 And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a great stroke,\nand heal them with a healing; and they shall turn unto the Lord,\nand he shall hear them, and shall heal them. \n 23 In that day shall there be a way from Egypt to the\nAssyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt; and the\nEgyptians shall go unto the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall\nserve the Assyrians. \n 24 In that day shall Israel be a third among the Assyrians and\namong the Egyptians, blessed in the land \n 25 Which the Lord of Hosts (hath) blessed, saying, Blessed is\nmy people that is in Egypt and among the Assyrians, and. the\nland of mine inheritance, Israel. \n XX. 1 In the year when Tartan came to Azotus, when he\nwas sent by Sargon king of the Assyrians, and warred against\nAzotus and. took it, \n 2 Then spake the LORD to Isaiah, saying, Go, and take off the\nsackcloth from thy loins, and loose thy shoes from thy feet, and so\ndo, walking naked and barefoot. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath gone\nnaked and barefoot, three years a sign and a portent upon Egypt\nand upon Cush: \n 4 So shall the king of Asshur lead the captives of Egypt and\nthe exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with\nbuttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt. \n 5 And they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush\ntheir expectation and Egypt their glorying. \n 6 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,\nthus is our expectation, whither we tied for help, to be delivered\nfrom the face of the king of Asshur; and how shall we, we,\nescape? \n xxx. 1 The burden of the desert of the sea;\nLike whirlwinds in the south, sweeping along; it cometh from\nthe wilderness, from a terrible land. \n 2 A hard vision is declared unto me: the treacherous dealer\ndealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up,\n\u039f Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made\nto cease. \n 3 Therefore my loins are \ufb01lled with anguish ; pangs have taken\nhold upon me, like the pangs of a woman in travail; I am bowed\nwith pain, so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed, so that I\ncannot see. \n 4 My heart wandereth, horror affrighteth me; the twilight of\nmy desire hath he turned into trembling for me. \n 5 They prepare the table, they set the watch, eat, drink. Arise,\nye princes, anoint the shield. \n 5. Verbs in former part of verse are \ufb01nitives. \u2018set the watch\u2019:\n\u2018spread the carpets. \n\n \n 3 And the, Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked\nnaked and barefoot, three years there shall be signs and wonders\nto the Egyptians and Ethiopians. \n 4 For thus shall the king of the Assyrians lead away the captivity\nof Egypt and of the Ethiopians, young men and old men, naked\nand barefoot, uncovered, the shame of Egypt. \n 5 And the Egyptians shall be ashamed and discomfited concerning\nthe Ethiopians, upon whom the Egyptians had trusted,\nwho were their glory. \n 6 And they that dwell in this isle shall say, Behold, we had\ntrusted to \ufb02ee unto them for help, who could not be saved from\nthe king of the Assyrians; and how shall we be saved? \n XXI. 1 The vision of the desert. \n As a tempest passeth through the desert, coming from a desert,\nfrom the land. Fearful \n 2 Is the vision, and hard, that was proclaimed to me. He that\nsetteth at nought doth set at nought, and he that transgresseth\ndoth transgress. \n The Elamites are upon me, and the envoys of the Persians\nare coming against me. Now will I mourn, and will comfort\nmyself. \n 3 Therefore are my loins \ufb01lled with faintness, and pangs have\ntaken hold of me, as her that travaileth- ; I did wrong, so as not to\nhear, I laboured earnestly so \u2019 not to see. \n 4 My heart wandereth, and my transgression overwhelmeth me;\nmy soul turneth to fear. \n 5 Prepare the table, eat, drink ; stand up, ye rulers, and prepare\nshields. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 For thus bath the Lord said unto me, Go, place the watchman;\nwhat he shall see, let him declare. \n 7 And he saw a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop\nof camels; and he hearkened with utmost hearkenings. \n 8 And he cried (as) a lion, O Lord, I stand continually upon\nthe watchtower by day, and I am placed at my post all the\nnights: \n 9 And behold there cometh a troop of men, horsemen in\npairs; and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen;\nand all the (graven) images of her gods he hath broken unto the\nground. \n 10 O my threshing, and the son of my (threshing) \ufb02oor; that\nwhich I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,\nhave I declared unto you. \n 11 The burden of Dumah. \n One crieth to me out of Seir: Watchman, what (hour) of the\nnight? Watchman, what (hour) of the night? \n 12 The watchman said, Morning cometh, and also night. If ye\nwill inquire, inquire ye; return, come. \n 13 The burden upon Arabia. \n In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, ye caravans of Dedanim. \n 14 Bring ye water, to meet him that is thirsty; the inhabitants\nof the land of Tema welcome the fugitive with his bread. \n 15 For they are fugitives from the face of the swords, from the\nface of the drawn sword, and of the bent bow, and of the weight\nof war. \n 16 For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, as\nthe years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall be\nconsumed; \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 For thus saith the Lord to me, Go, set thee a watchman, and\nwhatsoever thou seest, tell it. \n 7 And I saw two mounted horsemen, one mounted on an ass,\nand one mounted on a camel. Hear with diligent hearing, \n 8 And call Uriah to the watch tower of the Lord. And he\nsaid, I have stood continually by day, and over the camp I stood\nthe whole night, \n 9 And behold, he himself cometh, mounted on a two-horse\nchariot. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen: and all her\nimages and the works of her hands are crushed into the earth. \n 10 Hear, ye that are left, and are in anguish, hear what I have\nheard from the Lord of Hosts: the God of Israel hath proclaimed\nit to us. \n The vision of Idum\u00e6a \n 11 To me ye call from Seir, Watch ye (the) battlements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 And the remnant of the number of bows, the mighty men\nof the sons of Kedar, shall be few; for the Lord, the God of\nIsrael, hath spoken it. \n XXII. The burden of the valley of vision. \n I What aileth thee, then, that thou art gone up, all of thee, to\nthe house tops? \n 2 She is \ufb01lled with tumult, an uproarious city, a jubilant\ntown; thy smitten ones are not smitten with the sword, nor dead\nin battle. \n 3 All thy rulers are fled together; without the bow they are\nmade captive; all that are found of thee are made captive, they\n\ufb02ed afar off \n 4 Therefore I said, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly;\npress not to comfort me, for the destruction of the daughter of my\npeople. \n 5 For the Lord God of Hosts hath a day of discomfiture, and\ntreading down, and perplexity, in the valley of vision; digging\ndown the wall, and a cry (goeth) to the mountain. \n 6 And Elam bare a quiver, with troops of men and horsemen,\nand Kir uncovered the shield. \n 7 And it cometh to pass, thy choice valleys are full of chariots,\nand the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate. \n 8 And he removed the covering of Judah, and thou didst look\nin that day to the armour of the house of the forest. \n 9 And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they\nwere many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower\npool \n 10 And ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses\ndid ye break down to fortify the wall. \n \n \n\n \n 17 And the remnant of the bows of the strong sons of Kedar\nshall be few; for the Lord, the God of Israel, hath spoken it. \n XXII. The vision of the valley of Zion. \n 1 What hath befallen thee now, that ye are all gone up to vain\nhouses ? \n 2 The city is \ufb01lled with men shouting; thy smitten ones are not\nsmitten with the sword, nor thy dead men dead in war. \n 3 All thy rulers are \ufb02ed; and they that are taken have been\ncruelly bound, and the strong ones in thee are \ufb02ed far away. \n 4 Therefore I said, Let me go, I will weep bitterly; persist not\nto comfort me, for the blow of the daughter of my race. \n 5 For it is a day of confusion and destruction, and of trampling\ndown, and a wandering from the Lord of Hosts; in the valley of\nZion they wander, from small to great they wander (on) to the\nmountains. \n 6 And the Elamites took quivers; mounted men upon horses,\nand a gathering of an array. \n 7 And there shall be thy chosen valleys, they shall be \ufb01lled with\nchariots, and the horsemen shall bar thy gates : \n 8 And they shall lay open the gates of Judah; and they shall\nlook in that day unto the chosen houses of the city. \n 9 And they shall lay open the secret things of the houses of\nthe citadel of David. And they saw that they were more in\nnumber, and that they had turned off the water of the old pool\ninto the city, \n 10 And that they had pulled down the houses of Jerusalem for\na fortification of the wall for the city. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And ye made a lake between the two walls for the water of\nthe old pool: but ye looked not unto him that made it, neither\nhad respect unto him that formed it long ago. \n 12 And in that day did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping,\nand to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: \n 13 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen slaughtering\nsheep, eating \ufb02esh and drinking wine: (Let us) eat and drink; for\ntomorrow we shall die. \n 14 And the Lord of Hosts revealed himself in mine ears: Surely\nthis iniquity shall not be expiated for you till ye die, saith the Lord\nGod of Hosts. \n 15 Thus saith the Lord God of Hosts, Go, get thee unto this\nsteward, unto Shebna which is over the house; \n 16 What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast\nhewed thee out a sepulchre here? Hewing him out his sepulchre\non high, graving a habitation in the rock for him ! \n 17 Behold, the Lord will hurl thee with the hurling of a mighty\nman, and seize thee with a seizing. \n 18 He will roll thee, rolling up into a roll, like a ball into a far\ncountry; there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory\nshall be: thou shame of thy lord\u2019s house. \n 19 And I will thrust thee from thy station, and from thine of\ufb01ce\nshall he pull thee down. \n 20 And it shall be in that day, I will call my servant Eliakim,\nthe son of Hilkiah; \n 21 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him\nwith thy girdle, and I will give thy authority into his hand; and\nhe shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the\nhouse of Judah. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And ye made for yourselves a (pool of) water between the\ntwo walls, further inward than the old pool ; and ye looked not to\nhim who made it from the beginning, and ye saw not him that \n 12 And the Lord of Hosts called it in that day weeping, and\nbeating of the breast, and shaving of the head, and girding with \n 13 But they on their part made merriment and exultation, slaying\noxen and slaughtering sheep, so as to eat \ufb02esh and drink wine,\nsaying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. \n 14 And this is revealed in the ears of the Lord of Hosts, that\nthis sin shall not be forgiven you until ye die. \n 15 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Go into the temple-chamber,\nunto Shebna the <treasurer> and say to \n 16 What dost thou here, and what hast thou to do here, that\nthou hast. hewn for thyself here a monument, and made for thyself\na monument on high, and graven an habitation for thyself in a rock? \n 17 Behold now, the Lord of Hosts will cast out and will\nroot out a man, and will take away thy robe, and thy crown\nof glory, 18 And shall hurl thee into a land, great without measure,\nand there shalt thou die; and shall turn thy \ufb01ne chariot to disgrace,\nand the house of thy ruler to be trodden down, \n 19 And thou shalt be taken from thy stewardship, and from\nthy state. \n 20 And. it shall be in that day, (that) I will call my servant\nEliakim, the son of Hilkiah; \n 21 And I will put on him thy robe, and thy crown will I\ngive him, and thy power; and thy stewardship will I give into\nhis halnds; and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in\nJerusalem. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 22 And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his\nshoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut, and he shall\nshut, and none shall open: \n 23 I will \ufb01x him as a peg in a sure place; and he shall be\nfor a throne of honour to his father's house. \n 24 And they shall hang upon him all the honour of his father's\nhouse, the offspring and the offshoots, all small vessels, from the\nvessels of bowls and even to the vessels of jars. \n 25 In that day, saith the LORD of Hosts, shall the peg that is\n\ufb01xed in a sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and\n:the burden that is upon it shall be cut off; for the Lord hath\nspoken it. \n XXIII. The burden of Tyre. \n 1 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there\nisno house, no entering in : from the land of Chittim it is revealed\nto them. \n 2 Be silent, ye inhabitants of the isle: the merchants of Zidon,\nthat pass over the sea, replenished thee. \n 3 And on great waters the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the\nNile, was her revenue ; and it was the gain of nations. \n 4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon ; for the sea, the stronghold of the\nsea, speaketh: I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither\nhave I nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins. \n 5 When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained\nat the report of Tyre. \n 6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 22 And I will give the glory of David unto him, and he shall\nrule, and there shall be none that gainsayeth him ; [and I will lay\nthe key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he shall\nopen, and there shall be none that shall shut; and he shall shut,\nand there shall be none that openeth] \n 23 And I will set him as a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be\nfor a throne of glory of his father's \n 24 And upon him shall every one trust, that is honourable in\nhis father's house, from small to great, and they shall be\nupon him \n 25 In that day. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts: The man that\nis \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed in a sure place shall be shaken, and shall fall, and\nthe glory that is upon him shall be taken away, for the Lord hath\nspoken it. \n XXIII. The vision of Tyre. \n 1 Wail, ye ships of Carthage, for (she) is perished, and they no\nlonger come from the land of Chittim; she is led captive. \n 2 To whom are they become like, that dwell in the isle?\ntraffickers of Phoenicia, crossing the sea, \n 3 On great waters, a seed of traffickers; as when a harvest is\ngathered in, (are) the traffickers of the nations. \n 4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon, saith the sea; and the strength\nof the sea saith, I travailed not, nor have I brought forth, non\nnourished young men, nor raised up virgins. \n 5 But when it shall become known in Egypt, anguish shall take\nhold of them concerning Tyre. \n 6 Depart unto Carthage: wail, ye that dwell in this isle. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 Is this your jubilant one? from the ancient days is her\nantiquity; her feet bore her far away to sojourn. \n 8 Who hath \u2019this against Tyre, the crowning city?\nwhose merchants were princes, whose traffickers were the honourable\nof the earth. \n 9 The Lord of Hosts hath purposed it, to profane the pride\nof all glory, to bring into contempt all the honourable of the\nearth. \n 10 Pass through thy land as the river, daughter of Tarshish 3\nthere is no girdle any more. \n 11 He hath stretched out his hand Over the sea, he hath disquieted\nkingdoms 3 the Lord hath given commandment concerning\nCanaan, to destroy the strongholds thereof. \n 12 And he said, Thou shalt no more be jubilant, thou outraged\nvirgin-daughter of Zidon 3 arise, pass over to Chittim; there also\nthou shalt have no rest. \n 13 Behold the land of the Chaldaeans; 3 this people not:\nAsshur founded it for desert creatures; they set up his (watch-)\ntowers, they roused up her palaces 3 he hath made her a ruin. \n 14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; 3 for your stronghold is\ndestroyed \n 15 And it shall be in that day, that Tyre shall beforgotten\nseventy years, as the days of one king; from the end of seventy\nyears shall it be to Tyre as the song of the harlot. \n 16 Take a harp, go about the city, forgotten harlot; 3 do well in\nplaying, do much singing, that thou mayest be remembered. \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 Was not this your pride which was from the beginning, before\nshe was delivered up? \n 8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre? is she weaker, or\nhath she no. strength? her merchants were honourable, rulers of\nthe earth \n 9 The Lord of Hosts hath counselled to undo the pride of the\nhonourable ones, and to disgrace all that is honourable upon the \n 10 Till thine own land : for indeed no longer come there ships\nfrom Carthage. \n 11 But thine hand is no longer strong by sea, thou that didst\nprovoke kings: the Lord of Hosts hath commanded concerning\nCanaan, to destroy her strength. \n 12 And they shall say, No longer shall ye any more insult and\ninjure the daughter of Zion ; and if thou depart to Chittim, neither\nthere shalt thou have rest ; \n 13 Or to the land of the Chaldaeans: that also is made desolate\nby the Assyrians: [neither there shalt thou have rest, for] the wall\nthereof is fallen. \n 14 Wail, ye ships of Carthage, for your stronghold is perished. \n 15 And it shall be in that day, Tyre shall be abandoned\nseventy years, as is the time of a king, as the time of a man;\nand it shall be after seventy <years> Tyre shall be as the\nof a harlot. \n 16 Take a harp, rove about, thou harlot city that art forgotten;\nplay sweetly, sing much, that there may be remembrance of thee.\nAnd it shall after seventy years, God shall make a visitation of\nTyre, and she shall turn again to her ancient way, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 And it shall be, from the end of seventy years, the Lord\nshall visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall play\nthe harlot with all the kingdoms of the earth on the face of the\nground. \n 18 And her gain and her hire shall be holy to the Lord:\nit shall not be treasured nor stored up ; but her gain shall belong\nto those that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for\nstately clothing. \n XXIV. 1 Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and\nmaketh it void, and overturneth the face thereof, and scattereth\nthe inhabitants thereof. \n 2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with\nthe servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her\nmistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender,\nso with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver\nof usury to him. \n 3 The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for\nthe Lord hath spoken this word. \n 4 The earth mourneth, fadeth ; the world languisheth, fadeth;\nthe highness of the people of the earth languisheth. \n 5 And the earth is become impious under her inhabitants; for\nthey have transgressed the laws, overstepped the statute, broken\nthe everlasting covenant. \n 6 Therefore hath a curse devoured the earth, and the inhabitants\nof it are held guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are\nburned, and few men left. \n 7 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the\nmerryhearted do sigh. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 And shall be a port of merchandise for all the kingdoms of\nthe world. \n 18 And her merchandise, and her hire, shall be holy to the\n\u2019 Lord: it shall not \u2019 gathered together for them, but for those\nthat dwell before the Lord; all her merchandise, to eat, and to\ndrink, and to be \ufb01lled, and for a contribution, as a memorial\n< before the \n XXIV. 1 Behold, the Lord destroyeth the world, and will\nlay it desolate, and will uncover the face thereof, and scatter the\ninhabitants thereof. \n 2 And the people shall be as the priest, and the servant\nas the lord, and the maid as the lady; the buyer shall be as\nthe seller, the lender as the borrower, and the debtor as he to\nwhom he oweth. \n 3 The earth shall be utterly destroyed, and the earth shall be\nutterly spoiled; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this. \u2019 \n 4 The earth mourneth, and the world is destroyed; and the\nexalted ones of the earth do mourn. \n 5 And the earth transgresseth because of her inhabitants: be:\ncause they have overstepped (the) law, and changed the ordinances\nof the Lord, an everlasting covenant. \n 6 Therefore shall a curse devour the earth, because the inhabit-\nants of it have sinned ; therefore shall they that dwell in the earth\nbe poor, and few men shall be left. \n 7 The wine shall mourn, the vine shall mourn, all that are\njoyful in heart shall groan. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the uproar of the jubilant endeth,\nthe of the harp ceaseth. \n 9 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be\nbitter to them that drink it, \n 10 The city of wasteness is broken down; every house is shut\nup, not to enter. \n 11 There is a crying in the streets for wine; all joy is grown\ndark; the mirth of the land is gone. \n 12 There remaineth in the city desolation, and into ruin the\ngate is beaten down. \n 13 For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth among the\npeoples; as at the beating of an olive tree, as at the gleanings\nwhen the vintage is done. \n 14 These shall lift up their voice, they shall sing; because of\nthe majesty of the Lord, they cry aloud from the sea. \n 15 Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the lights, the name of the\nLord God of Israel in the isles of the sea \n 16 From the comer of the earth have we heard songs, Honour\nto the righteous. And I said, Wasting for me, wasting for me,\nwoe to me ! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea,\nthe treacherous dealers have indeed dealt treacherously. \n 17 Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of\nthe earth \n 18 And it shall be, he who \ufb02eeth from the voice of the fear\nshall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst\nof the pit shall be taken in the snare; for windows from on high\nare opended, and the foundations of the earth do shake. \n 19 The earth is utterly broken, the earth is utterly shattered, the\nearth is utterly uprooted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 Ceased is the joy of tabrets, ceased is the arrogance and\nwealth of the wicked, ceased the voice of the harp. \n 9 They are ashamed, they drink not wine; the strong drink\nbecometh bitter to them that drink. \n 10 Every city is made desolate; it shall shut up the house,\nthat none come in. \n 11 Wail, for the wine, everywhere; ceased is all joy of the\nland, \n 12 And cities shall be left desolate, and houses left therein\nshall perish. \n 13 All this shall be in the land, in the midst of the nations;\nlike as if one gleaneth an olive tree, so shall they glean them;\nand (as) if the vintage have ceased. \n 14 These shall cry aloud with their voice, but they that are left\nupon the earth, shall rejoice together with the glory of the Lord,\nthe water of the sea shall be troubled \n 15 Therefore the glory of the Lord shall be in the isles of the\nsea, the name of the Lord shall be glorious. \n 16 O Lord God \u2019Israel, from the corners of the earth have\nwe heard wonders, Hope (is) for the righteous. And they shall\nsay, Woe to them that set at nought; as for. them that set at\nnought the law, \n 17 Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are upon you that dwell upon\nthe earth. \n 18 And it shall be, he that \ufb02eeth from the fear shall fall into\nthe pit; and he that cometh out from the pit shall be caught by\nthe snare; for windows are opened out of heaven, and the foundations\nof the earth shall be shaken. \n 19 The earth shall be clean confounded, and the dearth shall be\nutterly helpless. \n \n \n \n\n \n 20 The earth staggereth like a drunkard, and swayeth to and fro\nlike a but; and the rebellion thereof is heavy upon it; and it shall\nfall, and not rise again. \n 21 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall visit (upon) the\nhost of the height in the height, and the kings of the earth upon\nthe earth. \n 22 And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered, into a\npit, and after many days shall they be visited. \n 23 And the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed; for\nthe LORD of Hosts is King in mount Zion, and before his elders\n(there is) glory. \n XXV. 1 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will\npraise thy name; for thou hast done a wonder; counsels from of\nold, truth, true. \n 2 For thou hast made of a city a heap; a fenced town to be\na ruin; a castle of strangers to be no city; it shall not be built,\nfor ever. \n 3 Therefore shall a strong people honour thee, the city of the\nterrible nations shall fear thee. \n 4 For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to\nthe needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from\nthe heat; for the blast of the terrible (ones) is as a (rain)storm\nupon a wall. \n \n \n \n\n \n 20 The earth tottereth and shall be shaken, like a but, like him\nthat is drunken and reeling; and shall fall, and shall not be able\nto rise again, for her transgression is strong upon her. \n 21 And God shall bring his hand against the array of heaven,\nand against the kings of the earth. \n 22 And they shall gather them together, and shut them into a\nfastness, and into a prison ; after many generations shall there be\na visitation of them. \n 23 And the brick shall decay, and the wall shall fall; for the\nLord shall reign in Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before the elders \u2019\nshall he be glorified \n XXV; A Song. \n 1 O Lord my God, I will glorify thee, I will praise thy name;\nfor thou hast done wonderful things, a counsel ancient and true.\nAmen, O Lord. \u2019 \n 2 For thou hast laid cities in a dust heap, strong cities, that\ntheir foundations should fall; the city of the wicked shall not be\nbuilt, for ever. \n 3 Therefore shall the people that is poor praise thee, and cities\nof men that suffer wrong shall bless thee. \n 4 For thou art become a helper to every humble city, and\na shelter to them that despair, for want ; from evil men shalt thou\nrescue them\u2014a shelter for the thirsty, and a breath of men\nsuffer wrong [shall bless thee], \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Thou shalt subdue the uproar of strangers, like heat in a\nparched land 3 (as) heat by the shadow of a cloud 3 the song of\nthe terrible shall be brought low. \n 6 And in this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all\npeoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat\nthings full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined \n 7 And he will swallow up in this mountain the face of the\nveil that veileth all peoples, and the covering that covereth all\nnations. \n 8 He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord GOD\nwill wipe away tears from off all faces 3 and the reproach of his\npeople shall he take away from 06 the earth 3 for the Lord hath\nspoken it. \n 9 And one shall say in that day, Lo, this is our God 3 we waited\nfor him, and he will save us ; this is the LORD, we waited for him 3\nwe will be glad and rejoice in his salvation \n 10 For on this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and\nMoab shall be trampled in his place, as straw is trampled in the\nwater of the dung pit. \n 11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof,\nas he that swimmeth spreadeth forth (his hands) to swim 3 and\nhe shall lay low his haughtiness, together With the wiles of his\nhands. \u2019 \n 12 And the fortress of the high place of thy walls hath he brought\ndown, laid low, brought to the ground, even to the dust. \n XXVI. r In. that day shall this song be sung in the land\nof Judah: We have a city of strength; salvation will he appoint\nfor walls and rampart. \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 As men faint hearted, thirsting in Zion,\u2014from wicked\nto whom thou gavest us over. \n 6 And the Lord of hosts shall do (it) for all the nations;\nupon this mountain shall they drink gladness, they shall drink\nwine \n 7 They shall anoint themselves with myrrh in this mountain.\nGive over all this to the nations; for this counsel is against all the\nnations. \n 8 Death was strong, and swallowed them up; and again God\nhath taken away every tear from every face; he hath taken away\nthe shame of the people from all the earth, for the mouth of the\nLord hath spoken. \n 9 And they shall say in that day, Behold our God, in whom\nwe ever hoped; and we were triumphant, and will rejoice in our\nsalvation. \n 10 For God will give us rest upon this mountain, and the land\nof Moab shall be trodden down, like as they tread a threshing\n\ufb02oor in wagons. \n 11 And he will let go his hands, like as he himself also humbled\nhim to destroy him; and he shall humble his pride, whereto he\nlaid his hands. \n 12 And the height of the refuge of thy wall shall be humble,\nand it shall come down, even unto the ground. \n XXVI. A Song. \n 1 In that day shall they sing this song over the land of Judah ;\nsaying, Behold, a strong city; and he shall set salvation for us\nfor the wall and the outer, wall. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Open ye the gates, that a righteous nation which keepeth\ntruth may enter in., \n 3 A steadfast mind thou keepest in peace, peace; because he\nis secure in thee. \n 4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever ; for in Jah the Lord is a\nRock of Ages. \n 5 For he hath brought doWn the dwellers in the height, the\nlofty city 3 he bringeth. it low, bringeth it low even to the earth ;\nhe bringeth it even to the dust. \n 6 The foot shall trample on it, the feet Of the afflicted, the\nsteps of the poor. \n 7 The way for the righteous is straightness; thou levellest\nstraight the path of the righteous. \n 8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited\nfor thee 3 the desire of our soul is for thy Name and thy\nmemorial. \n 9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night: yea, with\nmy spirit within me will I seek thee early ; for when thy judgments\nare upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn\nrighteousness. \n 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, he learneth not\nrighteousness ; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly,\nand will not look upon the majesty of the Lord \n 11 Lord, thy hand is lifted up, they will not see ; they shall\nsee, and be ashamed at the jealousy for a people ; yea, \ufb01re shall\ndevour thine enemies. \n 12 Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us ; for all our works\nalso hast thou wrought for us. \n 13 O Lord our God, otherllords beside thee have had dominion\nover us 3 through thee only will we make mention of thy name. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Open ye the gates, let a people enter which keepeth righteousness\nand keepeth truth, \n 3 Laying hold of and keeping peace. For in\nthee \n 4 They have hoped, for ever, O Lord, the great, the ever\nlasting God, \n 5. Who didst humble and bring down them that dwelt in high\nplaces; strong cities shalt thou throw down, and bring down\nto the ground, \n 6 And the feet of the gentle and humble shall tread upon\nthem. \n 7 The way of the godly is become straight; and the way of\nthe godly (is) prepared. \n 8 For the way of the Lord is judgment; we have hoped in\nthy name, and in the remembrance, \n 9 Which our soul longeth for. [A Song] Out of the night\ndoth my spirit rise early toward thee, O God, because thy\ncommandments are a light upon the earth. Learn righteousness,\nye that dwell on the earth, \n 10 For ceased is the ungodly; he will not learn righteousness\nupon the. earth, he will not perform truth; let the wicked be\nremoved, that he may not see the glory of the Lord. \n 11 Lord, thy arm is uplifted, and they knew it not; but when\nthey learn it, they shall be ashamed; jealousy shall take hold of\na people that is untaught, and now shall \ufb01re devour the\nenemies. \n 12 Lord, our God, grant peace to us, for all things dost thou\ngive us. \n 13 Lord, our God, take us for thine own; O Lord, beside.\nthee we know none other, thy name do we name. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 Dead, they shall not live; shades, they shall not rise;\ntherefore hast thou visited ahd destroyed them, and made all\ntheir memory to perish. \n 15 Thou hast increased, the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased\nthe nation; thou hast gotten thee glory; thou hast\nenlarged all the borders of the land. \n 16 Lord, in trouble have they inquired for thee; they uttered\na whisper]; thy correction was upon them. \n 17 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time\nof her delivery, doth writhe, crieth out in her pangs; so were\nwe at thy presence, O Loan. \n 18 We were with child, we writhed, we brought forth as it\nwere wind; we wrought not salvation (for) the earth, neither have\ninhabitants of the earth fallen. \n 19 Thy dead ones shall live, my dead body shall arise: Awake\nand sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is the dew of\nlights, and the earth shall cast forth shades. \n 20 Go, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy\ndoors about thee; hide thyself for a little moment, until the\nindignation be passed by. \n 21 For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place, to visit the\niniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him; and the earth\nshall disclose her bloodshed, and shall no more cover her slain. \n XXVII. 1 In that day the lord with his hard and great\nand strong sword will visit (upon) leviathan the \ufb02eeing serpent,\nand leviathan the coiled serpent; and he shall slay the dragon\nthat is in the sea. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians\nraise them up; for this cause didst thou bring them in, and\ndestroyedst them, and removedst all that was male among them. \n 15 Add unto them evils, O Lord, add evils to all the glorious\nones of the earth. \n 16 Lord, in affliction I remembered thee, in slight affliction\n(was) thy correction upon us. \n 17 And as she who travaileth draweth near to bring forth, and\ncrieth out in her travail, so were we before thy beloved. \n 18 For the fear of thee, O Lord, did we conceive, and\ntravailed, and brought forth; we made a breath of thy salvation\nupon the earth, but they that dwell upon the earth shall fall. \n 19 For the dead shall arise, and they that are in the tombs\nshall be roused up, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice;\nfor the dew that cometh from thee is healing to them, but the\nland of the ungodly shall fall. \n 20 Go, my people, enter into thy chambers, shut thy door,\nhide thyself ever so little a while, until the wrath of the Lord be\npassed by. \n 21 For behold, the Lord from his holy (place) bringeth his\nanger upon them that dwell upon-the earth; and the earth shall\nreveal her <blood>, and the earth shall not cover up the \n XXVII. 1 In that day shall God bring his sword, the holy,\nand great, and strong, against the dragon, the serpent that \ufb02eeth,\nagainst the dragon, the crooked serpent, and shall slay the\ndragon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 In that day, a vineyard of foaming wine ; sing ye to it ; \n 3 I the LORD am its keeper 3 every moment I water it; lest\nany hurt it, I keep it night and day. \n 4 Wrath have I none; who will set briers and thorns against\nme in battle? I would march against it, I would burn it all\ntothether \n 5 Or else let him lay hold of my stronghold, make peace with\nme: let him make peace with me. \n 6 As to what cometh, Jacob shall take root, Israel shall\nblossom and bud, and they shall \ufb01ll the face of the earth with\nfruit. \n 7 Hath he smitten him according to thesmiting of those that\nsmote him 3 or is he slain according to the slaying of his slain? \n 8 In exact measure, by sending her away, thou contendest\nwith her; he driveth her away with his rough wind in the day\nof the east wind. \n 9 Therefore by this shall the guilt of Jacob be expiated; and\nthis is all the fruit, taking away his sin ; when he maketh all the\nstones of the altar like chalkstones dashed in pieces, the Asherim\nand sun-pillars arise no more. \n 10 For the defenced city is solitary, an habitation deserted\nand forsaken like the wilderness ; there shall the calf feed, and\nthere shall he lie down, and consume her branches. \u2019 \n 11 In the \u2019withering of her boughs they shall be broken off 3\nwomen cOme, and set them on \ufb01re ; for it is not a people of\ndiscernment: therefore he that made them hath no compassion\non them, and he that formed them sheweth them no favour. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 In that day (shall there be) a fair vineyard; (there is) a\ndesire to begin (a song) upon her. \n 3 I am a strong city, a city besieged; in vain shall I water\nit; for it shall be taken by night, but by day shall the wall fall. \n 4 There is none but she laid hold upon her; who shall set\nme to guard a reed in a \ufb01eld? because of this enemy's\nhave I set her at nought. Therefore for this cause bath the Lord\nGod done all things that he appointed. I am burnt up, \n 5 They that dwell in her shall cry: Let us make peace with\nhim, let us make peace. \n 6 They that come, the children of Jacob shall bud, and Israel\nshall blossom, and the world shall be \ufb01lled with the fruit. \n 7 Shall it be that, as he himself smote, he also shall be\nstricken; and as himself slew, so he shall be slain? \n 8 Fighting and reproaching, he shall send them forth: wast\nthou not he that devised, with thy harsh spirit, to slay them with\na spirit of wrath? \n 9 Therefore shall the transgression of Jacob be taken away,\nand this is his blessing, when I have taken away his sin, when\nI have laid all the stones of the altars in fragments, as light\ndust; and their trees shall not remain, and their idols, destroyed\nas a forest (reaching) far. \n 10 The fold that is inhabited shall be left deserted, like an\nabandoned fold; and it shall be a feeding place for long time,\nand there shall they rest. \n 11 And after a time there shall not be in her any green thing,\nbecause of its drying up. Ye women that come from a spectacle,\ncome hither; for it is not a people that hath understanding;\ntherefore he that made them shall not pity, nor shall he that\nformed them have mercy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall beat out (corn)\nfrom the stream of the River, unto the brook of Egypt, and ye\nshall be gathered one by one, \u039f ye children of Israel. \n 13 And it shall be in that day, a great trumpet shall be blown;\nand they shall come which were lost in the land of Assyria, and\nthe outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the Lord in\nthe holy mount at Jerusalem. \n XXVIII. I Ah, the proud crown of the drunkards of\nEphraim, and the fading \ufb02ower of his glorious beauty, which is\non the head of the fat valley of them that are smitten down with\nwine! \n 2 Behold, the Lord hath a strong and mighty One, like a storm\nof hail, a tempest of destruction; like a storm of mighty overflowing\nwaters, he casteth it down to the ground with force. \n 3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be\ntrodden with feet; \n 4 And the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on\nthe head of the fat valley, shall be as an early \ufb01g before the\nsummer, which when any seeth, he swalloweth it while it is yet\nin his hand. \n 5 In that day shall the Lord of Hosts be for a crown of beauty\nand a diadem of glory unto the remnant of his people, \n 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth \u2019over the\njudgment, and for might to them that turn back war at the\ngate. \n 7 And these also have erred with wine, and are gone astray\nwith strong drink; priest and prophet have erred with strong\ndrink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are gone astray with\nstrong drink; they have erred. in vision, have wavered in decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall fence them in\nfrom the channel of the river unto Rhinocolura ; and ye, gather\ntogether one by one the children of Israel. \n 13 And it shall be in that day, they shall blow with the great\ntrumpet, and they shall come, <that perished> in the land of the\nAssyrians. and they that perished in Egypt, and shall (come to)\nworship the Lord at the holy mountain in Jerusalem. \n XXVIII. 1 Ah, for the crown of pride; (it is) the hirelings\nof Ephraim, the flower that falleth from the glory upon the crest\nof \u2019the fat mountain, they that are drunken without wine. \n 2 Behold, a mighty and a hard thing is the wrath of the Lord,\nlike a hailstorm rushing dbwn without shelter, rushing down with\nforce; like a great body of water sweeping a land, it shall cause\nrest to the land: with hands \n 3 And with feet shall the crown of pride be trampled down,\nthe hirelings of Ephraim. \n 4 And the \ufb02ower, that falleth from the hope of glory, shall be\nupon the top of the high mountain; like an early fruit of the\n\ufb01g, he that seeth it, before he take it into his hand, shall desire\nto swallow it up. \n 5 In that day shall the Lord of Hosts be the crown of hope\nthat is woven of the glory for him that is left of my\u2014 \n 6 And they shall be left,\u2014for a spirit of judgment, for\nand for might, forbidding to destroy. \n 7 For these are gone astray by reason of wine; they went\nastray because of the strong drink, priest and prophet left the\nway because of wine, they were disturbed from their revelling\nin strong drink, they went astray. This is a vision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 For all tables are full of \ufb01lthy vomit; there is no place\n(left). \n 9 Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to\ndiscern the message? those that are weaned from the milk,\nremoved from the breasts? \n 10 For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line\nupon line, line line upon line; here a little, there a little. \n 11 For with stamrnerings of lip and another tongue will he\nspeak to this people. \n 12 He who said to them, This is the. rest, give ye rest to the\nweary ; and this is the refreshing; and they would not hear. \n 13 And the word of the Lord shall be unto them precept upon\nprecept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line ; here\na little, there a little; that they may go, and stumble backward,\nand be broken, and snared, and taken. \n 14 Therefore hear the word of the lord, ye men of scorn,\nrulers of this people which is in Jerusalem. \n 15 Because ye have said: We have made a covenant with\ndeath, and have made an agreement with hell; the overflowing\nscourge, when it passeth through, shall not come unto us: for\nwe have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood have we hid\nourselves: \n 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am he that\nhath founded in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-,\nstone of sure foundation; he that believeth shall not be in\nhaste. \n 17 And I will set judgment for a line, and righteousness for\na, plummet ; and hail sweepeth the refuge of lies, and waters\nshall overflow the hiding place. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 A curse shall devour this counsel; for this counsel is for\ngreedicness\u00b4 \n 9 To whom did we declare evils, and to whom did we declare\na message? it is they who are weaned from milk, they who are\nwithdrawn from the breast. \n 10 Expect thou affliction upon affliction, hope upon hope, yet\na little, yet a little, \n 11 Because of contempt of the lips, through another tongue;\nfor they shall speak, to this people, \n 12 Saying unto it, This (is) the rest for the hungry, and this\n(is) the datruction ; and they would not hear. \n 13 And the oracle of the Lord God shall be unto them\naffliction upon affliction, hope upon hope, yet a little, yet a little,\nthat they may go, and fall backward; and they shall venture, and\nbe destroyed, and be taken. \n 14 Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye afflicted men, and\nrulers of this people, that is in Jerusalem. \n 15 Because ye say, We have made a covenant with hell, and\nagreements with death; if a rushing tempest pass by, it shall\nnot come upon us ; we have set falsehood for our hope, and by\nfalsehood will we be sheltered: \n 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will Set in the\nfoundations of Zion a stone, very precious, chosen out, a chief\ncorner stone, honourable ; in her foundations (I set it), and he\nwho believeth thereon shall not be ashamed. \u2019 \n 17 And I will set judgment for a hope, and my mercy shall\nbe for balances; and ye who vainly trust in a lie\u2014for the\nshall not pass you by, \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and\nyour agreement with hell shall not stand; the over\ufb02owing scourge,\nwhen it passeth through, ye shall be for it to tread down. \n 19 As oft as it passeth through, it shall take you away; for\nmorning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night;\nand it shall be sheer vexation to discern the message. \n 20 For the bed is too short for stretching oneself out, and the\ncovering too narrow when wrapping oneself. \n 21 For the Lord shall rise up as (in) mount Perazim, he\nshall be disquieted as (in) the valley of Gibeon, to do his deed\u2014\nstrange is his deed: and to work his work\u2014alien is his work. \n 22 And now deal ye not scoffingly, lest your bonds grow\nstrong; for a destruction and a decision have I heard from the\nLord God of Hosts, upon the whole earth. \n 23 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my\nspeech. \n 24 Is the ploughman always ploughing, to sow? (always)\nopening and harrowing his ground? \n 25 Doth he not, when he hath made plain the face thereof,\ncast abroad fennel, and scatter cummin, and set the wheat in\nrows, and barley in the appointed place, and spelt in the border\nthereof? \n 26 And he instructeth him according to judgment; his God\nteacheth him. \n 27 For fennel is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cart\nwheel rolled upon cummin; for fennel is beaten out with a staff,\nand cummin with a rod. \n 28 Bread (corn) is crushed ; for not for ever is he threshing it,\nand driving his cart wheel and his horses; he doth not crush it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 Lest also it take away your covenant of death, and your\nhope regarding hell shall not abide: if a rushing tempest come\nupon you, ye shall be trodden down by it. \n 19 When it passeth by, it shall take hold upon you; very\nearly shall it pass by by day, and by night it shall be an evil\nhope. Learn to hearken, \n 20 Being straitened; we cannot \ufb01ght, and of ourselves we are\nweak, to be assembled together. \n 21 As (at) the mount of ungodly men shall he stand up, and\nit shall be, in the valley of Gibeon, with wrath shall he do his\nworks, a work of bitterness; but his wrath shall deal strangely,\nand its bitterness shall be strange. \n 22 And ye, may ye not rejoice, and let not your bonds be\nstrong; for I have heard from the Lord of Hosts of doings,\nfulfilled and cut short, which he will perform upon all the land. \n 23 Give ear, and hearken to my voice; attend, and hear my\nwords. \u2019 \n 24 Will the ploughman plough all the day P or will he prepare\nthe sowing before he have tilled the land? \n 25 And, when he hath levelled the face of it, \ufb01rst he soweth\nsmall fennel and cummin, and again wheat, and barley, and spelt\nin thy borders. \n 26 And thou shalt be instructed by the judgment of thy God,\nand shalt rejoice. \n 27 For the fennel is not winnowedlwith harshness, nor will\nhe drive a cart wheel round upon the cummin ; but the fennel is\nshaken with a rod, and the cummin \n 28 Shall be eaten with bread. For not for ever will I be\nangered with you, neither shall the voice of my bitterness trample\nyou down. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 29 This also cometh forth from the Lord of Hosts; he\nmaketh counsel wonderful, he maketh wisdom great. \n XXIX. 1 Ah, Ariel, Ariel, city (where) David camped! add\nye year to year; let the feasts go round. \n 2 And I will distress Ariel, and there shall be lamentation and\nlament; and she shall be unto me as Ariel. \n 3 And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay\n\u2019 siege against thee with a mound, and raise siege works against\nthee : \n 4 And thou shalt be brought down, out of the earth shalt thou\nspeak, and thy speech shall come low from the dust; and thy\nvoice shall be as that of a ghost from the ground, and thy speech\nshall chirp out of the dust. \n 5 And the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,\nand the multitude of the terrible ones like passing chaff; and it\nshall be in a moment suddenly. \n 6 From the LORD of Hosts shall she be visited with thunder,\nand earthquake, and great noise; whirlwind, and tempest, and\n\ufb02ame of devouring \ufb01re. \n 7 And as a dream, a vision of the night, shall the multitude\nof all the nations be, that are arrayed against Ariel, even all that\nare arrayed against her and her fortress, and distress her. \n 8 And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and\nbehold, he eateth ; and he awaketh, and his SOul is empty; and\nas a thirsty man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; and he\nawaketh, and behold, he is faint, and his soul craveth; so shall\nall the multitude of the nations be, that are arrayed against\nmount Zion. \n \n 1. \u2018 \u2019 i.e. prob. \u2018lion of \u2019 or \u2018(altar) hearth of \u2019 \n 2. \u2018there shall be moaning and \u2019 (Cheyne). Heb. words are from\nsame root. \n 3. \u2018round \u2019: lit. \u2018like a \u2019: differs from \u2018like \u2019 only by\n ABBREV and ABBREV (and points). \n 5. \u2018multitude\u2019: word sometimes rendered \u2018uproar.\u2019 \n\n \n 29 And these wonders are come forth from the Lord of Hosts:\ntake counsel, lift up a vain appeal. \n XXIX. 1 Ah, city of Ariel, against which David made\nwar; collect fruits year after year: for ye shall eat with Moab. \n 2 For I will af\ufb02ict Ariel, and her strength and her wealth shall\nbe mine. \n 3 And I will make a circle like David against thee, and will\nset up a palisade around thee, and will plant towers against thee, \n 4 And thy wOrds shall be brought low unto the earth, and thy\nwords shall sink into the earth; and thy voice shall be as they\nthat speak from the earth, and close to the ground shall thy\nvoice be weak. \n 5 And like a dust cloud from a wheel shall the wealth of the\nungodly be, and like chaff borne along; and it shall be like a\nmoment, suddenly, \n 6 From the Lord of Hosts; for there shall be a viSitation\nwith crying aloud and earthquake; and with a great voice, a rush-\ning tempest and a \ufb02ame of \ufb01re devouring. \n 7 And as he that dreameth a dream shall be the wealth of\nall the nations that did march against Israel, and all they that\nmarched against Jerusalem, and all that were gathered together\nagainst her and af\ufb02icted her. \n 8 And they shall be like them that in sleep drink and eat, and\nwhen they arise, their dream is vain ; and like as he that is thirsty\ndreameth, as he that drinketh, and when he ariseth, he still\nthirsteth, and his soul hath hoped after an empty thing; so shall\nthe wealth be of all the nations, as many as did march against\nJerusalem, and against the mount Zion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 Astonish yourselves, and be astonished; blind yourselves,\nand be blind: they are drunken, and not with wine; they reel,\nand not with strong drink. \n 10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you a spirit of deep\nsleep, and bath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads,\nthe seers, hath he covered. \n 11 And the vision of it all is become unto you as the words\nof the sealed writing, which they give \u2019 to one that knoweth\nwriting, saying, Read this, pray: and he saith, I cannot, for it\nis sealed. \n 12 And the writing is given unto one that knoweth not writing,\nsaying, Read this, pray; and he saith, I know not writing. \n 13 And the Lord said, F orasmuch as this people draweth\nnear, honoureth me with its mouth and with its lips; and hath\nremoved its heart away from me; and their fear of me is a precept\nof men, that is taught: \n 14 Therefore, behold, I am he that will again deal wonderquy\nwith this people, wonderfully and a wonder; and the wisdom of\nits wise men shall perish, andthe discernment of its discerning\nmen shall hide itself. \n 15 Ah, they that go deep from the Lord to hide counsel\nand their-works are in darkness, and they say, Who seeth us?\nand Who knoweth us? \n 16 The perverseness of you! shall the potter be reckoned as\nclay? that the thing made should say of him that made it, He\nmade me not! and the thing formed of him that formed it,\n\u2019 discerneth not! \n 17 Is it not yet but a very little while, and Lebanon shall\nturn to garden-land, and the garden-land be reckoned as a\nforest? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 Faint ye, and fall away, and stagger drunkenly, not with\nstrong drink, nor with wine. \n 10 For the Lord hath given you to drink with a spirit of\nslumber, and will close their eyes, and their \u2019 and their\n\u2019 eyes; they it is that see the hidden things. \n 11 And all these words shall be as the sayings of this book\nthat is sealed, and if they give it to a man that knoweth letters,\nsaying, Read these; then he shall say, I cannot read, for it is sealed. \n 12 And this book shall be given into the hands of a man such\nas knoweth not letters, and one shall say to him, Read this; and\nhe shall say, I know not letters. \n 13 And the Lord said, This people draweth near me, with\ntheir lips they honour me, but their heart is far from me; but in\nvain do they worship me, teaching the commandments of men,\nand doctrines. \n 14 Therefore behold, I will proceed further to change this\npeople; and I will change them, and will destroy the wisdom of\nthe wise, and the prudence of the prudent will I hide. \n 15 Ah, they that take counsel deeply, and not through the\nLord; ah, they that take counsel in secret, and their works shall\nbe in darkness, and they shall say, Who hath seen us? and who\nshall \ufb01nd us out, or what we do? \n 16 Shall ye not be reckoned as the \u2019s clay? Shall the\nthing formed say to him that formed (it), Thou didst not form\n\u2019 or the thing made to him that made it, Thou didst not\nmake me with understanding? \n 17 Is it not yet a little while, and Lebanon shall be changed\n(to be) as mount Carmel, and mount Carmel shall be reckoned\n\u2019 for a forest? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a writing,\nand the eyes of the blind shall see out of gloom and out of\ndarkness. \n 19 And the meek shall add to their. joy in the LORD, and the\npoor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel. \n 20 For the terrible one is at an end, and all is overylwith the\nscoffer, and that watched for iniquity are cut off . \n 21 That make a man offend by a word, and lay a snare for\nhim that convinceth in the gate; and turn aside the righteous\nwith emptiness. \n 22 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the house of\nJacob, he that redeemed Abraham 3 Not now shall Jacob be\nashamed, neither shall his face now be pale. \n 23 For when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in\nthe midst of him, they shall count my name holy, and countholy\nthe Holy One of Jacob, and fear the God of Israel. \n 24 And they that err in spirit shall learn discernment, and they\nthat murmur shall receive instruction. \n XXX. 1 Ah, the rebellious sons, saith the LORD, that take\ncounsel, and not of me ; and weave a web, and not with my spirit,\nthat they may add sin to sin \n 2 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my\nmouth; to strengthen themselves in the stronghold of Pharaoh,\nand to trust in the shadow of Egypt. \n 3 Therefore shall the stronghold of. Pharaoh be to yOu a shame, I\nand the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a book,\nand they that are in the darkness, and that are in the mist, the\neyes of the blind shall see. \n 19 And the poor shall exult because of the Lord, and they\nthat were despaired for among men shall be \ufb01lled with joy. \n 20 The transgressor hath failed, and the overweening man is\nperished, and they that transgressed for evil doing are utterly\ndestroyed, \n 21 And they that cause men to err in a word; and all them\nthat convince in the gates shall they set as a stuniblingblock, and\n. they turned aside the just among the unjust. \n 22 Therefore thus saith the Lord upon the house of Jacob,\nwhich he separated from (among) Abraham, Jacob shall not now\n. be ashamed, nor Israel now change his face: \n 23 But when they see their children, my works, they shall\nsanctify my name because of me, and sanctify the Holy One of\nJacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. \n 24 And, they that wander in spirit shall learn prudence, but\nthey that murmur shall learn to hearken, and the stammering\ntongue shall learn to speak peace. \n XXX. 1 Ah, rebel children, thus saith the Lord: ye took\ncounsel, and not through me, and made agreements, not through\nmy spirit, to add sins upon sins: \n 2 They that walk to go down into Egypt, but they asked not\nme; that they might be helped by Pharaoh, and sheltered by the\nEgyptians. \n 3 For Pharaoh shall be your shelter to your shame, and to\n\u0387 them that trust in Egypt a reproach. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 For his princes are at Zoan, and his messengers have reached\nHanes. \n 5 All shall be. ashamed of a people \u0387 shall not profit\nthem, not for a help nor profit, but for a shame, and also a\nreproach. \n 6 The burden of the beasts of the south country.\nThrough a land of distress and anguish, whence are the lioness\nand lion, viper and \ufb02ying \ufb01ery serpent, they carry their riches\non the shoulder of young asses, and their treasures upon the\nbunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit \n 7 And Egypt, vain and empty will be their help: therefore\nI cry concerning this, Rahab are they, a sitting still. \n 8 Now go, write it on a tablet before them, and inscribe it in\na book, and let it be for an after day, for ever and ever: \n 9 For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons that will not\nhear the law of the LORD: \n 10 Which say to the seers, Ye shall not see, and to them that\nhave vision, Have visions not of right things, speak unto us\nsmooth things, see delusive visions. \n 11 Remove you out of the way, turn aside out of the path;\nmake to cease from before us the Holy One of Israel. \n 12 Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because ye\nreject this word, and trust in oppression and crookedness, and\nstay thereon; \n 13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as afalling breach,\nswelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometb suddenly,\nin a moment. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 For there are in Tanis Chieftains, evil messengers: \n 5 In vain shall they weary themselves with a people that shall\nnot profit them, neither for help nor for profit, but for shame\nand reproach. \n 6 The vision of the fourfooted beasts that are in the wilderness.\nAmid the affliction and the straitening, a lion, and a lion's\nwhelp: thence also serpents, and the offspring of \ufb02ying serpents;\nmen who brought their wealth upon asses and camels to a\nnation which shall not profit them [for help, but for shame and\nreproach]. \n 7 The Egyptians will profit you in vain and emptily; declare\nto them, This your consolation is vain. \n 8 Now therefore sit and write this upon a tablet, and in\na book, that these things shallbe for days of times and even\nfor ever. \n 9 For it is a disobedient people, lying sons, who were not\nwilling to hear the law of God, \n 10 They which say unto the prophets, Declare not unto us,\nand to them that see visions, Talk not unto.us...but talk to us\nand declare unto us another beguiling, \n 11 And turn us away from this way; take away from us this\npath, and take away from us the oracle of Israel. \n 12 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel,\nBecause ye were disobedient to these words, and hoped in\na lie, and because thou didst murmur, and trusted in this\nwor \n 13 Therefore this sin \u2019shall be to you like a suddenly falling\nwall of a city that hath been taken, whereof the ruin cometh\nsuddenly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 And he shall break it as a \u2019s jar is broken, shivering\nit unsparingly; and there shall not be found a sherd among the\nshivered fragments thereof, to take fire. from the hearth, or to draw\nwater from a cistern. \n 15 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In\nreturning and rest shall ye be saved: in quietness and in confidence\nshall be your strength; and ye were unwilling. \n 16 And ye said, No: for we will flee upon horses; therefore\nshall ye flee; and. We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall\nthey that pursue you be swift. \n 17 one thousand from before the rebuke of one, before the\nrebuke of \ufb01ve shall ye \ufb02ee, till ye be left as a mast upon the top\nof a mountain, and like the ensign on the hill. \n 18 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious\nunto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have\nmercy upon you ; for the LORD is a God of judgment; happy are\nall that wait for him. \n 19 For a people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thdu shalt\nweep no mOre; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice\nof thy cry ; as he heareth it, he answereth thee. \n 20 And the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction, and\nwater of oppression; and thy teachers shall not withdraw any\nmore, and thine eyes shall see thy teachers: \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 And the ruin of it shall be as the breaking of an earthen\nvessel, a small piece of a jar, so that one cannot \ufb01nd among\nthem a sherd wherein thou canst take up \ufb01re, or wherein thou\ncanst <take away> canst a little water. \n 15 Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, When thou\nshalt turn and lament, then shalt thou be saved, and learn where\nthou wast (placed): when thou hadst thy trust in vanities, your\nstrength became vain: and ye would not hear. \n 16, But \u2019. said, We will \ufb02ee upon horses; therefore shall ye\n\ufb02ee: and ye said, We will be mounted on swift (ones); therefore\nshall they that pursue you be swift. \n 17 And a thousand shall \ufb02ee because of the voice of one: and\nbecause of the voice of \ufb01ve shall many \ufb02ee; until ye be left as\na mast upon a mountain, and as (one) bearing a standard upon\na hill. \n 18 And again will God wait, that he may pity you, and for this\ncause will he be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, because\nthe Lord your God is a judge; and where will ye leave your\nglory? Blessed are all they that wait upon him. \n 19 For a holy people shall dwell in Zion; and Jerusalem\nwept sore, Have mercy on me: and he will have mercy on the\nvoice of thy cry ; when he saw, he hearkened unto thee. \n 20 And the Lord shall give to you bread of affliction, and\n\u2019 \u2019 scant water; and no longer shall they that beguile thee draw near\nto thee; for thine eyes shall see them that beguile thee, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This\nis the way, walk ye in it: when ye turn to the right hand, and\nwhen ye turn to the left. \n 22 And ye shall defile the covering of thy graven images of\nsilver, and the overlaying of thy molten images of gold; thou\nshalt scatter them as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it,\nBegone! \n 23 And he shall give. the rain of thy seed, with which thou\nshalt sow the ground; and bread, the increase of the ground, and\n- it shall be rich and fat: in that day shall thy cattle feed in a\nbroad pasture. \n 24 And the oxen and. the young asses that till the ground shall\neat salted provender, winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. \n 25 And there shall be, upon every high mountain, and on\nevery uplifted hill, channels and streams of waters in the day of\nthe great slaughter when the towers fall. \n 26 And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,\nand the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven\ndays, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the hurt of his people,\nand healeth the stroke of its wound. \n 27 Behold, the Name of the LORD cometh from far; burning\nhis anger, and denseness of rising smoke; his lips are full of\nindignation, and his tongue like devouring \ufb01re. \n 28 And his breath is as an overflowing stream, dividing even\nto the neck, to shake the nations in the shaking sieve of vanity;\nand a bridle that leadeth astray shall be in the jaws of peoples. \n 29 Your song shall be like the night When a feast is kept holy;\nand joy of heart, like his that marcheth with the \ufb02ute, to go into\nthe mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. \n \n \n\n \n 21 And thine ears shall hear the words of the beguilers behind\nthee; it is they who say, This is the way, let us walk in it, whether\nto the right hand or to the left. \n 22 And thou shalt remove the idols, overlaid with silver and\nwith gold; thou shalt make them small, and shalt scatter them\naway as the water of her that sitteth apart, and as dung shalt thou\nremove them. \n 23 Then shall the rain be upon the seed of thy land, and the\nbread of the increase of thy land shall be plenteousness, and shall\nbe fat; and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a rich place and a\nlarge. \n 24 Your bulls, and your oxen that plough the land, shall eat\nbran prepared for them winnowed with barley. \n 25 And there shall be, upon every high mountain, and upon\nevery lofty hill, \ufb02owing water in that day, when many perish, and\nwhen towers fall. \n 26 And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,\nand the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, in the day when the\nLord healeth the breaking of his \u2019peOple, and shall heal the pain\nof thy wound. \n 27 Behold, the name of the Lord cometh after long time,\nburning is his wrath; with glory is the oracle of his lips, his\noracle is full of wrath, and the wrath of his anger shall devour like\nfire \n 28 And his breath, like water sweeping in a torrent-bed, shall\ncome even to the neck, and shall be divided, to confuse nations,\nin vain error; and vain error shall pursue them, and shall lay\nhold on them, face to face. \n 29 Ought ye to rejoice continually, and to enter continually\ninto my holy places as though feasting, and to. enter in as though\nin joy, with the pipe, into the house of the Lord, to the God of\nIsrael? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 30 And the Lord shall cause the majesty of his voice to be\nheard, and the lighting down of his arm to be seen, with fury of\nanger, and \ufb02ame of devouring \ufb01re; scattering, rainstorm, and\nhailstone. . \u2019 \n 31 For at the voice of the Lord shall Asshur be affrighted ;\nwith the rod shall he smite. \n 32 every passing of the staff of destiny, which the Lord\nshall make to light on him, shall be with tabrets and harps; and\nwith waving wars shall he \ufb01ght against her. \u2019 \n 33 For a burning place is made ready from yesterday; even it\nis prepared for the king; he hath made it deep, and hath made\nit broad; its pile \ufb01re and much wood; the breath of the Lord,\nlike a stream of brimstone, bumeth against it. \n XXXI. 1 Ah, they that go down to Egypt for help; and.\nthey stay on horses, and trust in chariots, for they are many, and in\nhorsemen, for they are very strong; and they look not unto the\nHoly One of Israel, neither. inquire of the Lord! \n 2 And he also is wise; and bringeth evil, and removeth not his\nwords; and he riseth up against the house of evil doers, and\nagainst the help of them that work naughtiness. \n 3 And the Egyptians are men, and not God: and their horses\n\ufb02esh, and not spirit: and the Lord shall stretch out his hand, and\nhe that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is holpen shall fall, and\nthey all shall come to an end together. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 30 And God shall make the glory of his voice heard, even to\nshow the wrath of his arm with wrath and anger and devouring\n\ufb02ame, he shall thunder violently (upon them), and like water and\nhail descending with violence. \n 31 For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrians be\nvanquished, with the wound wherewithsoever he smiteth them.. \n 32 And it shall be unto him round about, whence was his hope\nof help, wherein he himself trusted; they, with tabrets and harp,\nshall turn and make war upon him. \n 33 For thou shalt not be deceived Before the days: was it also\nprepared for thee to reign? a deep trench, layers of wood, \ufb01re\nand much wood? the wrath of the Lord is as a trench burning\nwith brimstone. \n XXXI. 1 Ah, they that go down into Egypt for help; that\ntrust in horses and in chariots, for they are many, and in horses,\nthey are a great multitude; and trusted not in the Holy One of\n\u2019Israel, and sought not God. \n 2 And,. wise himself, he brought evils upon them; and his word\nshall not be set at nought; and he shall rise up against the houses\nof wicked men, and against their vain hope, \n 3 An Egyptian, a man, and not a god: the \ufb02esh of. horses, and\n\u2019 there is no help (in them); but the Lord shall set his hand against\nthem, and they that (come to) help shall weary themselves, and all\nshall perish together. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 For thus said the LORD unto me, As the lion growleth, and\nthe young lion over his prey, against whom a multitude of\n\u2019 shepherds is called forth: at their voice he is not affrighted, and\nat their uproar he is not dismayed; so shall the LORD of Hosts\ncome down to \ufb01ght against mount Zion, and against the hill\nthereof. \n 5 As birds hovering, so will the LORD of Hosts protect Jeru-\nsalem; protecting and rescuing, passing over, and setting free. \n 6 Return ye unto him from whom they have deeply revolted,\n\u039f children of Israel. \n 7 For in that day they shall reject every man his false gods of\nsilver, and his false gods of gold, which your own hands have\nmade you, a sin. \n 8 And Asshur shall fall, by the sword of no man, and the\nsword, of none born of men, shall devour him; and he shall \ufb02ee\nfrom before the sword, and his young men shall be for tribute. \n 9 And his rock shall pass away, from fear, and his princes be\nfrighted from the standard, saith the LORD, who hath his \ufb01re in.\nZion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. \u2019 \n XXXII. 1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and\n(as) for princes, they shall rule in judgment. \n 2 And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a\ncovert from the rainstorm; as channels of water in a dry place,\nas the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. \n 3 And the eyes of them that see shall not be closed, and the\nears of them that hear shall hearken. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 For thus saith the Lord to me, Like as if the lion or the\nwhelp crieth out over the prey, which he hath taken, and roareth\nover it until the mountains be filled with his voice; and they were\nvanquished, and cowered before the greatness of his wrath; so\nshall the Lord of Hosts come down to \ufb01ght against the mount\nZion, and against her mountains. \n \u2019 5 As birds \ufb02ying, so will the Lord hold a shield to defend\nJerusalem, and will deliver it, and preserve it, and will save it. \n 6 Turn you, ye that counsel the deep counsel, and the\ndisobedient; \n 7 For in that day shall men disown the works of their hands,\nthose of silver, and those of gold, which their hands have made. \n 8 And Asshur shall fall; not the sword of a man, nor the\nsword of mankind, shall him; and he shall \ufb02ee, not from\nbefore a pursuer; but the young men shall be vaniluished. \n 9 For they shall be encompassed by a rock, as with a palisade,\nand shall be vanquished, and he that \ufb02eeth shall be taken.\nThus saith the Lord, Happy is he who hath a seed in Zion, and\nkinsmen in Jerusalem. \n XXXII. 1 For behold, a just king shall reign, and rulers\nshall rule with judgment. \n 2 And the man shall be, hiding these sayings, and he shall be\nhidden as from rushing water; and he shall appear in Zion as a\nrushing river, glorious in a thirsting land. \n 3 And no longer shall they put their trust in men, but they\nshall lend \u2019ears to hear. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 And the heart of the hasty shall have discernment to know,\nand the tongue of the stammerers shall be quick to speak\nclearly. \u0387 \n 5 The fool shall no more be called noble, nor the mean spoken\nof as liberal. \n 6 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work naughtiness,\ntodo impiety, and to speak error against the Lord, to empty\nthe soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty\nto fail. \n 7 And the means of the mean are evil; it is he that deviseth\nplots to destroy the meek with words of falsehood, even when the\nneedy speaketh judgment. \n 8 But the noble deviseth noble things; and he shall stand\n\ufb01rm on noble things. \n 9 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice: ye\ncon\ufb01dent daughters, give ear unto my speech. \n 10 In a year, and days over, shall ye be disquieted, ye con\ufb01dent\nOnes ; for the vintage is at an end, the gathering shall not come. \n 11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease: be disquieted, ye\ncon\ufb01dent ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird (sackcloth)\nupon your loins. \n 12 They shall smite upon the breasts, for the pleasant \ufb01elds,\nfor the fruitful vine. \n 13 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and\nbriers ; yea, upon all houses of joy the exultant city. \n 14 For the palace is forsaken: the uproar of the city deserted;\nhill and watchtower serve for caves for ever, a joy of wild asses,\na pasture of \ufb02ocks: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 4 And the heart of the weak ones shall attend to hear, and the\n\u2019mering tongues shall soon learn to speak peace. \n 5 And no longer shall they bid the fool to rule, and no longer\nshall thy servants say, Hold thy peace. \n 6 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will imagine vain\nthings, to fulfil transgressions, and to utter error against the Lord,\nto scatter hungry souls abroad, and to make empty the souls that\nthirst. \n 7 For the counsel of the wicked doth counsel transgressions,\nto destroy the humble with unjust words, and to scatter the\nreasonings of the humble in judgment. \n 8 But the godly counselled prudent things, and this counsel\nshall abide. \n 9 Ye wealthy women, stand up, and hear my voice; ye\ndaughters in hope, hearken to my words. \n 10 For the days of a year call to remembrance in pain, with\nhope; the vintage is consumed, the sowing is ceased, and shall no\nlonger come. \n 11 Be astonished, be grieved, ye confindent women; strip\nyourselves, \u2019bare, gird sackcloth upon your loins. \n 12 And smite yourselves upon the breasts, for a \ufb01eld of desire,\nand the fruit of the vine. \n 13 The land of my people, the thorn and grass shall come\nup, and joy shall be removed from every dwelling. A wealthy\ncity, \n 14 Desolate houses: they shall abandon the wealthiof a city,\nand desirable houses; and the villages shall be caverns for ever,\na joy of wild asses, feeding places of shepherds, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 Until a spirit be poured out upon us from on high, and the\nwilderness become a garden-land, and the garden-land be counted\nfor a forest. \n 16 And judgment shall rest in the wilderness, and righteousness.\ndwell in the garden-land. - \n 17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the\neffect of righteousness quietness and con\ufb01dence for ever. \n 18 And my people shall abide in a home of peace, and in\nsecure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places. \n 19 And it shall hail at the downfall of the forest; and the city\nshall lie low in lowliness. \n 20 Happy are ye, that sow beside all waters; that send forth\nthe foot of the ox and the ass. \n XXXIII. 1 Ah, thou that spoilest, and thyself art not\nspoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they have not dealt\ntreacherously with thee! When thou shalt cease to spoil, thou\nshalt be spoiled; when thou shalt have succeeded in dealing\ntreacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. \n 2 O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited fOr thee; be\nthou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of\ntrouble. \n 3 At the voice of the uproar the\u2019peoples \ufb02ee; at the lifting up\nof thyself the nations are scattered. \n 4 And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth;\nas locusts run to and fro, shall they run upon it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 Until there come upon you a spirit from on high. And\nCarmel shall be. desolate, and Carmel shall be reckoned as a\nforest. \n 16 And judgment shall rest in the wilderness, and righteousness\nshall dwell in Carmel. \n 17 And the works of righteousness shall be peace, and right-\neousness shall obtain rest, and they shall be confident ones for\never. \n 18 And his people-shall dwell in a city of peace, and shall\ndwell in confidence, and they shall rest amid wealth. \n 19 And the hail, if it descend, shall not come upon you. And\nthey that dwell in the forests shall be confident, as they in the\nplain. \n 20 Blessed are they that sow upon every water, where ox and\nass treadeth. \n XXXIII. 1 Ah, for them that ill-treat you, but you none\nill-treateth; and he that setteth at nought setteth not you at\nnought; they that set at nought shall be taken and shall be\ndelivered up; and like a moth upon a garment, so shall they be i\ncrushed. \n 2 O Lord, have mercy us, for in thee do we trust; the\n\u2019seed of the disobedient hath fallen into destruction, but our\nsalvation is in a time of affliction. \n 3 Because of the voice of the fear of thee, peoples shrank\naway, from the fear of thee, and the nations were scattered. \n 4 But now shall your spoils, from small and great, be gathered\ntogether; like as if one gathereth locusts, so shall they make sport\nupon you. \u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 The LORD is exalted, for he dwelleth in the height; he hath\n\ufb01lled Zion with judgment and righteousness. \n 6 And there shall be faithfulness in thy times; power of\nsalvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord, that\nis his treasure. \u2019 \n 7 Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the mesSengers of\npeace weep bitterly. \n 8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man is ceased; he\nhath broken the covenant, despised cities, not man. \n 9 The earth mourneth, languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed,\nwithereth; Sharon becometh like a desert; and Bashan and\nCarmel shake off (their leaves). \n 10 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I exalt myself;\nnow will I lift up myself. \n 11 Ye shall conceive hay, ye shall bring forth stubble; your\nbreath is \ufb01re which shall devour you. \n 12 And peoples shall become burnings of lime; thorns cut up,\nthey shall burn in the \ufb01re. \n 13 Hear, ye that are far, what I have done; and ye that are\nnear, acknowledge my might. \n 14 The sinners are afraid in Zion; trembling hath seized the\nimpious. Who among us can sojourn with deVOuring \ufb01re? who\namong us can sojourn with everlasting burnings? \n 15 He that walketh in righteousness, and speaketh upright-\nness; that rejecteth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his\nhands from taking hold on a bribe, that stoppeth his ear from\nhearing of bloodshed, and closeth his eyes from seeing evil: \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Holy is God that dwelleth on high; Zion is \ufb01lled with judg-\nment, and with righteousness. \n 6 By a law shall they be delivered up; in treasures is your\nsalvation; therein is wisdom and knowledge, and reverence\ntowards the Lord; these are the treasures of righteousness. \n 7 Behold now, in your fear shall they be afraid; they whom\nye feared shall be afraid because of you; for messengers shall be\nsent, claiming peace, weeping bitterly, entreating for peace. \n 8 For their paths shall be made desolate; for the fear of the\nnations is ceased, and their covenant with these is removed, and\n\u2019ye shall not reckon them as men. \n 9 The earth mourneth, Lebanon is ashamed, Sharon becometh\nmarshes; Galilee shall be made manifest, and Carmel. \n 10 Now will I rise up, saith the Lord, now will I be glorified\nnow will I be uplifted. \n 11 Now shall ye see, now shall ye be ashamed; vain shall be\nthe strength of your spirit, \ufb01re shall devour you. \n 12 And the nations shall be burnt up, as a thorn cast upon a\n\ufb01eld and burnt up. \n 13 They that are from afar off shall hear what I have done;\nthey that draw near shall learn my strength. \n 14 The transgressors in Zion have stood aloof: trembling shall\ntake hold of the ungodly. Who shall declare unto you that a \ufb01re\nis burning? who shall declare unto you the place that is for ever? \n 15 One that walketh in righteousness, speaking in a straight\nway, hating transgression and wrong doing, and shaking off his\nhands from gifts; that maketh his ears dull, that he may not hear\na judgment of blood; that closeth his eyes, that he may not see\nwrongdoing, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 16 He shall inhabit heights, fortresses of rocks (are) his high\nplace; his bread is given him, his water is sure. \n 17 Thine eyes shall see a king in his beauty; they shall\nbehold a land of distances. \n 18 Thine heart shall meditate on terror. Where is he that\ncounted? Where he that weighed? where he that counted the\ntowers? \n 19 Thou shalt not see the stubborn people, a people too deep\nof language to be heard; of a stammering tongue, there is no\ndiscerning. \n 20 Look upon. Zion, the city of our appointed assembly;\nthine eyes shall see Jerusalem a habitation of security, a tent\nthat shall not be removed; its stakes shall not be plucked up\nfor ever, and all its cords are unbroken. \n 21 But there in majesty the Lord will be for us a place of\nrivers, of canals wide stretching; thereon shall go no galley with\noars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. \n 22 For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the\nLord is our king: he will save us. \n 23 Thy cords are loosed, they cannot \ufb01rmly \ufb01x their pole;\nthey have not spread out the banner; then was divided the prey\nof plunder in abundance; lame men do spoil spoil. \n 24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people\nthat dwelleth therein is forgiven (its) iniquity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 16 He shall dwell in a. lofty cavern of a strong rock; bread\nshall be given unto him, and his water (is) sure. \n 17 Ye shall see a king with glory, and your eyes shall behold\na land from afar off. \n 18 Your soul shall meditate on the fear of the Lord; where\nare the scribes? where are the counsellors? where is he that\ncounted them that were nourished up together, \n 19 A small and a great people? with whom they took not\ncounsel, neither understood he their deep speech: \n 20 Behold Zion our city, our salvation; thine eyes shall see\nJerusalem, it is a wealthy city, tents which shall not be shaken,\n\u2019 nor shall the stakes of the tent thereof be disturbed for ever, nor\nits cords broken: \n 21 For the name of the Lord is great. Ye shall have a place,\nrivers and canals, wide and spacious; thou shalt not go by this\nway, neither shall a ship go driving along. \n 22 For my God is great; he will not pass me by; the Lord is\nour judge, the Lord is our ruler, the Lord is our king; the Lord,\nhe shall save us. \n 23 Thy cords are broken, for they were not strong; thy mast\nhath bent, it will not loosen the sails, it will not lift Up a signal,\nuntil it be given up for plunder; therefore shall many lame take\nplunder. \n 24 And the people that dwelleth among them shall not say,\nI am faint; for their sin is forgiven. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XXXIV. 1 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken,\nye peoples; let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world,\nand all that come forth of it. \n 2 For the LORD hath indignation against all nations, and fury\nagainst all their host; he hath laid them under the ban, he hath\ngiven them to slaughter. \n 3 And their smitten shall be cast out, and their carcases, their\nstink shall go up, and mountains shall be melted with their\nblood. \n 4 And all the host of heaven shall waste away, and the heavens\nshall be rolled up as a scroll, and all their host shall fade, as a\nleaf fadeth from a vine, and as a fading (leaf) from a \ufb01g tree. \n 5 For my sword hath drenched itself in heaven; behold, it\nshall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my ban,\nfor judgment. \n 6 The LORD hath a sword, it is \ufb01lled with blood, it is made\nrich with fat, with the blood of lambs and he goats, with the fat of\nthe kidneys of rams; for the \u2019LORD bath a sacrifice in Bozrah,\nand a great slaughter \u2019the land of Edom. \n 7 And \u2019 oxen shall come down with them, and bullocks\nwith bulls; and their land shall be drenched with blood, and\ntheir dust made rich with fat. \n 8 For the Lord hatha day of vengeance, and a year of recompense\nfor the quarrel of Zion. \n 9 And her streams shall be turned into pitch, and her dust\ninto brimstone; and the land thereof shall become pitch that\nburneth. \n 10 Night and day it shall not be quenched; for ever its smoke\nshall go up; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; for\never and ever there shall be none passing through it. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XXXIV. 1 Draw near, ye nations, and hearken, ye rulers;\nlet the earth hear, and they that dwell therein, the world, and the\npeople that is in it. \n 2 For the wrath, of the Lord is against all the nations, and\nanger against the muster of them; to destroy them, and to give\nthem over to slaughter. \n 3 And their wounded shall be cast forth, and their dead, and\ntheir stink shall go up, and the mountains shall be wet with their\nblood. \n 4 And the heaven shall be rolled up like a book, and all the\nstars shall fall like leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a\n\ufb01g tree. \n 5 My sword is drunken in the heaven; behold, it shall\ndescend upon Idumaea, and upon the people of perdition with\njudgment. \n 6 The sword of the Lord is \ufb01lled with blood, it is enriched\nwith fatness, and with the fat of goats and rams. For there is a\nsacrifice to the Lord in the land of Bozrah, and a great slaughter\nin Idumaea. \n 7 And the chief ones shall fall with them, and the rams and\nthe bulls; and the earth shall be drunken with the blood, and\nshall be \ufb01lled with the fat of them. \n 8 For it is the day of the judgment of the Lord, and the year\nof the recompense of the judgment of Zion. \n 9 And the torrents thereof shall be turned into pitch, and\nher land into brimstone; and her land shall be burning like\npitch, \n 10 By night and day; and shall not be quenched for ever; and\nthe smoke thereof shall ascend upward, it shall be desolated for\ngenerations. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it; and the\nhorned owl and the raven shall dwell in it; and he shall stretch\nout upon it the line of wasteness and the plummet of void. \n 12 As for the nobles thereof, none shall be there to proclaim\nthe kingdom ; and all her princes shall be no more. \n 13 And her castles shall spring up (with) thorns; nettles and\nbrambles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation\nfor jackals, a court for [daughters of ] ostriches. \n 14 And desert creatures shall meet the wolves, and the shaggy\nbeast shall call to his fellow; the screech owl surely shall repose\nthere, and \ufb01nd for herself a resting-place. \n 15 There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, and\nhatch, and gather in her shadow; there surely shall the kites be ,\nbrought together, each with her mate. \n 16 Inquire ye out of the book of the Lord, and read; none\nof these is missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth,\nit hath commanded, and his spirit, it hath brought them\ntogether. \n 17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath\ndivided it unto them by line; they shall possess it for ever, to\ngeneration and generation shall they dwell therein. \n XXXV. 1 The wilderness and the dry place shall rejoice;\nand the desert shall exult, and blossom like the narcissus. \n 2 It shall. blossom abundantly and exult, yea with exultation.\nand singing; there shall be given to it the glory of Lebanon, the\nhonour of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of the\nLord, the honour of our God. \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And birds, and hedgehogs, and ibises, and ravens shall\ndwell therein; and there shall be cast over it the measuring line\nof desolation, \u2019satyrs shall dwell therein. \n 12 Her rulers shall not be; for her kings and her rulers and\nher great ones shall come to destruction. \n 13 And the thorn shall grow up upon her cities and upon her\nstrongholds: and it shall be lurking places for owls and a court of\nostriches. \n 14 And demons shall meet with satyrs, and shall call one\nto another; there shall satyrs rest, for they have found them a\nresting-place. \n 15 There doth the hedgehog nest, and the earth keepeth her\nyoung in safety; there do the hinds meet, and see one \u2019s\nfaces:. \n 16 By number come they, and not one of them perisheth;\nnone seeketh another; for the Lord hath commanded them, and\nhis spirit hath brought them together. \n 17 And he himself shall cast lots for them, and his hand\ndivideth (for them) to feed; inherit it for ever; forgenerations of.\n\u2019 generations shall they rest thereon. \n XXXV. 1 Be thou glad, O thirsting desert; let the wilder-\nness rejoice, and blossom as a lily; \n 2 And the desolate places of Jordan shall blossom and rejoice:\nand the glory of Lebanon is given unto it, and the honour of\nCarmel; and my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the\nexaltation of God. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 Strengthen ye the slack hands, and confirm the stumbling,\nknees. \n 4 Say to the hasty of heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your\nGod, vengeance cometh, retribution of God; himself cometh, and\nwill save you. \n 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of\nthe deaf shall be unstopped: \n 6 Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of\nthe dumb sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and\nstreams in the desert. \n 7 And the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty\nland springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, their lair, a\ncourt for reed and rush. \n 8 And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be\ncalled the holy way; there shall not pass over it (any) unclean;\nand his for them; and whosoever walketh in the way, and fools,\nshall not go astray. \n 9 No lion shall be there, nor shall the (most) violent of beasts\ngo up thereon; it shall not be found there; and redeemed ones\nshall walk (there), \n 10 And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to\nZion with song, and everlasting joy upon their head 3 they shall\nattain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall \ufb02ee away. \n XXXVI. 1 And it came to pass, in the fourteenth year of\nthe king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against\nall the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. \n 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to\nJerusalem to the king Hezekiah with a great army. And he took\nhis stand by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the\nfuller's \ufb01eld. \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 Be strong, ye slackened hands, and feeble knees: \n 4 Give comfort, ye faint hearted; be strong, fear not; behold,\nour God will give a recompense of judgment, yea, will give; he\nhimself will come and save us. \n 5 Then shall the eyes of the blind men be Opened, and the\nears of deaf men shall bear. \n 6 Then shall a lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of\nstammerers shall be clear, for there hath broken out water in the\nwilderness, and a torrent in a thirsting land. \n 7 And the waterless land shall become pools, and into the;\nthirsting land shall come a fount of water; there shall be joy of\nbirds, beds of reed and pools. \n 8 A pure way shall be there, and it shall be called a holy way,\nand (no unclean person shall pass by there, neither shall an\nunclean way be there; but the dispersed shall walk upon it, and\nthey shall not err. \n 9 And no lion shall be there, nor shall any of the evil beasts\ngloetrignthereon, nor be found there; but ransomed shall walk\ntherein, \n 10 And (those) gathered together because of the Lord; they\nshall return, and come to Zion with joy, and everlasting joy upon\ntheir head; for on their head (shall be) praise and triumph, and\njoy shall take hold upon them; fled away is pain, and grief, and\nsighing. \n XXXVI. 1 And it came to pass, in the fourteenth year of\nthe reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came\nup against the cities of Judah, that were strong, and took them. \n 2 And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabshakeh from Lachish\nto Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah, with a great power; and he stood\nin the watercourse of the upper pool, in the way of the fuller's\n\ufb01eld. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 And there went out to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which\nwas over the house, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah, Asaph's\nson, the recorder; \n 4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say, I pray, to Hezekiah,\nThus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What trust is this\nwherewith thou trustest? \n 5 I say, It is only a word of -the lips, counsel and strength for\nwar: now, in whom trustest thou, that thou rebellest against me? \n 6 Lo, thou trustest on this bruised reed, on Egypt; whereon if\na man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh\n\u2019of Egypt to all that trust in him. \n 7 And if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it\nnot he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath\nremoved, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship\nbefore this altar? \n 8 And now, exchange pledges, I pray, with my lord the king of\nAssyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able\nto set for thyself riders upon them. \n 9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one governor\namong the least of my \u2019s servants, and puttest thy trust in\n- Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? \n 10 And now is it without the LORD that I am come up against\nthis land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against\nthis land, and destroy it. \n 11 And Eliakim said, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh,\nSpeak, pray, unto thy servants in the Aramaean tongue, for we\nunderstand it: and speak not unto us in the Jewish tongue, in-the\nears of the people which are on the wall. \n 12 And Rabshakeh said, Is it to thy lord, and to thee, that my\nlord hath sent me, to speak these words? Is it not to the men\nthat sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and drink their own\nwater with you? \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the steward, went out to\nhim, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the\nrecorder. \n 4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye to Hezekiah, Thus\nsaith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: why trustest thou? \n 5 Cometh there battle array in counsel, or in words of the\nlips? and now in whom dost thou trust, that thou resistest me? \n 6 Behold, thy trust is on this staff of reed, that is broken, upon\n- Egypt: whosoever leaneth upon it, it will go into his hand; so is\nPharaoh king of Egypt, and all they that trust in him. \n 7 But if ye say, We trust in the Lord our God: \n 8 Now join ye with my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and\nI will give you two thousand horses, if ye shall be able to furnish\nmen (to ride) upon them. \n 9 How, pray, can ye turn back the face of one governor?\nthey are slaves \u2019 trust in the Egyptians, for horse and for\nhorseman. \n 10 And now, are we come up without the Lord against this\nland, to war against it? \n 11 And Eliakim said unto him, and Shebna the scribe, and\nJoah, Speak unto thy servants in the Syrian tongue, for we understand\n(it); and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue; and why\nspeakest thou in the ears of the men that sit upon the wall? \n 12. And Rabshakeh said to them, Hath my lord sent me to\nyour lord, or to you, to speak these words; is it not to the men\nthat sit on the wall, that they may eat dung and drink (their own)\nwater with you together? \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 And Rabshakeh Stood, and cried with a great voice in the\nJewish tongue, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the \u1f26\nking of AsSyria \n 14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he\nshall not be able to deliver you. \u1f41 . \n 15 And let not Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying,\nThe LORD will safely deliver us; this city shall not be given into\nthe hand of the king of Assyria. \u2019 \n 16 Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of\nAssyria., Make agreement with me, and come \u2019out to me; and eat\nye everyone of his vine, and everyone of his \ufb01g tree, and drink\nye everyone the waters of his cistern : \n 17 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own -\nland, a land of corn and new wine, a land, of bread and vine-\nyards: \n 18 Lest Hezekiah entice you, saying, The LORD will deliver\nus. Have the gods of the nations delivered everyone his land\nout of the hand of the king of Assyria? \n 19 Where are the gods-of Hamath and Arpad? where the \u2019\ngods of Sepharvaim? and verily they have delivered Samaria out\n\u2019 of my hand! . \n 20 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have\n\u2019 delivered their land out of my hand? that the LORD should\ndeliver Jerusalem out of my hand! \n 21 But they \u2019held their peace, arid answered him not a word;\nfor the king\u2019s commandment was thus, saying, Ye shall not answer \u2019\nhim. \u2019 \n 22 And Eliakim came, the son of Hilkiah, that\u2019was over the\nhouse, and Shebna the secretary, and J-oah, the son of Asaph,\nthe recorder, unto Hezekiah, with clothes rent, and told him the \u2019\nwords of Rabshakeh. \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 And Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a great voice in the\nJewish tongue, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the\nking of the Assyrians; \n 14 Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you with\nwords, which shall not be able to deliver you. \n 15 And let not Hezekiah say to you, God will deliver us, and.\nthis city shall not be given up into the hand of the king of the\nAssyrians. \n 16 Hearken not to Hezekiah. Thus saith the king of the\nAssyrians, If ye will be blessed, come out to me, and ye shall\neat everyone of his vine and his \ufb01gs, and drink the water of your\ncistern; \n 17 Until I come and take you to a land, as (is) your own land,\na land of corn and wine, and loaves, and vineyards. \n 18 Let not Hezekiah deceive you, saying, Your God will deliver\nus. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own\nland out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians? \n 19 Where is the god of Hamath and Arpad? and where is the\ngod of the city of Sepharvaim? were they able to deliver Samaria\nout of my hand? \n 20 Which of the gods of all these nations delivered his land\nout of my hand? that God shall deliver Jerusalem out of my\nhand; \n 21 And they were silent, and none answered him a word,\nbecause the king had commanded that none should answer. \n 22 And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the steward, went in, and\nShebna the scribe of the power, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the\nrecorder, unto Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and reported\nunto him the words of Rabshakeh. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XXXVII. 1 And it came to pass, when the king Hezekiah\nheard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth.\nand went into the house of the Lord \n 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna\nthe secretary, and the elders of the people, covered with sackcloth,\nunto Isaiah the prophet, the son. of Amoz. \n \u2019 3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a\nday of trouble, and chastisement, and contempt; for the children\nare come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. \n 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rab-\nshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his lord hath sent to reproach\nthe living God, and will chastise the words which the Lord thy\nGod hath heard; and thou wilt lift up prayer for the remnant that\nis found. \n 5 And the servants of the king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. \n 6 And- Isaiah said unto them, Thus- shall ye say unto your\nlord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith\nthe young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\n\u1f87 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall bear a message,\nand return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the\nsword in his own land. \n 8 And Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria\nwaning against Libnah, for he had heard that he had broken up\nfrom Lachish. \n 9 Ahd he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, He\nis gone forth to war against thee. And he heard, and sent\nmessengers to Hezekiah, saying, \n \n \n\n \n XXXVII. 1 And it came to pass, when the king Hezekiah\nheard (it), he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth about him, and\nwent up into the house of the Lord. \n 2 And he sent Eliakim, the steward, and Shebna, the scribe,\nand the elders of the priests, with sackcloth about them, unto\nIsaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. \n 3 And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, Today is a day\n\u1f22 of affliction, and reproach, and reproof, and anger; for the pang\nis come upon her that travaileth, and she hath not strength to\nbring forth. \n 4 The Lord God hear the words of Rabshakeh, with which\nthe king of the Assyrians sent him to reproach the living God,\nand to reproach with the words which the. Lord thy God hath\nheard; [and thou shalt pray to thy Lord] concerning these that\nare left. \n 5 And the servants of the king came to Isaiah \n 6 And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your lord,\nThus saith the Lord, Fear not thou for the words which thou\nhast heard, wherewith the envoys of the king of the Assyrians\nhave reproached me. \n 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings,\nand return to his land, and he shall fall by the sword in his\nland. \n 8 And Rabshakeh returned, and came upon the king besieging\nLibnah: and the king of the Assyrians heard \n 9 ThatTirhakah, king of the Ethiopians, had gone out to\nbesiege him; and when he heard it, he turned away, and sent\nmessengers to Hezekiah, saying, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, Let\nnot thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive \u2019 saying,\nJerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of\nAssyria. \n 11 Behold, thyself hast heard what the kings of Assyria have I\ndone to all the lands, putting them under the ban; and shalt thou\nbe delivered; \n 12 Did the gods of the nations, which my fathers destroyed,\ndeliver them? as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children\nof Eden which were in Telassar? \n 13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and\nthe king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena and IvvahP \n 14 And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers,\nand read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of\nthe LORD, and spread it before the Lord \n 15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord saying, \n 16 O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, that sittest upon the\ncherubim, thou art the God, thou alone, for all the kingdoms of\nthe earth; thou hast made the heavens and the earth. \n 17 Incline thine ear, Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O\nLORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he\nhath sent to reproach the living God. \n 18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all\nthe lands, and their land, \n 19 And have given their gods into the \ufb01re; for they were no\ngods, but the work of \u2019s hands, wood and stone; and have\ndestroyed them. \u2019 \n 20 And now, LORD our God, save us from his hand: and all\nthe kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou art the LORD,\nthou alone. \n \n\n \n 10 Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, Let not thy\nGod, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem\nshall be given over into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. \n 11 Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have\n-done to all the earth, how they have destroyed it? \n 12 Did the gods of the nations, they whom my fathers de-\nstroyed, deliver them? Gozan, and Haran, and [Rezeph], which\nare in the land of [Telassar]? \n 13 Where are the kings of Hamath, and of Arpad? and of\nthe city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? \n 14 And Hezekiah took the book from the messengers, and\nopened it before the Lord. \n 15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord, saying, \n 16 O Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the\ncherubim, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world;\nthou hast made heaven and earth. \n 17 Hearken, \u039f Lord; look upon us, Lord, and see the\nEzrdds of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach the living\nGod. \n 18 For in truth, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the\nwhole world, and their country, \n 19 And cast their idols into the \ufb01re; for they were no gods,\nbut the works of men's hands, wood and stone; and destroyed\nthem. \n 20 But do thou, O Lord our God, save us outof their hand,\ngag. every kingdom of the earth may know that thou alone art\nGod. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying,\nThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, As to what thou hast\nprayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria: \n 22 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning\nhim: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee, hath\nmocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head after thee. \n 23 Whom hast thou reproached and reviled? and against\nwhom hast thou raised high thy voice? thou hast lifted up thine\neyes on high against the Holy One of Israel. \n 24 By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the\nLord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I have\nascended the height of the mountains, the recesses of Lebanon;\nand I will cut down the \u2019loftiness of his cedars, the choice of his\n\ufb01r-trees; and I will come into the height of his border, the forest\nof his garden-land. \n 25 I have digged, and drunk waters; and with the sole of my\nfeet I will dry up all the canals of Mazor. \u2019 \n 26 Hast thou not heard? from long ago I made it, from\nancient days I formed it; now have I brought it to pass, and\nthou hast been (destined) to lay waste, as ruinous heaps, fortified\ncities. \n 27 And their inhabitants were short of hand, they were dis-\nmayed and ashamed: they were (as) grass of the \ufb01eld, and green\n\u2019algke, grass of the hoUse tops, and a cornfield before it stands\nin stalk \n 28 And thy down-sitting, and thy going out and thy coming\nin I know, andthy rage, against me. \n 29 Because thy rage against me and. thy recklessness is come\nup into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my bridle\nin thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou\ncamest. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 And Isaiah the son of Amoz was sent to Hezekiah, and\nsaid to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard\nthe prayers which thou madest to me concerning Sennacherib\nking of the Assyrians. \u2019 \n 22 This is the word which Godhath spoken concerning him;\nThe virgin daughter of Zion despiseth thee and mocketh thee;\nthe daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee. \n 23 Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? or against\n\u2019 hast thou lift up thy voice? what, hast thou not lifted up\nthine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel? \n 24 For by messengers thou hast reproached the Lord 3 for thou\nsaidst, By the multitude of my chariots have I gone up to the\nheight of the mountains, and to the utmost. parts of Lebanon,\nand have Cut down the height of his cedar, and the beauty of his\ncypress, and have entered into the height of the portion of his\nforest, \n 25 And have made a mound, and have dried up waters, and\nevery gathering of water. \n 26 Hast thou not heard long since of these things that I have\ndone? from ancient days have I ordained it, and now have I\nshown it forth, to make nations in strong places desolate, and\nthem that dwell in strong cities. \n 27 I slackened their hands, and they were withered up, and\nbecame as green grass upon house-tops, and as wild couch-grass. \n 28 But now I know thy resting place, and thy going out,\nthy coming in. \n 29 But thy rage with which thou ragedst, and thy bitterness,\nhave come up toward me, and I will put a muzzle on thy nose,\nand \u2019a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which\nthou camest. \n \n \n \n\n \n 30 And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year\nthat which groweth of itself, and the second year that which\nspringeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,\nand plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. \n 31 And the escaped of the house of Judah that are left, shall\nagain take root downward, and bear fruit upward. \n 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they\nthat escape out of mount Zion; the jealousy of the LORD of\nHosts shall do this. \n 33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of\nAssyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow\nthere, nor come before it with shields, nor cast up a bank\nagainst it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and\nshall not come into this city, saith the Lord. \n 35 And I will protect this city, to save it, for mine own sake,\nand for my servant \u2019s sake. \n 36 And the. angel \u2019the Lord went out, and smote in the\ncamp of Assyria an hundred and fourscore and five thousand:\nand (men) arose earl in the morning, and behold, they were all\ndead corpses. \n 37 And Sennacherib king of Assyria broke up, and went, and\nreturned, and dwelt at Nineveh. \n 38 And it came \u2019pass, as he was worshipping in the house of -\nNisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote\n\u2019 him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat;\nand Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. \n XXXVIII. 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.\nAnd Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came unto him, and\nsaid unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Give orders to thine house;\nfor thou diest, and shalt not live. \n \n \n \n\n \n 30 And this is the sign to thee; eat, for this year, what thou\nhast sown, and in the second year that which is left; and in the\nthird year sow and reap ye, and plant vineyards, and ye shall eat\nthe fruit thereof. \n 31 And there shall be they that are left in Judah, they shall\nstrike root downward, and bear seed upward. \n 32 For they that are left shall go forth from Jerusalem, and\nthey that are saved from mount Zion; the jealousy of the Lord of\nHosts will do this. \n 33 Therefore thus saith the Lord against the king of the\nAssyrians, He shall not come into this city, nor cast a spear\nagainst it, nor bring up a shield against it, nor compass it with a\ntrench, \n 34 But by the way that he came, by it shall he return. Thus\nsaith the Lord, \n 35 I will hold a shield before this city, to save it, for mine own\nsake, and for David my \u2019s sake. \n 36 And there went forth an angel of the Lord, and destroyed\nout of the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and fourscore\n(and) \ufb01ve thousand; and (men) arising early found all the dead\nbodies. \n 37 And Sennacherib king of the Assyrians turned, and\ndeparted, and dwelt at Nineveh. \u2019 \n 38 And as he was worshipping the god of his fathers in the\nhouse of N isroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him\nwith swords; but they made good their escape into Armenia; and\nEsarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. \u2019 \n XXXVIII. I And it came to pass at that time, Hezekiah\nfell sick unto death; and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,\ncame unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Give\norders concerning thine house; for thou diest, and shalt not live. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto\nthe Lord, \n 3 And said, Ah LORD, remember, I pray thee, how that I have\nwalked before thee in truth and with whole heart, and have done\nthat which is good in thine eyes. And Hezekiah wept, a great\nweeping. \n 4 And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, \n 5 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of\nDavid thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:\nbehold, I am adding to thy days \ufb01fteen years. \n 6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the grasp of the\nking of Assyria, and I will protect this city. \n 7 And this shall be the sign unto thee from the Lord, that the\nLORD will do this thing which he hath spoken \n 8 Behold, I am turning the shadow of the steps, which it has\ngone down on the steps. of Ahaz by the sun, ten steps back-\nward. And the sun returned ten steps, on the steps whereon it\nwas gone down. \n 9 \u0391 writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had been\nsick, and come to life from his sickness: \n 10 I said, In the stillness of my days I shall go into the gates\nof hell; I am deprived of the residue of my years. \n 11 I said, I shall not see Jah, Jab in the land of the living;\n\u0399 shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of ceasing. \n 12 My habitation is plucked up, and carried away from me like\na \u2019s tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he \u2019\ncutteth me off from the thrum; from day to night thou wilt make\nan end of me. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto\nthe Lord, \n 3 Saying, Remember, Lord, how I have walked before thee\nwith truth, with a true heart, and have done that which is pleasing\nin thy sight; and Hezekiah wept with great weeping. \n 4 And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, \n 5 Go, and tell Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of\nDavid thy father, I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and have\nseen thy tears; behold, I add unto thy time \ufb01fteen years: \n 6 And I will save thee out of the hand of the king of the\nAssyrians, and I will hold a shield before this city. \n 7 And this is the sign to thee from the Lord, that God will\naccomplish this word. \n 8 Behold, I turn the shadow of the steps, down which the sun\nhas gone, the ten steps of the house of thy father; I will turn the\nsun back the ten steps. And the sun went up (again) the ten-\nsteps, down which the shadow had gone. \u2019 \n 9 [A song.] Prayer of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had\nfallen sick, and arisen from his Sickness. \n 10 I said, At the height of my days, in the gates of hell I shall\nleave the residue of my years. \n 11 \u0399 said, I shall no more see the salvation of God in the\nland, I shall no more see man. \n 12 From among my kindred; I have left behind the residue\nof my-life; it is gone forth and departed from me, like him\nthat looseth. his tent which he hath pitched; my spirit in me\nbecame as a web, when she that weaveth draweth near to cut\nit off. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 I quieted myself till morning; as a lion, so he breaketh\nall my bones; from day to night thou wilt make an end of me. \n 14 Like a swift, a crane, so did I chatter; I did moan like a\ndove; mine eyes failed towards the height; LORD, I am\noppressed; be thou surety for me. \n 15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself\nhath done it; I shall go softly all my years, because of the\nbitterness of \u2019my soul. \n 16 O Lord, by these things men live, and wholly in them is\nthe life of my spirit; and thou wilt recover me, and make me to\nlive. \n 17 Behold, for peace it was bitter to me, bitter; and thou hast \u2019\nloved my soul from the pit of destruction; for thou hast cast all\nmy sins behind thy back. 18 For hell cannot give thee thanks, death praise thee; they\nthat go down to the pit cannot hope for thy truth. \n 19 The living, the living, he shall give thee thanks, as I do\nthis day; the father shall. make the sons to know concerning thy\ntruth. \n 20 The LORD (was ready) to save me; and we will play on my\nstringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the\nLORD. \n 21 And Isaiah said, They shall take a cake of \ufb01gs, and apply\nit to the boil, and he shall live. \n 22 And Hezekiah said, What sign is there, that I shall go up\nto the house of the LORD? \u2019 \n XXXIX. I At that time Merodach Baladan, son of Baladan,\nking of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah;\nand he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 In that day was I given over until morning, as to a lion ; so\nhath he crushed all my bones; for from the day until night was\nI given over. \n 14 As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a clove, so will I rehearse\nit; for mine eyes have failed from looking up to the height of\nheaven to the Lord, who rescued me, and took away the anguish\nof my soul. \n 15 * * * * * * * \n 16 \u039f Lord; yea, it was told thee concerning it, and thou\ndidst rouse up my breath, and I was comforted, and came to life. \n 17 For thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish,\nand hast cast away all my sins behind me. \n 18 For they that are in hell shall not praise thee, nor shall the\ndead bless thee, nor they in hell hope_for thy mercy. \n 19 The living shall bless thee, as I also do ; for from today\nwill I beget children which shall declare thy righteousness, \n 20 O Lord of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee\nupon the psaltery, all the days of my life, in front of the house of\nGod. \n 21 And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Take a cake of \ufb01gs, and\nbruise it, and apply it as a plaister, and thou shalt be whole. \n 22 And Hezekiah said, This is the sign, that I shall go up into\nthe house of the Lord God. \n XXXIX. I At that time Merodach, the son of Baladan,\nking of Babylonia, sent a letter and envoys and presents to\nHezekiah; for he heard that he had fallen sick unto death, and\nhad arisen again. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And Hezekiah was glad because of them, and shewed them\nhis treasure-house, the silver and the gold, and the spices, and the\n\ufb01ne oil, and all his armoury, and all that was found among his\ntreasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion,\nthat Hezekiah showed them not. \n 3 Isaiah the prophet came unto king Hezekiah, and said\nunto him, What said men, and whence came they unto thee?\nAnd Hezekiah said, They came from a far country unto me, from\nBabylon. \n 4 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And\nHezekiah said, All that is in my house have they seen; there is\nnothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. \n 5 And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of\nHosts: \n 6 Behold, the days are coming, and all that is in thine house,\nand that thy fathers have stored up until this day, shall be carried\nto Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the Lord \n 7 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt\nbeget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the\npalace of the kings of Babylon. \n 8. And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord\nwhich thou hast spoken. And he said, For there shall be peace\nand truth in my days. \n XL. 1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. \n 2 Speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that\nher warfare is \ufb01lled, that her guilt is satisfied; for she hath\nreceived of the \u2019s hand double fOr all her sins. \n \n\n \n 2 And Hezekiah rejoiced with great joy over them, and showed\nthem the house of the treasury, and of the balsam, and the\nincense, and the myrrh, and the silver, and the gold, and all the\nhouses of the vessels of the treasure, and all that was among his\ntreasures; and there was nothing which Hezekiah showed them\nnot in his house. \n 3 And Isaiah the prOphet came to the king Hezekiah, and said\nto him, What say these men, and from whence are they come to\nthee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a land (from)\nafar unto me, from Babylon. \n 4 And Isaiah said, What saw they in thine house? An\n\u2019Hezekiah said, They saw all that is in my house, and there is\nnothing in my house which they saw not, but (they saw) even that\nwhich is among my treasures: \n 5 And Isaiah said unto him, Hear the word of the Lord of\nHosts; \n 6 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and they shall take\nall that is in thine house, and all that thy fathers gathered together\nunto this day shall come to Babylon, and they shall leave nothing\nbehind; and God said, \n 7 They shall take also of thy children, which thou shalt beget,\nand shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the\nBabylonians. \n 8 And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is Lord's word\nwhich he hath spoken: let there be now peace and righteousness\nin my days. \n XL. 1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith the Lord. \n 2 Ye priests, speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem, comfort her,\nfor her humbling is \ufb01lled, her sin is atoned for, for she hath\nreceived of the \u2019s hand double of her sins. \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 A voice of one crying: In the wilderness clear ye the way\nof the LORD, make level in the desert a highway for our God. \n 4 Every \u2019valley shall \u2019 exalted, and every mountain and hill\nshall be brought low; and the rugged shall become a level, and\nthe rough places a plain: \n 5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all \ufb02esh\ntogether shall see: forthe mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. \n 6 A voice of one saying, Cry! land he said, What shall I cry?\nAll flesh is grass, and all the goodness thereof like a \ufb02ower of the field. \n 7 The grass is withered, the \ufb02ower faded: because the breath\nof the LORD hath blown upon it; surely the people is grass. \n 8 The grass is withered, the \ufb02ower faded; but the word of our\nGod shall stand for ever. \n 9 Get thee up upon a high mountain, thou that bringest good\ntidings to Zion; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest\ngood tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, be not afraid! say unto the\ncities of Judah, Behdld your God \n 10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a strong one, his\narm ruling for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his\nrecompense before him. \n 11 He shall feed his \ufb02ock like a shepherd: he shall gather\nthe lambs with his arm, and carry (them) in his bosom: he shall\ntend those that give suck. \n 12 Who hath measured the waters with the hollow of his hand,\nand meted out the heavens with the span, and comprehended the\ndust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in\na balance, and the hills in scales? \n 13 Who hath meted out the Spirit of the Lord, and, as the\nman of his counsel, made him to know; \n 14 With whom took he counsel, and he caused him to discern,\nand taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him know-\nledge, and made him to know the way of discernment? \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 A voice, of one cryingiin the wilderness, Prepare ye the way\nof the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. \n 4 Every valley shall be \ufb01lled up, and every mountain and hill\nshall be brought low; and the crooked places shall become\na straight (path), and the rough land smooth ways. \n 5 And the glory of the Lord shall be seen, and all \ufb02esh shall\nsee the salvation of God, for the Lord hath spoken. \n 6 A voice of one saying, Cry! And I said, What shall I cry?\n\u2019All \ufb02esh (is) grass, and all glory of man (is) as the \ufb02ower of\ngrass. \n 7 * * * * * \n 8 The grass is withered, and the \ufb02ower is fallen; but the word\nof our God abideth for ever. \n 9 Go up upon a high mountain, thou that bringest good\ntidings to Zion; lift up thy voice with thy strength, thou that\nbringest good tidings to Jerusalem: lift ye up (your voice), fear\nnot; say thou to the cities of Judah, Behold your God. \n 10 Behold, the Lord cometh with strength, and his arm with\npower: behold, his reward (is) with him, and his work before him. \n 11 As a shepherd shall he tend his \ufb02ock, and with his arm\nshall he gather lambs, and shall comfort those with young. \n 12 Who measured the water with his hand, and the heaven\nwith a span, and all the earth with a handful? Who hath weighed\nthe mountains with a scale, and the valleys with a balance? \n 13 Who hath understood the mind of the Lord, and who was\nhis fellow-counsellor, that shall teach him? \n 14 Or with whom shared be his counsel, and he taught him?\nor who showed him judgment? or who showed him the way of\nunderstanding? or who gave to him at the \ufb01rst, and it shall be\nrendered him again? \u2019 \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 Behold, nations (are) as a drop from a bucket, and are\ncounted as a grain on the scales: behold, he will lift up the isles\nas \ufb01ne dust. \n 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, nor its beasts\nsufficient for (a burnt) sacrifice. \n 17 All the nations are as nothing before him, and are counted\nto him as of nought, and waste. \u2019 \n 18 And to whom will ye liken God? and what likeness will ye\ncompare unto him? \n 19 The graven image, a craftsman melteth it, and the smelter]\n\u2019covereth it with gold, and smelteth silver chains. \n 20 He that is impoverished as to an offering chooseth a tree\nthat will not rot: he seeketh unto him a cunning craftsman, to\nset up a graven image, that will not totter. \n 21 Do ye not know? do ye not hear? hath it not been told to\nyou from the beginning? have ye not discerned from the founda-\n\u2019of the earth? \n 22 He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants\nhabitants are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as\n\ufb01ne gauze, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; \n 23 That giveth over chiefs to nothing; he maketh the judges\nof the earth as waste. \n 24 Yea, they have not been planted, yea, they have not been\nsown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth; and he\n- even bloweth upon them, and they wither, and a whirlwind taketh\n\u2019 - them away as stubble. \n 25 To whom then will ye liken me, and I shall be equal to\nhim? saith the Holy One. \n 26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see: who hath created\nthese? he who bringeth out their host by number; he calleth\nthem all by name, from the greatness of his might, and being\nstrong in power: not one is missing. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 If all the nations had been reckoned as a drop from a jar,\nor as the turn of a scale, shall they be reckoned even as spittle? \n 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, and all the (four\nfooted) beasts are not sufficient for a (whole) burnt offering. \n 17 And all the nations are as nothing, and are reckoned for\nnothing. \n 18 To whom liken ye the Lord, and with what likeness liken\nye him? \n 19 Doth the craftsman make an image, or a goldsmith cast\ngold, and gild it over? doth he construct of it a likeness? \n 20 For a craftsman chooseth out a tree which doth not rot,\nand seeketh cunningly how to set up an image there: and that it\nmay not be moved. \n 21 Will ye not learn? will ye not hear? was it not proclaimed\nto you from the beginning? have ye not learnt the foundations of\nthe earth? \n 22 (It is) he that holdeth the circle of the earth, and they that\ndwell in it are as locusts; he that setteth up the heaven as\na canopy, and stretcheth it out as a tent to dwell in, \n 23 He that giveth rulers to rule as nothing, and he made the\nearth as nothing. \u2019 \n 24 For they shall not sow, nor plant, neither shall their root be\nrooted in the earth; he breatheth upon them, and they are\nwithered, and a tempest shall seize upon them as brushwood. \n 25 Now therefore to whom liken ye me, and I shall be exalted?\nsaith the Holy One. \n 26 Look up on high with your eyes, and see; who hath shown\nforth all these things? he, that bringeth forth his array by number,\nwill call them all by name from the abundance of his glory, and in\nthe might of strength nothing faileth thee. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way\nis hid from the LORD, and my judgment will pass away from my\nGod? \n 28 Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard? an everlasting\nGod is the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth; he fainteth\nnot, neither is\u2014there is no searching of his\u2014 \n 29 Giving power to the weary; and to the powerless he in- \u2019\ncreaseth strength. \u2019 \n 30 And youths faint and are weary, and young men stumble: \n 31 But they that wait for the LORD shall renew strength; they\n\u2019shall lift up wings like the eagles: they shall run and not be\nweary, they shall walk and not faint. \n XLI. 1 Keep silence before me, O isles; and the peoples\nshall renew strength; let them come near, then let them speak;\nlet us draw near together to judgment. \n 2 Who raised up from the East him (whom) Righteousness\ncalleth to his foot; gave up nations before him, maketh him\nsubdue kings; giveth them as dust for his sword, as driven\nstubble for his bow? \n 3 He pursueth them, passeth on in peace: a path he shall not\ngo with his feet. \n 4 Who hath wrought and done it? He that calleth the gene-\nrations from the beginning; I the LORD am the first, and with\nthe last, I am he. \n 5 The isles have seen it, and are afraid: the ends of the earth\ntremble; they have drawn near, and come. \u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 27 For say not, Jacob, and why sayest thou, Israel, My way is\nhid from God, and my God hath taken away my judgment, and\nhath stood aloof \n 28 And now, hast thou not learnt? hast thou not heard? the\neverlasting God, God who hath framed the ends of the earth, will\nnot hunger, nor grow\u2014nor is there any \ufb01nding out of his\nunderstanding\u2014. \n 29 Giving strength to the hungry, and pain to them that\nsuffer not. \n 30 For youths shall hunger, and young men shall be weary,\nand chosen men shall be without strength: \n 31 But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength;\nthey shall put forth wings as eagles; they shall run, and shall not\nbe weary; they shall walk, and shall not hunger. \n XLI. 1 Be made new. toward me, ye islands: for the rulers\nshall renew their strength: let them draw near, and let them\nspeak together, then let them proclaim judgment. \n 2 Who roused up righteousness from the rising of the sun,\ncalled it to his feet, it shall go forth? he shall set it before\nnations, and shall astonish kings; and he shall lay their swords\nupon the earth, and their bows as brushwood that is cast forth. \n 3 And he shall pursue them, and the way of his feet shall pass\nover in peace. \n 4 Who hath wrought and done these things? he called it, that\ncalled it from the beginning of generations; I, even God, am the\n\ufb01rst, and unto the times to come, I am. \n 5 The nations saw, and were afraid, the ends of the earth drew\nnear, and came together, \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 They help everyone his neighbour; and one saith to his\nbrother, Be strong! \n 7 And the craftsman strengthened the smelter, he that smootheth\nwith the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering,\nIt is good: and he fasteneth it with nails, that it should\nnot totter. \n 8 And thou, Israel my sevant, Jacob whom I have chosen;\nthe seed of Abraham that loved me; \n 9 Thou on whom I have taken hold from the ends of the\nearth, and called thee from the corners thereof; and said to thee,\nThou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not rejected thee. \n 10 Behold, all they that were hot against thee shall be\nashamed and cofounded; they shall be as nought, ans shall\nperish, the men of thy strife. \n 12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, the men of\nthy contention; the men of thy war shall be as nought, and as\nnothingess. \n 13 For I, the LORD thy Gid, do hold fast thy right hadn; he\nthat saith to thee, Fear not, I have helped thee. \n 14 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye few men of Israel; I do\nhelp thee, saith the LORD, and the Holy One of Israel is thy\nredeemer. \n 15 Behold, I have set thee for a threshing sledge, sharp, new,\nwith edges; thou shalt thresh mountains, and grind them fine,\nand shalt make hills as chaff. \n 16 Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them\naway, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt exult\nin the LORD, shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. \n\n \n 6 \u2019everyone to help his neighbour and his brother,\nand he shall say, \n 7 The craftsman is strong, and the smith smiting with a\nhammer, beating withal; then will he say, The joining is good,\n\u2019 they have made them strong with nails; they will set them in\nplace, and they shall not be moved. \n 8 But thou, Israel, (art) my servant, Jacob whom I have\nchosen, the seed of Abraham whom I loved: \n 9 On whom I took hold from the ends of the earth, and called\nthee fromthe watch towers thereof, and said to thee, Thou art my\nservant; I have chosen thee, and not forsaken thee. \n 10 Fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayedL for I am\nthy God that strengtheneth thee; and I have helped thee, and\nhave saved thee from falling by my just right hand. \n 11 Behold, all they that resist thee shall be ashamed and\nturned backward; for they shall be as though they were not, and\nall thy adversaries shall perish. \n 12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not \ufb01nd the men \u2019who\nshall evil intreat thee; for they shall be as though they were not,\nand they that war against thee shall cease to be. \n 13 For I am God, that hold fast thy right hand, that \u2019to\nthee, Fear not, \n 14 Jacob, thou little Israel; I have helped thee, saith the\nGod that ransometh thee, Israel. \n 15 Behold, I make thee as wheels of a cart, that thresh out;\nnew, with teeth like a saw; and thou shalt thresh the mountains,\nand beat small the hills, and shalt make them as dust. \n 16 And thou shalt winnow them, and a wind shall take them,\nand a tempest shall scatter them. But thou shalt rejoice among\nthe holy things of Israel. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 The afflicted and needy are seeking water, and there is\nnone; their tongue is parched with thirst: I the Lord will hear\nthem, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. \n 18 I will open rivers on bare heights, and fountains in the\nmidst of valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and\ndry land springs of water. \n 19 I will give in the wilderness cedar, acacia, and myrtle, and\noil-tree; I will set in the desert \ufb01r, plane, and larch together. \n 20 That they may see, and learn, and consider, and under-\nstand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and\nthe Holy One of Israel hath created it. \n 21 Bring near your cause, saith the LORD; bring up your\nstrengths, saith the King of Jacob. \n 22 Let them bring them up, and tell us what shall happen;\ntell ye of the former things, what they be, that we may apply our\nheart, and learn their issue; or make us to hear the things that\nare coming. \n 23 Tell the things that are. to come hereafter, that, we may\nlearn that ye are gods; yea, do good and do evil, that we may\nlook around, and see (it) together. \n 24 Behold ye are of nought, and your work of nothingness:\nan abomination is he that chooseth you. \n 25 I have roused up one from the north, and he came: from\nthe rising of the sun one that \u2019calleth on my name; and he shall\ncome upon rulers as morter, and as a \u2018potter (that) treadeth clay. \n 26 Who hath told from the beginning, that we may know?\nand from before, that we may say, It is right! Yea, there, is\nnOne that telleth, yea none that maketh to be heard, yea none\nthat heareth your words. \u2019 \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 And the poor and the needy shall triumph. For they shall\nseek water, and there shall be none; their tongue is dried up with\nthirst. I the Lord God, I the God of Israel will hear, and will\nnot forsake them. \n 18 But I will open rivers upon the mountains, and fountains in\nthe midst of the plains; I will make the wilderness into pools,\nand the thirsty land into watercourses. \n 19 I will plant in the waterless land cedar and box, and myrtle\nand cypress, and white poplar; \n 20 That they may see, and learn, and understand, and know\ntogether that the hand of the Lord hath done all this, and the\nHoly One of Israel hath shown it forth. \n 21 Your judgment draweth near, saith the Lord God; your\ncounsels have drawn near, saith the King of Jacob. \n 22 Let them draw near, and declare unto you what shall come\nto pass; or tell ye (of) the former things, what they were, and we\nwill apply our thoughts; and perceive what the last things be:\nand tell us the things that are coming. \n 23 Declare the things that are coming at the last, and we shall\nperceive that ye are gods: do good, and do evil, and we will\nwonder. \n 24 For whence are ye, and whence is your working? from the\nearth. As an abomination have they chosen you. \n 25 I have raised up him from the north, and him from the\nrising of the sun; they shall be called by my name; let rulers.\ncome, and like clay of a potter, and like a potter treading clay, so\nshall ye be trodden down. \u2019 \n 26 For who shall proclaim the things from, the beginning, that\nwe may learn them? or the former things, and we shall say that\nthey are true? there is none that foretelleth, nor any that heareth\nyour words. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 27 First to Zion, Behold, behold them; and to Jerusalem will\nI give one that bringeth good tidings. \n 28 And I saw, and there was no man; and among these, and\nthere was no counsellor, that I should ask of them, and they\nshould answer a word. \n 29 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are \u2019;\ntheir molten images are wind and wasteness. \n XLII. I Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect,\n(in whom) my soul is well pleased: I have put my soul upon\nhim; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations. \n 2 He shall not cry out, nor lift up, nor make his voice heard\nin the street. \n 3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and a dimly burning wick\nshall he not quench; according to truth shall he bring forth\njudgment. \n 4 He shall not burn dimly nor be bruised, till he (shall) set\njudgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law. \n 5 Thus saith the God, the LORD, he that created the heavens,\nand stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and the\nthings that come forth of it; that giveth breath unto the people\nupon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: \n 6 \u0399 the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will take\nhold of thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant\nof the people, for -a light of the nations: \n 7 To open blind eyes, to bring out a captivefrom prison, and\nthem that sit in darkness from a house of confinement \n 8 Iam the Lord; that is my name; and my glory will I not\ngive to another, and my praise to graven images. \n 9 The \ufb01rst things, behold, they have come, andI am telling\nnew things; before they spring up I cause you to hear of them. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 27 I will give rule to Zion, and will comfort Jerusalem in\nthe way. \n 28 For from the nations, behold, no man; and from among\ntheir idols there was none that declared (aught), and if I ask of\nthem, Whence are ye? they will not answer me. \n 29 For they are those that make you, and vain are they that\nlead you astray. \n XLII. 1 Jacob my servant, on him will I take hold;\nIsrael (is) my chosen, my soul hath received him; I have put my\nspirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment for the nations. \n 2 He shall not cry out, nor send forth (his voice), nor shall his\nvoice be heard without. \n 3 A bruised reed shall he not crush, and smoking \ufb02ax shall he\nnot quench, but shall bring forth judgment unto truth. \n 4. He shall shine out, and shall not be shattered, until he have\niegpiudgment upon the earth; and in his name shall nations \n 5 Thus saith the Lord, the God who made the heaven and\n\ufb01xed it, who established the earth and the things therein, and\ngrave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread\nthereon, \n 6 \u0399 the Lord God have called thee in righteousness, and will\nhold fast thine hand, and will strengthen thee, and have given\nI thee for a covenant of a race, for a light of nations. \n 7 To open blind \u2019s eyes, to lead out from bonds them that\nare bound, and men that sit in darkness out of a prison house. \n 8 \u0399 am the Lord God: this is my name; my glory will I not\ngive to another, nor my excellences to the graven images. \n 9 The things from of old, behold, they are come; and new\nthings do I proclaim, and before they sprang up they were made\nplain to you. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise from the end of\nthe earth; ye that go down (to) the sea, and the fulness thereof;\nthe isles, and the inhabitants thereof. \n 11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up (their\nvoice): the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants\nof Sela shout, let them cry aloud from the top of mountains. \n 12 They shall give honour to the Lord, and tell his praise\namong the isles. \n 13 The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall rouse\nup zeal like a man of war: he shall shout, yea, roar; he shall\ndo mightily against his enemies. \n 14 I have been silent from of old: I have been still, and\nrefrained myself; (now) will I cry like a travailing woman; I will\ngasp and pant together. \n 15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their\nherbage; and I will turn rivers to islands, and I will dry up\npools. \n 16 And I will make the blind walk by a way that they knew\nnot; I will make them tread in paths they knew not; I will turn\ndarkness to light before them, and uneven places into a plain.\nThese are the things, I will do them, and will not abandon them. \n 17 They are turned back; they shall be ashamed, that\ntrust in the graven images, that say to the molten image, Ye are\nour gods. \n 18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. \n 19 Who is blind, but my servant, and deaf, but my messenger\nwhom I (shall) send? who is blind as the surrendered one, and\nblind as the Lord's servant? \n 20 Thou hast seen many things, but thou observest Inot:\nopening the ears, and he heareth not. \n \n \n\n \n 10 Sing unto the Lord a new song; it is his dominion; glorify\nhis name at the end of the earth, ye that go down unto the sea\nand sail upon it: the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. \n 11 Be glad, O wilderness and the villages thereof; ye lodges,\nand the inhabitants of Kedar. They that dwell in a rock shall be\nglad, upon the tops of the mountains. \n 12 They shall give glory to God, they shall proclaim his excellence\nin the isles. \n 13 The Lord, the God of powers, shall come forth, and shall\nbreak war in pieces: he shall stir up jealousy, and shall shout\nagainst his enemies with might. \n 14 I have been silent: shall I be silent even for ever, and hold\nmy peace? I endured, as she that travaileth; I will amaze, and\nI will dry up together. \n 15 And I will turn rivers into islands, and will dry up\npools. \n 16 And I will lead blind men by a way that they had not\nlearnt, and will make them to tread paths which they knew not;\nI will make their darkness into light, and the crooked things into\n(a) straight (path); these (are) the things which I will do, and will\nnot forsake them. \n 17 But they turned away backward. Be utterly ashamed, ye\nthat trust in the graven images; that say to the molten images,\nYe are our gods. \n 18 Hear, ye deaf; and look up, ye blind, and see. \n 19 And who is blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that\nare lords over them? and the slaves of God are blinded. \n 20 Full oft have ye seen, and taken not heed; your ears are\nopened, and ye heard not. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 The Lord was pleased for his righteousness\u2019 sake: he\nmake the law great, and make it glorious. \n 22 And it is a people spoiled and robbed: snared in holes all\nof them, and hidden in houses of confinement; they are for\na spoil, and there is none that delivereth; a prey, and none that\nsaith, Restore. \n 23 Who among you will give ear to this? will hearken, and\nhear for the time to come? \n 24 Who gave up Jacob for a prey, and Israel to spoilers? was\nit not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? And they\nwould not walk in his ways, and heard not his law. \n 25 And be poured upon him fury, his anger, and the violence\nof war; and it set him on \ufb01re round about, and he knew not;\nand kindled upon him, and he laid it not to heart. \n XLIII. I And now thus saith the Lord, that created thee,\nO Jacob, and that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not; for I have\nredeemed thee, I have called (thee) by thy name, thou (art) mine. \n 2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee;\nand through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou\nwalkest through the \ufb01re, thou shalt not be scorched, and the\n\ufb02ame shall not kindle upon thee. \n 3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\nSaviour; I have given Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba\nin thy stead. \n 4 Since thou art (become) precious in mine eyes, hast been\nhonoured, and I have loved thee; therefore I will give man in thy\nstead, and people for thy life. \n 5 Fear not; for I am with thee: I Will bring thy seed from\nthe East, and gather thee from the West: \n 6 I will say to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not\nback: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of\nthe earth: \n \n \n\n \n 21 The Lord God took counsel, that he might be justified, and\nmight magnify praise. \n 22 And I saw, and the people was plundered and spoiled; for\nthe snare is in treasuries everywhere, and in houses together;\nwhere they hid themselves, they became a prey; and there was\nnone that set free a prey, and there was none that said, Restore. \n 23 Who is there among you that will give ear to this? he shall\nhearken, for the time to come. \n 24 Who gave Jacob for a prey, and Israel to them that plunder\nhim? Is it not God, before whom they sinned, and they would\nnot walk in his ways, nor hear his law? \n 25 And he brought upon them the fury of his wrath, and war\noverpowered them, and they that set them on fire round about,\nand they understood not, each of them, neither laid it to heart. \n XLIII. I And now thus saith the Lord God, who created\nthee, O Jacob, he that formed thee, O Israel. Fear not, for\nI have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art\nmine. \n 2 Though thou pass through water, I am with thee, and rivers\nshall not overwhelm thee; though thou go through \ufb01re, thou shalt\nnot be burned, \ufb02ame shall not burn thee up. \n 3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\nSaviour; I have made Egypt and Ethiopia thy ransom, and set\nSyene in thy stead. \n 4 Since thou hast become precious in my sight, thou hast been\nglorified, and I have loved thee; and I will give many men on\nbehalf of thee, and rulers for thy head. \n 5 Fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy seed from the\nEast, and will gather thee from the West \n 6 I will say to the North, Bring (them); and to the South, Keep\nnot back: bring my sons from a land afar off, and my daughters\nfrom the ends of the earth, \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 Everyone that is called by my name, and that I have created\nfor my glory; that I have formed, yea, have made. \n 8 Bring forth a blind people, and they have eyes; and deaf\nones, and they have ears. \n 9 All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are\nassembled: who among them will tell this, and cause us to hear\nformer things? let them produce their witnesses, and appear\nrighteous, and let them hear, and say, (It is) truth \n 10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant,\nwhom I have chosen; that ye may know, and believe me, and\ndiscern that I am he; before me there was no God formed,\nneither shall there be after me. \n 11 I, I am the Lord, and beside me is no Saviour. \n 12 Myself have told, and have saved, and have caused it to be\nheard, and there was no stranger among you; and ye are my\nwitnesses, saith the Lord, and I am God. \n 13 Yea, from the beginning I am he: and there is none that\ndelivereth out of my hand: I will work, and who shall turn it\nback? \n 14 Thus saith the Lord, your redeemer, the Holy One of\nIsrael: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and will bring down\nall of them as fugitives, and the Chaldaeans in the ships of their\nshouting \n 15 I the Lord am your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your\nKing. \n 16 Thus saith the Lord, which giveth a way in the sea, and\na path in the mighty waters: \n 17 Which bringeth forth chariot and horse, force and warrior:\nthey lie down together, they shall not rise: they are quenched,\nthey are gone out like a wick: \n \n \n\n \n 7 All that have been called by my name. For in my glory\nhave I established him, and formed (him), and made him, \n 8 And I led forth a blind people, and their eyes are likewise\nblind, and they are deaf, though they have ears, \n 9 All the nations are gathered together, and rulers shall be\ngathered from among them; who shall declare these things?\nor who shall declare to you what was from the beginning? let\nthem bring their witnesses, and let them be approved, and let\nthem speak truth, and let them hear. \n 10 Be ye witnesses to me, and I am witness, saith the Lord\nGod, and the servant whom I have chosen out; that ye may learn,\nand believe me, and understand that I am; before me there came\nno other God, and after me there shall be none. \n 11 I am God, and beside me there is no Saviour. \n 12 I declared, and I saved, I reproached, and there was no\nstranger among you; ye are my witnesses, and I am witness, saith\nthe Lord God, \n 13 Even from the beginning, and there is none that delivereth\nout of my hands: I will do it, and who shall turn it back? \n 14 Thus saith the Lord God who redeemeth you, the Holy One\nof Israel: For your sakes will I send to Babylon, and will rouse up\nall that \ufb02ee, and the Chaldaeans shall be bound in stocks. \n 15 I am the Lord, God your holy one, he that shewed forth\nIsrael your king. \n 16 Thus saith the Lord, that giveth a way in the sea, and a path\nin the mighty water, \n 17 He that bringeth forth chariots, and horse, and a mighty\nthrong; but they have lain down, and shall not arise, they are\nquenched as \ufb02ax that is quenched: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 Remember ye not the \ufb01rst things, neither consider the\nthings of old. \n 19 Behold, I do a new thing; now is it springing forth; will\nye not know it? Yea, I will set a way in the wilderness, rivers in\nthe desert. \n 20 The beast of the \ufb01eld shall honour. me, jackals and\n(daughters of) ostriches : for I have given \u2019waters in the wilderness,\nrivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. \n 21 The people which 1,\u0399 have formed for myself, they shall\nrecount my praise. \n 22 And thou hast noi: called upon me, Jacob : for thou hast\nbeen weary of me, O Israel. \n 23 Thou hast not brought me the\u2019lambs of thy burnt offerings,\nneither hast thou honoured me with tb\u2019y sacri\ufb01ces: I have not\ncaused thee to serve with a (meal) offering,nor wearied thee with .\nincense. \n 24 Thou hast not bought me sweet cane with silver, neither\nhast thou steeped me with the fat of thy sacri\ufb01ces: only thou\nhast caused me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with a\nthine iniquities. \n 25 I, I am he that blotteth out thy rebellions for mine own\nsake, and I will not remember thy sins. \n 26 Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: do thou\nrecount, that thou mayest appear righteous. \n 27 Thy \ufb01rst father sinned, and thine interpreters rebelled \u201d\nagainst me. \n 28 And I will profane princes of holiness, and will give up\nJacob to the ban, and Israel to reproaches. \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 Remember ye <not> the \ufb01rst things, and consider not\nthings of old. \n 19 Behold, I do new things which shall now arise, and ye shall\nlearn them: and I will make a path in the desert, and rivers in\nthe waterless land: \n 20 The beasts of the \ufb01eld shall praise me, owls, and the\ndaughters of ostriches; because I have given water in the desert,\nand rivers in the waterless land, I will give my chosen race to\ndrink, \n 21 My people, whom I have preserved to set forth my\nexcellences. \n 22 Not now have I called thee, Jacob, nor made thee weary,\nIsrael: \n 23 No sheep have I of thy offering, nor didst thou glorify me\nin thy sacrifices, nor serve in thy sacrifices; nor have I wearied\nthee with frankincense, \n 24 Neither didst thou buy for me incense for silver, nor did\nI desire the fat of thy offerings; but in thy sins and in thine\nunrighteousness I stood before thee. \n 25 I am, I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions and will\nnot remember thine unrighteousnesses. \n 26 But do thou remember, and let us be judged; tell thou\n\ufb01rst thy transgressions, that thou mayest be justified. \n 27 Our fathers \ufb01rst, and their rulers transgressed against me? \n 28 And the rulers defiled my holy things; and I gave Jacob\nover to destroy (him) and Israel for a reproach. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XLIV. 1 And now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel,\nwhom I have chosen; \n 2 Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from\nthe womb, that will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant, and\n(thou) Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. \n 3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and flowing\nstreams upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy\nseed, and my blessing upon them that go forth of thee. \n 4 And they shall spring up in the midst of the grass, as\nwillows by the water courses. \n 5 This one shall say, I am the \u2019s; and this shall call on\nthe name of Jacob; and this shall write with his hand, The Lord's\nand entitle, In the name of Israel. \n 6 Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his redeemer,\nthe Lord of Hosts; I am the \ufb01rst, and I, am the last; and beside\nme there is no God. \n 7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall tell it, and state it in\norder for me? since I set up the people of old time? and things\nwhich are coming, and things which shall come, let them tell it to\nthem. \n 8 Shudder not, and fear not: have I not caused thee to hear,\nfrom that time, and told it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there\na God beside me? and there is no Rock: I know not (any). \n 9 They that form a graven image are all of them waste; and\ntheir desirable things shall not profit; and their witnesses, they\nsee not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. \n 10 Who hath formed a god, and molten a graven, image, to no\nprofit? \n 11 Behold, all his company shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen,\nthey are of men; they shall all be gathered together, they\nshall stand up; they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together. \n \n \n\n \n XLIV. 1 But now hear, Jacob my servant, and Israel,\nwhom I chose (out). \n 2 Thus said the Lord God who made thee, and he that formed\nthee from the womb, Thou shalt yet be helped: fear not, my\nservant Jacob, and my beloved Israel whom I chose (out); \n 3 For I will give water in thirst to them that walk in a waterless\nplace; I will put my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessings upon thy children, \n 4 And they shall rise up as grass among water, and as a willow\nby the side of a \ufb02owing water. \n 5 This one shall say, I am God's, and this shall speak in the\nname of Jacob; and another writeth, I am God's; upon the name\nof Israel. \n 6 Thus saith God, the King of Israel, and his deliverer, God\nof Hosts; I am \ufb01rst, and I am hereafter; except me there is no\nGod. \n 7 Who is as I am? let him stand, let him call, and make ready\nfor me, since I made man for everlasting; and let them declare\nto you the coming things before they come. \n 8 Hide not yourselves; did ye not give ear from the beginning,\nand I declared it to you? ye are witnesses, whether there be a God\nbeside me; and they were not, at that time. \n 9 They that mould images, and that grave, are all of them\nvain; they that make their own delights, which shall not help\nthem; but they shall be ashamed, \n 10 All they that mould a god, and grave unprofitable things: \n 11 And all are withered from whence they sprang, and (are)\ndumb from among men; let them all be gathered together, and\nthey shall stand together, let them be turned backward and be\nashamed together. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 The craftsman in iron (hath) an adze, and worketh in the\ncoals, and formeth it with hammers, with the arm of his strehgth\nmoreover he is hungry, and there is no strength: he drinketh no\nwater, and is faint. \n 13 The craftsman in wood stretcheth out a line, he marketh it\nwith a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and marketh it out with\nthe compass; and maketh it like the \ufb01gure of a man, like the\nbeauty of mankind: to dwell in a house. \n 14 He will hew him down cedars, and taketh ilex and oak, and\nstrengtheneth for himself (one) among the trees of the forest: he\nplanteth a pine, and the rain maketh it great. \n 15 And it shall be for man for burning: and he taketh of them,\nand warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,\nhe fashioneth a god, and boweth himself; he maketh it a grav\nimage, and falleth down thereto. \n 16 He burneth half thereof in the \ufb01re: with half thereof he\neateth \ufb02esh: he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth\nhimself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen \ufb01re: \n 17 And the remainder thereof he maketh to be a god, to be\nhis (graven) image 3 he falleth down unto it, and boweth himself,\nand prayeth unto it, saith, Deliver me 3 for thou (art) my god. \n 18 They know not, and they discern not; for one hath daubed\ntheir eyes, that they see not, and their hearts, that they\nconsider not. \n 19 And he recalleth it not to his heart, and there is no knowledge,\nand no discernment to say, I have burned half of it in the\n\ufb01re, and also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof: I have\nroasted \ufb02esh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof\nan abomination? shall I bow myself to the produce of a tree? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 For the craftsman sharpeneth iron, with an adze he\nfashioneth it, and boreth it with a gimlet, worketh it with the arm\nof his strength; and he shall be hungry, and shall be faint, and\nnot drink water: \n 13 The craftsman when he hath chosen a piece of wood, setteth\nit up by measure, and \ufb01tteth it together with glue; he maketh it\nlike the form of a great man, and like the goodliness of man, to set\nit up in a house: \n 14 He cutteth wood out of the forest which the Lord planted,\nand the rain made it to grow, \n 15 That it may be for men for burning; and he taketh thereof,\nand is warmed; and they burn it, and bake loaves upon it; and\nthe rest he maketh into gods, and they worship them. \n 16 Whereof he burneth half in the \ufb01re (and they burn them,\nand bake loaves upon them), and roasteth meat upon it, and eateth,\nand is \ufb01lled: and when he is warmed, he saith, Sweet is it to me\nthat I am warmed, and have seen \ufb01re. \n 17 But the rest of it he maketh a graven god, and worshippeth\nit, and prayeth to it, saying, Deliver me, for thou art my god. \n 18 They have not learnt to have understanding, for they are\ndarkened, from seeing with their eyes, and understandingwith their\nheart. \n 19 And he considereth not in his heart, nor pondereth in\nhis soul, nor perceiveth with his understanding, that he hath\nburned half thereof in the fire, and baked loaves upon the ashes\nthereof, and roasted meat, and eaten; and made the rest of it into\nan abomination, and they worship it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 20 He is a feeder on ashes; a deluded heart hath turned him\naside, and he delivereth not his soul, nor saith, Is there not a lie\nin my right hand? \n 21 Remember these things, O Jacob; and Israel, for thou art\nmy servant; I have formed thee, thou art my servant: Israel,\nthou shalt not be forgotten of me. \n 22 I have blotted out, as a mist, thy rebellions, and as\na cloud thy sins; return unto me; for I have redeemed\nthee. \n 23 Sing, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it; shout, ye\nlowest parts of the earth; break forth, ye mountains, into\nsinging; the forest, and every tree therein; for the Lord hath\nredeemed Jacob, and will beautify himself in Israel. \n 24 Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed\nthee from the womb, I am the Lord, that maketh all things; that\nstretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth forth the earth:\nwho was with me? \n 25 That shattereth the signs of the praters, and diviners he\nwill madden; that tumeth wise men backward, and maketh their\nknowledge foolish: \n 26 That setteth up the word of his servant, and fulfilleth the\ncounsel of his messengers: that saith to Jerusalem, She shall be\ninhabited, and to the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and\nI will set up the wastes thereof: \n 27 That saith to the deep, Be wasted, I will dry up thy\nrivers: \n 28 That saith to Cyrus, My shepherd, and all my pleasure\nshall he fulfil; 3 and saying to Jerusalem, She shall be built, and\na temple shall be founded. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 20 Learn ye that their heart is ashes, and they wander out of\nthe way, and no one can deliver his soul; see, ye will not say,\nThere is a lie in my right hand. \n 21 Remember this, Jacob, and Israel, for thou art my\nservant; I formed thee for my servant, and thou, Israel, forget\nnot me. \n 22 For behold, I have blotted out thy transgressions as a cloud,\nand thy sins as darkness; turn thou to me, and I will redeem\nthee. \n 23 Rejoice, ye heavens, for God hath had mercy upon Israel:\nsound the dumpet, ye foundations of the earth; shout, ye mountains,\nin joy, ye hills, and all the trees upon them; for the Lord\nhath had mercy on Jacob; and Israel shall be glorified. \n 24 Thus saith the Lord, that redeemeth thee, and formeth\nthee from the womb, I am the Lord, that accbmplish this; I alone\nstretched out the heaven, and established the earth. \n 25 Who else scattered the signs of ventriloquists, and divinations\nfrom the heart? turning wise men backward, and making\nfoolish their counsel? \n 26. And establishing the words of his servants, and making true\nthe counsel of his messengers? he that saith to Jerusalem, Thou\nshalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built;\nand her desolate places shall arise: \n 27 That saith to the deep, Thou shalt be made desolate, and\nI will dry up thy rivers: \n 28 That biddeth Cyrus be wise, and saith, He shall perform all\nmy desires; that saith Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and\nI will lay the foundation of my holy house. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XLV. 1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, of\nwhose right hand I have taken hold, to bring down nations before\nhim, and I will loose the loins of kings, to loose before his face\ntwo-leaved doors, and gates shall not be shut: \n 2 I will go before thee, and make swelling ground a\nI will break in pieces doors of brass, and cut in sunder bars of\niron: \n 3 And I will give thee treasures of darkness, and hidden things\nof secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the Lord, which\ncall thee by thy name, the God of Israel. \n 4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel's mine elect, therefore\nI have called thee by thy name: I have named thee\nhonourably, and thou hast not known me. \n 5 I am the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God.\nbeside me: I have girded thee, and thou hast not known me. \n 6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from\nthe setting thereof, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord,\nand there is none else, \n 7 That form light, and create darkness, that make peace, and\ncreate evil: I am the Lord, that do all these things \n 8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour\ndown righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth\nsalvation, and let her cause righteousness to spring up together:\nI the Lord have created it. \n 9, Ah, he that. striveth with him that formed him ! a potsherd\namong potsherds of the ground. Shall the clay say to the potter,\nWhat makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands! \n \n \n \n\n \n XLV. 1 Thus saith the Lord God to my anointed, Cyrus,\non whose right hand <I have> taken hold, for nations to submit\nbefore him; and I will shatter the strength of kings, I will open\ndoors before him, and cities shall not be shut \n 2 I will go before him, and will level mountains, will break\ndown doors of brass, and will snap asunder bolts of iron \n 3 And I will give thee treasures of darkness, I will open to\nthee hidden (treasures) <unseen>, that thou mayest learn\nI am the Lord that call thy name, the God of Israel. \n 4 For my servant Jacob's sake, and Israel's whom I have\nchosen, I will call thee by thy name, and will receive thee; but\nthou knewest not me. \n 5 For I am the Lord God, and there is no other God beside\nme; and they knew me not. \n 6 That they from the rising of the sun, and they from the\ngoing down (thereof) may learn, that there is none beside me\nand that I am the Lord God, and there is none other, \n 7 I, that establish light, and make darkness, that make peace,\nand create evils: I am the Lord God that doeth all these things. \n 8 Let the heaven from above rejoice, and let the clouds shower\ndown righteousness: let the earth bring forth and make mercy to\nspring up, and let righteousness spring up together. I am the\nLord that created thee. \n 9 What better things have I set up, as clay of the potter?\nshall the plowman plow the earth? shall the clay say to the\npotter, What doest thou, for thou workest not, neither hast\nhands? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 Ah, he that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to\na woman, Wherewith travailest thou? \n 11 Thus saith the Lord, the Holy one of Israel, and he that\nformed him; Ask me of coming things concerning my sons, and\ncommand me concerning the work of my hands. \n 12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, my\nhands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I\ncommanded. \n 13 I have roused him up in righteousness, and I will level all\nhis ways: he shall build my city, and he shall send forthl my\ncaptivity, not for hire, and not for a present, saith the Lord of\nhosts. \n 14 Thus saith the Lord, The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise\nof Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass\nover unto thee, and becOme thine; they shall go after thee, in\nchains shall they pass over, and they shall bow down to thee, they\nshall pray unto thee: Only in thee is God, and there is none else,\nno God at all. \n 15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,\nSaviour. \n 16 They are ashamed and also confounded, all of them; the\ncraftsmen of idols are gone into confusion together. \n 17 Israel is saved in the Lord with everlasting salvation: ye\nshall not be ashamed nor confounded to all eternity. \n 18 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; (he is\nGod:) that formed the earth, and made it: he set it in order; he\ncreated it not a waste, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the\nLord, and there is none else. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 He that saith to the father, What wilt thou beget? or to the\nmother, Where wilt thou travail ? \n 11 For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, that\nmaketh the things to come; Ask ye me concerning my sons and\nconcerning my daughters, and concerning the works of my hands\ngive me a charge. \n 12 I made the earth, and man upon it; I with my hand\nestablished the heaven, I commanded all the stars. \n 13 I raised him up with righteousness, and all his ways (shall\nbe) straight; he shall build my city, and shall turn the captivity\nof my people, not with ransom, nor with gifts, saith the Lord of\nhosts. \n 14 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Egypt is weary, and the\nmerchandise of the Ethiopians: and the men of Saba, men of\nlofty stature, shall pass over unto thee, and shall slaves unto\nthee, and shall follow behind thee, bound with manacles, and\nworship before thee, and in thee shall they pray: for in thee is\nGod, and they shall say, There is no God beside thee. \n 15 For thou an God, and we knew it not, O God of Israel,\nSaviour. \n 16 All they that resist him shall be ashamed, and turned back-\nward, and shall walk in shame. Be ye made new toward me, ye\nisles. \n 17 Israel is being saved by the Lord with an everlasting\nsalvation; they shall not be ashamed, nor be turned backward\nfor ever. \n 18 Thus saith the Lord, that made the heaven:\u2014he is the\nthat showed forth the earth and made it, he himself set its\nbounds; he made it not for a void, but to be inhabited: I am,\nand there is none beside. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 19 I have not, spoken in secret, in a place of the land of\ndarkness 3 I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me, (as in)\na waste: I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that\nare right. \n 20 Assemble yourselves, and come; draw near together, ye\nescaped of the nations; they know not, that carry the wood of\ntheir graven image, and pray unto a God that cannot save. \n 21 Declare ye, and bring near: yea, let them take counsel\ntogether; who hath caused this to be heard from of old, hath\ndeclared it from that time? Is it not I, the Lord? and there is\nno God else beside me: a righteous God and a Saviour; there is\nnone except me. \n 22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth\nfor I am God, and there is none else. \n 23 I have sworn by myself, a word is gone forth from a mouth\nof righteousness, and it shall not return, that unto me every knee\nshall bow, every tongue shall swear. \n 24 Only in the Lord, saith one, have I righteousness and\nstrength; unto him shall one come, and all that were inflamed\nagainst him shall be ashamed. \n 25 In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be held righteous,\nand boast themselves. \n XLVI. 1 Bel croucheth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols\nare for beast and cattle; the things ye carried are borne heavily,\na burden to the weary. \n \n \n\n \n 19 I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the\nearth ; -\u1fd9 said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye a vain thing; \u0399\nam, I am one that speaketh righteousness, and declareth truth. \n 20 Be gathered together, and come ye, take counsel together,\nye that are being saved from among the nations. They had not\nlearnt, they that lift up the wood, their graving, and pray as to\ngods that save not. \n 21 If they do declare it, let them draw near, that they may\nlearn together, who made these things to be heard, from the\nbeginning: then was it declared unto you, I am God, and there\nis none other but me; righteous and a saviour, there is none\nexcept me. , \n 22 Turn ye to me, and ye shall be saved, ye that are from the\n_ end of the earth ; I am God, and there is none other. \n 23 By myself I swear, that righteousness shall go forth from\nmy mouth; my words shall not be turned back; that unto me\nshall every knee bow, and every tongue shall swear by God, \n 24 Saying, Righteousness and glory shall come unto him, and\nall they that separate themselves shall be ashamed. \u2019 \u2019 \n 25 From the Lord shall men be justi\ufb01ed, and in God shall all\nthe seed of the children of Israel be glori\ufb01ed; \n XLVI. I Fallen is Bel, crushed into pieces is Dagon: their\ngraven images were for wild beasts, and beasts of burden; lift\nthem up bound as a load for one that is weary and hungry, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 They stoop, they crouch together; they cannot deliver the\nburden, their soul is gone into captivity. \n 3 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of\nthe house of Israel: which are heavily borne from the womb,\nwhich are carried from the bosom: \n 4 And to old age I am he, and to grey hairs I will support; I\nhave made, and I will carry; and I will support, and will deliver\nyou. \n 5 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare\nme, and we shall be like? \n 6 They that pour forth gold from the bag, and weigh silver\nwith the balance; they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god:\nthey fall down, yea, they bow themselves. \n 7 They lift him upon the shoulder; they support him, they set\nhim in his place, and he standeth; he moveth not from his place;\nyea, one shall cry unto him, and he shall not answer, he shall not\nsave him from his distress, \n 8 Remember this, and stand \ufb01rm; recall it to mind, O ye rebels. \n 9 Remember the \ufb01rst things of old: for I am God, and there\nis none else; God, and there is none like me. \n 10 Declaring the after-things from the beginning, and from of\nold what is not done; saying, My purpose shall stand, and I will\ndo all my pleasure: \n 11 Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of his counsel\nfrom a far country: yea, I have spoken, yea, I will bring it to\npass: I have purposed it, I will also do it. \n 12 Hearken unto me, ye stout of heart, that are far from\nrighteousness; \n 13 I bring near my righteousness: it shall not be far off, and\nmy salvation shall not tarry; and I will give in Zion salvation, for\nIsrael my glory. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 And enfeebled, without strength also; who shall not be able\nto be saved from war, but themselves were led captive. \n 3 Hear ye me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel,\nthat are carried from the womb, and reared up from a child. \n 4 Until old age I am, and until ye grow old, I am; I bear\nwith you, I made you, and I will let you (go) free, I will take you\nup, and will save you. \n 5 To whom have ye likened me? See ye, deal cunningly, ye\nthat are led astray: \n 6 Ye that contribute gold out of a bag, and silver by balance\nthey will set it in a scale, and when they have hired a goldsmith,\nthey make works of their hands, and bow down, and worship\nthem. \n 7 They lift it upon the shoulders, and walk; and if they set it\ndown, it remaineth in his place, it shall not stir; and whosoever\ncalleth unto him, he shall not hear, he shall not save him from\nevils. \n 8 Remember this, and lament; repent, ye that have gone\nV astray, turn with your heart. \n 9 And remember the former things from eternity; for I am\nGod, (and there is none beside me :) \n 10 Declaring the last things before they come to pass, and\ntherewith they are fulfilled; and I said, All my counsel shall\nsand, and all that I have counselled will I do. \n 11 Calling a fowl of the air from the East, and from a land\nafar off them concerning whom I have counselled; I spake, and\nled him, I created and made, I led him, and made his way plain: \n 12 Hearken to me, ye that have lost your heart, ye that are\nfar from righteousness. \n 13 I have brought near my righteousness, and the salvation\nthat cometh from me will I not delay: I have given salvation in\nZion to Israel for a glorifying. \n \n \n\n \n XLVII. I Come down, and sit in the dust, O Virgin\ndaughter of Babylon: sit on the earth, there is no throne, O\ndaughter of the Chaldaeans; for thou shaltno more be (one)\nthey call tender and delicate. \n 2 Take the millstones, and grind meal; take off thy veil, lift\nup thy train, uncover the leg, pass through rivers. \n 3 Let thy nakedness be uncovered, yea, let thy shame be seen;\nI will take vengeance, and I will not meet man. \n 4 Our redeemer, the LORD of Hosts is his name, the Holy One\nof Israel. \n 5 Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the\nChaldaeans; for thou shalt no more be (one) they call lady of\nkingdoms. \n 6 I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance,\nand gave them into thy hand; thou didst shew them no mercy;\nupon the aged thou didst make thy yoke exceeding heavy. \n 7 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: until thou didst\nnot lay these things to thine heart, thou didst not remember the\nlatter end of it. \n 8 And now hear this, thou given to pleasure, that sittest\nsecurely, that sayest in thine heart, I and none else beside: I\nshall not sit a widow. neither shall I know bereavement. \n 9 And these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one\nday, bereavement, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in\nfull measure, for the multitude of thy \u2019orceries, for the exceeding\nnumber of thy spells. \n 10 And thou hast been secure in thine evil: thou hast said,\nThere is none that seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it\nhath turned thee aside; and thou hast said in thine heart, I, and\nnone else beside. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n XLVII. 1 Come down, sit upon the ground, virgin daughter\nof Babylon; enter into the darkness, daughter of the Chaldaeans,\nfor no longer shalt thou. be any more called tender and delicate. \n 2 Take a millstone, grind meal, take off thy covering, uncover\nthy grey hairs, make bare the legs, pass through rivers. \n 3 Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproaches shall appear;\nI will do justice upon thee, no longer will I deliver thee over\nunto men, \n 4 Saith thy deliverer, the Lord of Hosts, his name is the Holy\nOne of Israel. \n 5 Sit down in amazement, enter into the darkness, daughter of\nthe Chaldaeans: no longer shalt thou be called the strength of a kingdom. \n 6 I was provoked at my people, thou defiledst mine inheritance:\nI gave (them) into thine hand, and thou showedst them no mercy;\nthou didst make the yoke of the elder very heavy. \n 7 And thou saidst, I shall be a princess for ever; thou per-\nceivedst not this in thy heart, neither didst remember the last\nthings. \n 8 But now hear this, delicate one, that sittest, that art confident\nthat sayest in thine heart, I am, and there is none other; I shall\nnot sit as a widow, nor shall I come to know bereavement. \n 9 But now shall there come suddenly these two things in one\nday, childlessness and widowhood shall come suddenly upon thee\nin thy witchcraft; in the strength of thy enchantments exceeding\ngreatly, \n 10 In the hope of thy wickedness; for thou saidst, I am, and\nthere is no other: learn thou, that the understanding of these\nthings and thy harlotry shall be thy shame: and thou saidst in\nthine heart, I am, and there is no other. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And evil shall come upon thee; thou shalt not know the\ndawning thereof; and ruin shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be\nable to avert it: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly,\n(which) thou shalt not know. \n 12 Stand forth, I pray, with thy spells, and with the multitude\nof thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth:\nperadventure thou wilt be able to profit, peradventure thou wilt\nstrike terror. \n 13 Thou art wearied with the multitude of thy counsels: let\nthem, I pray thee, stand forth and save thee\u2014they who\nthe heavens, who gaze on the stars, who make known at the new\nmoons\u2014from what shall come upon \n 14 Behold, they are become as stubble, \ufb01re hath burned them;\nthey shall not deliver their soul from the hand of the \ufb02ame; it is\nno coal to be warm, \ufb01re to sit before. \n 15 Thus are the things to thee wherein thou hast laboured:\nthy traffickers from thy youth go astray everyone his own way:\nthere is none that saveth thee. \n XLVIII. 1 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called\nby the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of\nJudah; which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention\nof the God of Israel, not in truth, and not in righteousness. \n 2 For they are called of the holy city, and lean upon the God\nof Israel: the Lord of Hosts is his name. \n 3 I have declared the \ufb01rst things from that time; and they\nwent forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I wrought\nsuddenly, and they came to pass. \n 4 Because I knew that thou art hard, and thy neck is an iron\nsinew, and thy brow brass: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And there shall come upon thee destruction, and thou\nshalt not perceive it; a pit, and thou shalt fall into it: and there\nshall come misery upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be\nclear of it: and there shall come destruction suddenly upon thee,\nand thou shalt not perceive it. \n 12 Stand now in thine enchantments, and thy abundant witch-\ncraft, which thou didst learn from thy youth, (to see) if thou\ncanst be helped: \n 13 Thou hast grown weary in thy counsels: let the astrologers\nof the heaven stand and save thee; let them who look on the\nstars declare to thee what is purposed to come upon thee. \n 14 Behold, all shall be burnt up as brushwood upon a \ufb01re, and\nthey shall not deliver their soul from the \ufb02ame; since thou hast\ncoals of \ufb01re, sit thereon. \n 15 These shall be thy help: thou didst weary thyself in thy\ntraffic from thy youth: each went astray by himself; but for thee\nshall be no salvation. \n XLVIII. 1 Hear ye this, house of Jacob, ye that are called\nby the name of Israel, and that have come forth from Judah, ye\nthat swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, calling him to\nmind not with truth, nor with righteousness, \n 2 And holding by the name of the holy city, and staying yourselves\nupon the God of Israel: the Lord of Hosts is his name. \n 3 Still haveI-declared the former things, and out of my mouth\nwent they forth, and came to be heard: I did them suddenly, and\nthey came to pass. \n 4 I perceive that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron\nsinew, and thy brow brass. \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Therefore I have from that time declared it to thee 3 before\nit came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine\nidol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten\nimage, hath commanded them. \n 6 Thou hast heard 3 see it all: and ye, will not ye declare it?\nI have caused thee to hear new things from now, and things\nreserved, and thou didst not know them. \u2018 \n 7 They are created now, and not from that time 3 and before\nto-day, and thou heardest them not 3 lest thou shouldest say,-\nBehold, I knew them. \n 8 Nay, thou hast not heard 3 nay, thou hast not known 3 nay,\nfrom that. time thine ear opened not 3 for I knew that thou\ngigs; (33:1 very treacherously, and wast\u2018 called a rebel from\nthe womb. \n 9 For my name\u2019s sake I defer mine anger, and for my praise\ndo I refrain it for thee, that I cut thee not off. \n 10 Behold, I have re\ufb01ned thee, and not as silver; I have\nchosen thee in the furnace of affliction. \n 11 For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do (it) 3 for\nhow is it profaned? and I will not give my glory unto another. \n 12 Hearken unto me, Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he,\nI am the \ufb01rst, I also am the last. \n 13 Mine hand also laid the foundation of the earth, and my\n\u2019 right hand spread out the heavens; I call unto them, they will\nstand up together. \u0387 \n 14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them\ndeclared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do\nlgiausre on Babylon, and his arm (shall be) on the\nChaldaeans. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 And I declared to thee the things of old, before they came\nupon thee; I made it to be heard of thee, lest thou shouldest\nsay, Mine idols have done it, and say, The graven and the\nmolten images have commanded me. \n 6 Ye have heard all, and ye perceived not; but I have also\nmade to be heard of thee the new things from henceforth which\nshall come to pass; and thou saidst not, \n 7 Now come they to pass, and not long since, and not in\nformer days didst thou hear of them; lest thou shouldest say,\nYea, I perceive them. \n 8 Thou didst neither perceive nor know, nor did I open thine\nears from the beginning; for I perceived that thou wouldest\nutterly set them at nought, and thou shalt be called a transgressor\neven from the womb. \n 9 For my name's sake will I show thee my wrath, and my\nglorious deeds will I bring upon thee, that I may not utterly\ndestroy thee. \n 10 Behold, I have sold thee, not for silver; and I delivered\nthee out of the furnace of beggary. \n 11 For mine own sake will I do it unto thee; for my name is\npolluted, and my glory will I not give to another. \n 12 Hear me, Jacob, and Israel, whom I call; I am \ufb01rst, and I\nam for everlasting: \n 13 And my hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my\nright hand established the heaven; I will call them, and they\nshall stand together. \n 14 And all shall be gathered together, and shall hearken.\nWho declared these things unto them? Because I loved thee,\nI did this upon Babylon, thy will, to destroy the seed of the\nChaldaeans. \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 I, I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought\nhim, and he shall make his way prosperous. \n 16 Draw near unto me, hear ye this; not from the beginning\nhave I spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I\nand now the Lord God, and his spirit, hath sent me. \n 17 Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of\nIsrael: I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit.\nwhich leadeth thee by the way thou shouldest walk. \n 18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! and\n\u2019 thy peace had been as the river, and thy righteousness as the\nwaves of the seal \n 19 And thy seed had been as the sand, and the offspring of\nthy bowels like the grains thereof: his name should not be cut off\nnor destroyed before me. \n 20 Go ye forth of Babylon, \ufb02ee ye from the Chaldaeans; with\na voice of singing declare ye, make this heard, send it forth to\nthe end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his\nservant Jacob. \n 21. And they thirsted not in the deserts (where) he made them\ngo; he caused the waters to \ufb02ow out Of the rock for them; and\nhe clave the rock, and the waters gushed out. \n 22 There is no peace, saith the Lord, to the wicked. \n XLIX. 1 Hearken, ye isles, to me, and listen, ye peoples,\nfrom afar; the Lord hath called me from the. womb; from the\nbowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. \n 2 And he made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow\nof his hand he hid me; and set me for a polished arrow; in his\nquiver be concealed me, \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 I spake, I called him, led him, and made his way prosperous. \n 16 Draw near unto me, and hear ye this; from the beginning\nhave I not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the earth;\nwhen it came to pass, there was I, and now the Lord hath sent\nme, and his spirit. \n 17 Thus saith the Lord, thy deliverer, the Holy One of Israel:\n<I am thy God,> I have shown to thee, that thou mayest\nway wherein thou shalt walk. \n 18 And if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments, thy\npeace should have been made as a river, and thy righteousness\nas a wave of the sea; \n 19 And thy seed should have becoine as sand, and the off\nspring of thy womb as the dust of the earth; nor shalt thou now\nbe utterly destroyed, nor shall thy name perish before me. \n 20 Come thou forth from Babylon, \ufb02eeing from the Chaldaeans;\nproclaim ye the voice of joy, and let this be heard,\nreport it to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath\ndelivered his people Jacob. \n 21 And if they be thirsty, he will bring them through the\nwilderness, he will bring water for them out of a rock; a rock\nshall be cleft, and water shall \ufb02ow, and my people shall drink. \n 22 There is no rejoicing, saith the Lord, for the wicked. \n XLIX. 1 Hearken to me, ye isles, and attend to me, ye\nnations; after long time shall it stand, saith the Lord. From my\n\u2019s womb he called my name, \n 2 And set my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shelter\nof his hand he hid me; he made me as a chosen arrow, and in\nhis quiver he sheltered me, \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom\nI will glorify myself. \n 4 And I said, I have laboured in vain, for waste and vanity\nhave I consumed my strength; surely my judgment is with the\nLord, and my recompense with my God. \n 5 And now, saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb\nfor a servant to him, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel\nbe not swept away\u2014and I shall be honoured in the eyes of the\nLord, and my God shall be my\u2014 \n 6 And he said, It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my\nservant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved\nof Israel; and I will give thee for a light of the nations,\nthat my salvation may be to the end of the earth. \n 7 Thus saith the Lord, the redeemer of Israel, and his Holy\nOne, to the despised of soul, to the abhorred of a nation, to a\nservant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they\nshall bow themselves; for the sake of the LORD, that is faithful;\nthe Holy One of Israel, and he hath chosen thee. \n 8 Thus saith the Lord, In a time of favour have I answered\nthee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will\npreserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to\nraise up the land, to allot the desolate allotments, \n 9 Saying tothe captives, Go forth; to them that are in darkness,\nShow yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and on all\nbare heights is their feeding place. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 And said unto me, Thou art my bondman, Israel, and in\nthee will I, be glorified. \n 4 And I said, Vainly have I laboured, in vain and for nought\nhave I given my strength; therefore my judgment is from the,\nLord, and my toil before my. God. \n 5 And now thus saith the Lord, that formed me from the\nwomb his bondslave, to gather together Jacob and Israel unto\nhim, I will be gathered, and will be glorified before the Lord, and\nmy God shall be my strength. \n 6 And he said to me, It is a great, thing for thee, that thou\nmayest be called my servant, that thou mayest set up the tribes\nof Jacob, and turn again the dispersion of Israel; behold. I have\nset thee for a light of nations, that thou mayest be for salvation\nunto the end of the earth. \n 7 Thus saith the Lord thy deliverer, the God of Israel,\nSanctify him that lightly esteemeth his soul, him that is held\nabominable by the nations, the slaves of the rulers; kings shall\nsee him, and rulers shall rise up and worship him for the\nLord's sake: for faithful is the Holy One of Israel, and I chose\nthee. \n 8 Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time I heard thee,\nand in a day of salvation I helped thee, and gave thee for a\ncovenant of nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to\ninherit desolate heritages, \n 9 Saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth, and (bidding)\nthem that are in darkness be revealed. And in all the ways they\nshall feed, and in all paths is their pasture. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; and the burning sand\nand sun shall not smite them; for he that hath mercy on them\nshall lead them, and by springs of water shall he guide them. \n 11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways\nshall be exalted. \n 12 Behold, these shall come from afar; and behold, these\nfrom the north and from the sea; and these from the land of\nSinim. \n 13 Sing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth; and break forth into,\nsinging, ye mountains; for the Lord hath comforted his people,\nand will have mercy upon his afflicted. \n 14 And Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord\nhath forgotten me. \n 15 Will a woman forget her suckling, not to have compassion\non the son of her womb? yea, these may forget, and I will not\nforget thee. \n 16 Behold, upon both palms have I engraved thee; thy walls\nare continually before me. \n 17 Thy sons make haste; thy destroyers and they that made\nthee waste shall go forth of thee. \n 18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; they all are\ngathered together, they come to thee. As I live, saith the Lord,\nthou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament,\nand gird them on (thee) like a bride. \n 19 For (as for) thy ruins and thy waste places, and the land of\nthy destruction, surely now shalt thou be too strait for the\ninhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. \n 29 The sons of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears,\nThe place is too strait for me: give place to me, and I will\ndwell. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 10 They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall burning heat\nnor sun smite them; but he that hath mercy on them shall comfort\nthem, and lead them through springs of waters: \n 11 And I will turn every mountain into a way, and every path\ninto a pasture for them. \n 12 Behold, these come from far, these from the north, and\nthese from the sea, and others from the land of the Persians. \n 13 Rejoice, ye heavens, and let the earth exult: let the\nmountains break out in joy, because God hath had mercy on his\npeople, and hath comforted the humble among his people. \n 14 But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me; and, The Lord\nhath forgotten me. \n 15 Will a mother forget her little child, not to have mercy on\nthe offspring of her womb? but even if a woman should forget\nthis, yet will I not forget thee, saith the Lord. \n 16 Behold, I have painted thy walls upon my hands, and thou\nart alway before me. \n 17 And sdon shalt thou be built by them, by whom thou\nwast destroyed, and they that laid thee desolate shall come forth\nfrom thee. \n 18 Lift up thine eyes around, and look on (them) all; behold,\nthey were gathered together, and came to thee; as I live, saith\nthe Lord, thou shalt clothe thee with them all, and shalt put them\non thee as a bride's adornment. \n 19 For thy desolate, and destroyed, and fallen places, shall.\nnow be narrow by reason of thine inhabitants; and they that\nswallowed thee up shall be far removed from thee. \n 20 For thy sons, whom thou hast lost, shall say in thine ears,\nThe place is (too) narrow for me: make a place for me, that\nI may dwell in it. \n \n \n \n\n \n 21 And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me\nthese, and I was bereaved and barren, an exile, and outcast? and\nwho hath nourished up these? Behold, I was left alone; these,\nwhere were they? \n 22 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand\ntoward the nations, and set up my standard to the peoples; and\nthey shall bring thy sons in the bosom, and thy daughters shall\nbe carried on the shoulder, \n 23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their princesses\nthy nursing mothers: they shall bow themselves to thee face to\nthe earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know\nthat I am the Lord, on whom they that wait shall not be\nashamed. \n 24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captive of\nthe righteous delivered? \n 25 For thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty\nshall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be\ndelivered, and I will contend with him that contendeth with\nthee, and I will save thy children. \n 26 And I will make them that oppress thee to eat their own\n\ufb02esh, and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with\nnew wine; and all \ufb02esh shall know that I the Lord am thy\nsaviour and thy redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. \n L. 1 Thus saith the Lord, Where is the bill of your mother's\ndivorcement, wherewith I have put her away? Or which of my\ncreditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your\niniquities were ye sold, and for your rebellions was your mother\nput away. \n \n \n\n \n 21 And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who begat me these?\nYea, I am childless and a widow, but who hath brought up these\nfor me? I have been left alone, but where had I these? \n 22 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, Iraise up towards the nations\nmy hand, and to the isles will I lift up my signal, and they shall\nbring thy sons in their bosom, and shall lift thy daughters upon\nthy shoulders, \n 23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and the princesses\nthy nurses; they shall worship before thee on the face of the\nearth, and shall lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt learn\nthat I am the Lord, and thou shalt not be ashamed. \n 24 Shall one take spoils from a giant? and if one take a captive\nunlawfully, shall he be saved? \n 25 Thus saith the Lord, If one take a giant captive, he\nshall take spoils, and taking them from a mighty man he shall\nbe saved; and I will judge thy cause, and I will deliver\nthy sons: \n 26 And they that afflict thee shall eat their own \ufb02esh, and\nshall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken;\nand all \ufb02esh shall perceive that I am he that hath delivered thee,\nand that layeth hold upon the strength of Jacob. \n L. 1 Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind is the bill of your\nmother's divorcement, wherewith I sent her away? or to what\ndebtor have I sold you? Behold, for your sins were ye sold,\nand for your transgressions sent I your mother away. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Why came I, and there was no man? Whycalled I, and.\nthere was none that answered? Is my hand utterly too shortened\nto redeem? and is there no power in me to deliver? Behold, at\nmy rebuke I will dry up the sea, I will make rivers a wilderness;\ntheir \ufb01sh stink for want of water, and die with thirst. \n 3 I will clothe the heavens in blackness, and make sackcloth\ntheir covering. \n 4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of disciples, that I\nshould know how to sustain the weary with a word ; he wakeneth\nevery morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as disciples. \n 5 The Lord GOD hath opened me an ear, and I resisted not,.I\ndrew not back. \n 6 I gave my back to smiters, and my cheeks to them that\nplucked 96 the hair; I hid not my face from ignominies and\nspitting. \u03b8 . \n 7 And the Lord GOD will help \u2018me; therefore I am not\nconfounded ; therefore have I set my face like a \ufb02int, and I know\nthat I shall not be ashamed. \n 8 Near is he that justi\ufb01eth me: who will contend with me?\nlet us stand forth together ; who is the master of my judgment?\nlet him come near to me. \n 9 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall\ncondemn me? 10, they all shall wear out like a garment; the\nmoth shall eat them. \n 10 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that hearkeneth\u2018\nto the voice of his servant? He that walketh in darkness, and\nhath no light? let him trust in the name of the Loan, and lean\n\u1f36 upon his God. \n \n \n\n \n 2 Why was it that I came, and there was no man? I called,\nand he listened not? Is not my hand strong to deliver? or have\nI not strength to rescue? behold, by my threat I will make the\nsea a desolation, and make rivers desolate, and their \ufb01shes shall\nbe dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst. \n 3 And I will clothe the heaven with darkness, and will make\nhis shroud as sackcloth. \n 4 The Lord giveth me a tongue of instruction, to perceive\nin season when I must speak a word; he gave me in the morning,\nhe added unto me an ear to hear, \n 5 And the instruction of the Lord openeth mine ears, and\nI am not disobedient, nor gainsay (it). \n 6 I have given my back for scourges, and my cheeks for\nblows, and my face I turned not away from the shame of\nspittings, \n 7 And the Lord became my helper; therefore I turned not\nback; but I set my face as a solid rock, and I perceived that\nI should not be ashamed. \n 8 For he draweth near that justified me: who is he that\ncontendeth with me; let him stand up against me together; yea,\nwho is he that contendeth with me? let him draw near to me. \n 9 Behold, the Lord helpeth me: who shall harm me? behold,\nall ye. shall wax old \u2019a garment, and as it were a moth shall\neat you up. \n 10 Who among you is he that feareth the Lord? let him listen\nto the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness, they have\nno light, trust ye in the name of the Lord, and stay yourselves\nupon God. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 Behold, all ye that kindle a \ufb01re, that gird yourselves with\n\ufb01rebrands; walk amid the light of your \ufb01re, and amid the brands\nthat ye have kindled. From my hand is this for you; ye shall\nlie down in pain. \n LI. 1 Hearken to me, ye that pursue righteousness, ye that\nseek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to\nthe hole of the pit whence ye are digged. \n 2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare\nyou; for I called him, being one, and blessed him, and\nincreased him. \n 3 For the Lord hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all\nher waste places; and he hath made her wilderness like Eden,\nand her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness\nshall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of song. \n 4 Listen unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my\nnation; for a law shall go forth from me, and I will settle my\njudgment for a light of the peoples. \n 5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and\nmine arms shall, judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me,\nand on mine arm shall they trust. \n 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth\nbeneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the\nearth shall wear out like a garment, and they that dwell therein\nshall die as in like manner; but my salvation shall be for ever,\nand my righteousness shall not be dismayed. \n 7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, \u2019a people in\nwhose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of (weak) men,\nand be ye not dismayed at their revilings. \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 Behold, all ye kindle a \ufb01re, and strengthen a \ufb02ame; walk\nby the light of your \ufb01re, and in the \ufb02ame wherewith ye kindled\nit; because of me came this upon you, ye shall lie down in pain. \n LI. 1 Hearken to me, ye that pursue that is righteous, and\nseek the Lord: look unto the solid rock which ye did hew, and\nunto the hole of the pit which ye digged. \n 2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare\nyou; for he was one, and I called him, and blessed him, and\nloved him, and multiplied him. \n 3 And thee will I now comfort, Zion, and I did comfort all her\nwaste places; <and I will make her waste places> as\nand the western regions like a garden of the Lord; joy and\nexultation shall they \ufb01nd therein, confession and the voice of\npraise. \n 4 Hearken to me, hearken, my people; and ye kings, give\near unto me ; for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment\nfor a light of the nations. \n 5 My righteousness draweth quickly near; and my salvation\nalso shall go forth, and in my arm shall the nations hope; the\nisles shall wait for me, and in my arm shall they hope. \n 6 Lift up your eyes to the heaven, and look upon the earth\nbeneath 3 for the heaven is massed as smoke, and the earth shall\nwax old like a cloke, and they that dwell on the earth shall die\nlike as those (things); but my salvation, shall be for everlasting,\nand my righteousness shall not fail. \n 7 Hearken unto me, ye that know judgment, my people who\nhave the law in your hearts; fear ye not the reproach of men,\nand be not overcome by their despising. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 For the moth shall eat them like a garment, and the worm\nshall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever,\nand my salvation from generation to generation. \n 9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake\nas in the ancient days, the generations of old. Art thou not it\nthat hewed Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon? \n 10 Art thou not it that dried up the sea, the waters of the\ngreat deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed\nto pass over? \n 11 And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to\nZion with song, and everlasting joy upon their head; they shall\nattain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing are \ufb02ed away. \n 12 I, I, (am) he that Comforteth you; who artthou, that thou\nfearest (weak) man that shall die, and the son of man that shall\nbe made as grass; \n 13 And hast forgotten the Lord thy maker, that stretched out\nthe heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth? and hast\ntrembled continually all the day before the fury of the oppressor,\nas he made ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the\noppressor ? \n 14 He that is bowed down hasteneth to be loosed, and shall\nnot die in the pit, nor shall his bread fail. \n 15 And Ipam the Lord thy God, that stirreth up the sea, and\nits waves roared; the Lord of Hosts is his name. \n 16 put my words in thy mouth, and with the shadow\nof my hand have. I covered thee, to plant the heavens, and to\nlay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art\nmy people. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 For as a cloke shall it be eaten up by time, and as wool\nshall it be eaten up by a moth; but my righteousness shall be for\never, and my salvation for generations of generations. \n 9 Awake, awake, Jerusalem, and put on the strength of thine\narm; awake as in the beginning of a day, as a generation of\neternity. Art not thou \n 10 She that maketh desolate the sea, the water, the abundance\nof the deep? that made the depths of the sea a passage way\nfor the delivered, \n 11 and them that were redeemed? For by the Lord's doing\nshall they return, and come to Zion with joy, and everlasting\nexultation; for upon their head is exultation and praise, and joy\nshall take hold of them; grief is fallen away, and pain, and\nsighings. \n 12 I am, I am he that comforteth thee; learn of- whom thou\nwast ware, and didst fear before a mortal man, and before a son\nof man; who were dried up like grass. \n 13 And thou forgottest God that made thee, that made the\nheaven, and laid the foundations of the earth; and didst fear\ncontinually all the days the face of the wrath of him that was\nafflicting thee, for (it was) as (though) he were minded to remove\nthee; and now, where is the wrath of him that did afflict thee? \n 14 For in thy being saved he shall not stand (still), nor linger. \n 15 For I am thy God, which disturbeth the sea, and maketh\nher waves to sound; the Lord of Hosts is my name. \n 16 I will put my words in thy mouth, and under my right\nhand will I shelter thee; wherewith I set up the heaven, and\nlaid the foundation of the earth; and he shall say to Zion, Thou\nart my people. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 Wake, wake thee up, arise, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk\nat the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken\nthe bowl of the cup of bewilderment, thou hast drained it out. \n 18 There is no guide for her among all the sons that she hath\nbrought forth, neither is there any, that taketh hold of her hand\nof all the sons that she bought up. \n 19 These two things are come upon thee: who will mourn\nwith thee? wasting and destruction, and the famine and the\nsword: how shall I comfort thee? \n 20 Thy sons have fainted: they lie at the head of all the\nstreets, like an antelope in a net; they that are \ufb01lled with the\nfury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. \n 21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and\nnot with wine: \n 22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God, that pleadeth\nthe cause of his people, Behold, I take out of thine hand the\ncup of bewilderment, the bowl of the cup of my fury; thou shalt\nno more drink it again: \n 23 And I will putit into the hand of thy tormentors; which\nsaid to thy soul, Bow down, and we will pass over; and thou\ndidst set thy back as the earth, and as the street, to them that\npassed over. \n LII. I Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion! Put\non thy garments of beauty, O Jerusalem, holy city: for there\nshall no more come into thee again the uncircumcised and the\nunclean. \n \n \n\n \n 17 Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that hast drunk the\ncup of wrath from the hand of the Lord; for thou didst drink,\nand didst empty out the cup of falling, the goblet of (his) \n 18 And there was none that comforted thee from among all\nthy children that thou broughtest forth; and there was none.\nthat took hold of thy hand from among all thy sons whom\nthou didst raise up. \n 19 These two things are against thee; who shall grieve with\nthee? ruin and destruction, famine and sword: who shall\ncomfort thee? \n 20 Thy sons are they that are helpless, that lie down at the\nhead of every passage way like sodden herbs; that are full\nof the wrath of the Lord, that are undone through the Lord God. \n 21 Therefore hear, thou that art humbled, and drunken, not\nwith wine: \n 22 Thus saith the Lord, the God that judgeth his people,\nBehold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of falling, the\ngoblet of (my) wrath, and thou shalt no more drink it again: \n 23 And I will put it \u2019the hands of them that did thee\nwrong, and them that humbled thee; which said to thy soul\nBow down, that we may pass by; and thou laidest thy back even\nwith the ground, without, for them that went by. \n LII. 1 Awake, awake, Zion; put on thy strength, Zion, and\nput on \u2019glory, Jerusalem, holy city; no longer shall there pass\nthrough thee again (one) uncircumcised and unclean. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Shake thyself from the dust: arise, sit, Jerusalem! the\nbands of thy neck are loosed, O Captive daughter of Zion\u2018. \u2019 \n 3 For thus saith the LORD, .Ye were sold for nought; and not\nwith silver shall ye be redeemed. \n 4 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down into\nEgypt at the \ufb01rst to sojourn there; and Asshur oppressed them\nwithout cause. \n 5 And now, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my peopl\nis taken away for nought? they that rule over him howl, saith the\nLORD ; and my name continually all the day is despised. \n 6 I\u2018herefore my people shall know my name; therefore (they\nshall know) in that day that I am he that doth speak: Here\nam L \n 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\nbringeth glad tidings, that causeth peace to be heard ; that\nbringeth glad tidings of good, that causeth salvation to be heard;\nthat saith unto Zion, Thy God doth reign \n 8 The voice of thy watchmen! they li\ufb02: up the voice, they -\nsing together; for they shall see eye to eye, at the LoitD\u2019s\nreturn to Zion. \u0387 \n 9 Break forth, sing together, y\u2019e wastes of .Jerusalem: for the\nLORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. \n 10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of. \u2019\nall the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the\nsalvation of our God. \n 11 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye. out from thence, touch not.\nwhat is unclean; goye out of the midst of her; purify your-\n- selves, ye that bear the vessels of the LORD. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Shake off the dust, and arise; sit down, O Jerusalem, put\noff the bond from thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. \n 3 For thus saith the Lord, Ye were sold for nought, and not\nwith money shall ye be ransomed. \n 4 Thus saith the Lord, My people went down aforetime\ninto Egypt to sojourn there, and by force were they led to\nthe Assyrians. \n 5 And now, why are ye here? Thus saith the Lord, Because\nmy people were seized for nought, ye marvel and wail. Thus\nsaith the Lord, Because of you my name is continually blasphemed\namong the nations. \n 6 Therefore my people shall learn my name in that day, that\nI am verily he that speaketh: I am here, \n 7 Like beauty upon the mountains, like the feet of one\nbringing glad tidings of news of peace, like one that bringeth\nglad tidings of good things; for I will make thy salvation heard,\nsaying to Zion, God shall reign over thee. \n 8 For the voice of them that watch over thee is upraised, and\nwith their voice shall they rejoice together: for eyes shall look -\nupon eyes, when the Lord hath mercy upon Zion. \n 9 Let the waste places of jerusalem break forth together in\njoy, for the Lord hath mercy upon her, and bath delivered\nJerusalem. \n 10 And the Lord will make bare his holy arm before all the\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation\nthat cometh from God. \n 11 Depart, depart ye, go forth from thence, and touch not what\nis unclean; go forth from the midst of her, separate yourselves,\nye that bear the vessels of the Lord. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 For ye shall not go out in haste, nor go in \ufb02ight: for the\nLord goeth before you, and the God of Israel is your rereward. \n 13 Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be high, and\nlifted up, and exalted exceedingly. \n 14 Like as many were appalled at thee; his sightliness was\nso marred from (that of) a man, and his form from (that of)\nthe sons of men: \u2019 \n 15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; kingsshall shut their\nmouths because of him; for that which was not recounted to\nthem shall they see, and that which they heard not shall they\ndiscern. \n LIII. 1 Who hath believed our message? and the arm of\nthe Lord, to whom was it revealed? \n 2 And he grew up before him as a sapling, and as a root\nout of a dry ground: he had no form nor majesty; and we saw\nhim, and there was no sightliness, that we should desire him. \n 3 Despised and avoided of men; a man of pains, and one\nthat knew sickness; and as one from whom faces are hid despised,\nand we esteemed him not. \n 4 Surely he bore- our sicknesses; and our pains, he supported\nthem; and we, (on our part,) did esteem him stricken, smitten\nof God, and afflicted. \n 5 And he was pierced for our rebellions, bruised for our\niniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and\nin his stripes was there healing for us. \n 6 All we like sheep did go astray; we turned every one to\nhis own way; and the lord made to fall upon him the iniquity\nof us all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 For not with confusion shall ye go forth, nor in \ufb02ight shall\nye go: for the Lord will go before in front of you, and the Lord,\nthe God of Israel, is he that gathereth you together. \n 13 Behold, my servant shall understand, and shall be exalted,\nand be glorified exceedingly. \n 14 Like as many shall be amazed at thee,\u2014so shall thy\nbe despised from among men, and thy glory from among men. \n 15 So shall many nations marvel at him, and kings shall shut\ntheir mouth; for (they) to whom it was not declared shall see\nconcerninglhim, and they who have not heard shall understand. \n LIII. 1 Lord, who did believe our report? and the arm of\nthe Lord, to whom was it revealed ? \n 2 We declared him as a child before him, as (is) a root in\na thirsty land; he hath no form nor glory. And we saw him,\nand he had no form nor comeliness, \n 3 But his form was unhonoured, and failing among all men;\na man under a stroke, and one that knew how to bear sickness;\nfor his face is turned away, he was dishonoured and not\nesteemed. \n 4 This is he that beareth our sins, and sorroweth for us;\nand we esteemed him to be in trouble, and under a stroke, and\ncalamity. \n 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, and was sick\nbecause of our sins; the discipline of our peace was upon him;\nwith his stripe we were healed. \n 6 All we like sheep-did go astray, each strayed by his own\nway; and the Lord gave him over to our sins. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 He was oppressed, and he humbled himself, and opened\nnot his mouth; as a lamb (that) is led to the slaughter, and\nas a sheep (that) is dumb before her shearers; and he opened\nnot his mouth. \n 8 From restraint and from judgment he was taken away;\nand as for his generation, who considereth, that he was cut off\nout of the land of the living? for the rebellion of my people\nwas he stricken. \n 9 And one appointed his grave with wicked men, and with\na rich man in his death; because he had done no violence, and\nthere was no deceit in his mouth. \n 10 And the LORD was pleased to bruise him; he laid sickness\non him; if his soul should make a guilt-offering, he should see\na seed, he should prolong days, and the pleasure of the Lord\nshould prosper in his hand. \n 11 Out of the travail of his. soul he shall see, he shall be\nsatisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant make\nmany righteous; for he will bear their iniquities. \n 12 Therefore will I give him part among the many, and he\nshall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out\nhis soul unto death; and he was numbered with the rebellious;\nand himself bare the sin of many, and made intercession for\nthe rebellious. \n LIV. 1 Sing, \u039f barren, that didst not bear; break forth\ninto singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail; for more\nare the children of the desolate than the children of the married\nwife, saith the Lord. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 7 And be, for that he hath been evil \u2019eated, openeth not\nhis mouth; he was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb\ndumb before the shearer, so he openeth not his mouth. \n 8 In humiliation his judgment was taken away; who\nshall describe \u2019 generation? for his life is removed from\nthe earth; from the transgressions of my people was he led to\ndeath. \n 9 And I give the wicked instead of his burial, and the\nrich instead of his death; because he committed no transgression,\nneither was guile found in his mouth. \n 10 And the Lord desireth cleanse him from his plague:\nif ye offer for sin, your soul shall see a long lived seed: and\nthe Lord desireth to take (him) away .from the trouble of\nhis soul, \n 11 To show to him alight, and to form him with understanding\nto justify a just one that serveth many aright, and\ntheir sins shall he himself bear. \n 12 Therefore he shall make many to inherit, and the spoils\nof the mighty shall he divide; because his soul was given over\nunto death; and he was reckoned among the transgressors; and\nhimself bare the sins of many, and was given over because of\ntheir sins. \n LIV. 1 Rejoice, barren one that bearest not, break forth\nand cry aloud, thou that travailest not; for many are the\nof the desolate, rather than of her that hath her husband; for\nthe Lord hath spolten it. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Widen the place of. thy tent, and let them stretch forth the\ncurtains of thy habitation; withhold not; lengthen thy cords,\nand strengthen thy stakes: \n 3 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the\nleft; \u2019thy seed shall possess nations, and make desolate.\nnations to be inhabited. \n 4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; and be not confounded,\nfor thou shalt not blush; for thou shalt forget the\nshame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of\nthy widowhood any more. \n 5 For thy husband is thy Maker; the LORD of Hosts is his\nname; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel: the God\nof the whole earth shall he be called. \n 6 For the LORD hath called thee as a wife forsaken and\ngrieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when she is rejected, saith\n\u1f96 thy God. \n 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great\n- mercies I gather thee. \n 8 In a gush of wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment;\nand with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee;\nsaith the LORD thy Redeemer. \n 9 For this is the waters of Noah unto me; as I have sworn\ni that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth;\nso have I sworn that I will not be wrbth with thee, nor re?\nbuke thee \n 10 For the mountains shall remove, and the hills totter; yet\nmy lovingkindness shall not remove from thee, nor my covenant\nof peace totter, saith he that hath mercy on thee, the Lord. \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 Widen the place of thy tent, and of thy curtains; make\nfast, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy\nstakes : \n 3 Spread it out yet to the right hand and to the left; and\nthy seed shall inherit nations, and thou shalt people cities that\nhave been desolate. \n 4 Fear not, because thou wast put to shame; and turn not\nback, because thou wast reproached; for thou shalt forget thy\nperpetual shame, and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou\nnot remember. \n 5 For thy Maker is the Lord, the Lord of Hosts is his name;\n- and he that delivereth thee is the very God of Israel, he shall\nbe called (so) in all the earth. \n 6 Not as a woman forsaken <and faint of heart>\nLord called thee, nor as a woman hated from her youth, saith\nthy God. \n 7 For a little while I forsook thee, and with great mercy will\nI have mercy on thee. \n 8 In a little wrath I turned my face away from thee, and in\neverlasting mercy have I had mercy \u2019on thee: saith the Lord\nthy deliverer. \n 9 From the water that was in the time of Noah this is mine,\nas I sware to him at that time, that I would no more be wroth\nwith the earth because of thee, nor for a threatening of thee\nremove the mountains: \n 10 Nor shall thy hills be shaken from their place: so neither\nshall the mercy that cometh from me upon thee fail, nor the\ncovenant of thy peace be removed ; for he said, TheLord is\ngracious to thee. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 \u039f thou afficted, tossed with tempest, not comforted ;\nbehold I lay thy stones in antimony, and thy foundations with\nsapphires. \n 12 And I will make thy battlements rubies, and thy gates. to\nbe \ufb01ery stones, and all thy border stones of pleasure. \n 13 And all thy sons shall be disciples of the LORD, andgreat\nshallbe the peace of thy sons. \n 14 In righteousness shalt thou be established; be thou far\nfrom oppression, for thou shalt not fear, and from destruction,\nfor it shall not come near thee. \n 15 Behold, they surely gather together; it is not of me; who\ngathereth against thee? he shall fall because of thee. \n 16 Behold, I have created the craftsman, that bloweth on the\n\ufb01re of coals, and that bringeth forth a weapon for its work; and\n\u0399 have created the waster to destroy. \n 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and\nevery tongue (that) shall rise up against thee in judgment thou\nshalt convict. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD,\nand their righteousness from me, saith the Lord. \n LV. I Ah, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,\nand he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and eat: and come, buy\nwine and milk, for no silver and for no price. \n 2 Wherefore do ye weigh silver for no bread, and your earnings\nfor that which is not to satisfy? hearken, (only) hearken\nunto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight\nitself in fatness. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 Humbled and unstable, thou wast not comforted; behold,\nI prepare for thee carbuncle for thy stone, and sapphire for\nthy foundations. \n 12 And I will make thy battlements of jasper, and thy gates\nof crystal stones, and thy circuit of chosen stones. \n 13 And (I will make) all thy sons instructed of the Lord, and\nthy children (to be) in great peace. \n 14 (And in righteousness shalt thou be builded; refrain from\nwrong, and thou shalt not be afraid, and trembling shall not\ncome nigh thee \n 15 Behold, strangers shall approach unto thee through me,\nand they shall dwell by thee, and \ufb02ee for refuge to thee. \n 16 Behold, I create thee, not as doth a smith that bloweth\nthe coals, and bringeth forth an instrument for-a work: but I have I\ncreated thee not for destruction, to waste thee. \n 17 Every instrument is corruptible, but against thee I will not\napprove it; and every voice that shall stand up against thee for\njudgment, all them shalt thou vanquish, and they that are subject\n\u2019to thee shall be therein. There is an inheritance for them that\nattend on the Lord, and ye shall be righteous in my sight, saith\nthe Lord. \n LV. I Ye that thirst, come to (the) water, and all ye that\nhave no money, come and buy, and drink, without money and\nprice, of the wine, and the fat. \n 2 Wherefore do ye value (them) for money, and your labour,\nnot for satisfying? and ye shall eat good things, and your soul\nshall delight itself in good things. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul\nshall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you;\nthe faithful lovingkindnesses of David. \n 4 Behold, I have given him for a witness of peoples, a chief\nand commander of peoples. \n 5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and\na nationthat knoweth not thee shall run unto thee; for the sake\nof the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he\nhath glori\ufb01ed thee. \n 6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him\nwhile he is near. \n 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his\nthoughts; and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have\nmercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly\npardon. \n 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your\nways my ways, saith the LORD. \n 9 \u201cFor (as) the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my\nways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your\nthoughts. \n 10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven,\nand returneth not thither, unless it have watered the earth, and\nmade it bringtforth and sprout, and given seed to the sower,\nand bread to the eater: \n 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth;\nit shall not return unto me void, unless it have accomplished that\nwhich I please, and made to prosper thatfor which I sent it. \n 12 For ye shall go forth with joy, and be led in peace; the\nmountains and the hills shall break forth before you [into singing,\nand all the trees of the \ufb01eld shall clap the hand. \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 Attend with your ears, and follow ye my paths; hearken\nto me, and your soul shall live amid good things; and I will\nmake with you an everlasting covenant, the holy things of David\nthat are sure. \n 4 Behold, I have given him for a testimony among nations,\n- a ruler and commander over nations. \n 5 Nations which knew not thee shall call upon thee; and\npeoples which understand not thee shall \ufb02ee unto thee, for thy\n\u2019s sake, the Holy One of Israel; for he glorifieth thee. \n 6 Seek ye God, and as ye \ufb01nd him, call upon him ; and when\nsoever he draweth near unto thee, \n 7 Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the man that transgresseth\nhis counsels; and let him return unto the Lord, and\nhe will have mercy upon him; for far away will he dismiss\nyour sins. \n 8 For my counsels are not as your counsels, nor are my ways\nas your ways, saith the Lord. \n 9 But, as the heaven is far from the earth, so is my way far\n- from your ways, and your thoughts from my thought. \n 10 For as rain cometh down, or snow from heaven, and will\nnot return, until it have watered the earth, and she, bring forth\nand blossom, and shall give seed to the sower, and bread for\nfood: \n 11 So shall be my word, whatsoever goeth forth from my\nmouth; it shall not return until all that I willed be fulfilled\nand I prosper thy ways and my commandments. \n 12 For ye shall go forth in joy, and in delight shall ye be\ntaught; for the mountains and the hills shall leap forth, welcoming\n\u2019 you in delight, and all the trees of the \ufb01eld shall clash their\nbranches, \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the \ufb01r tree, and\ninstead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; and it shall\nbe to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall\nnot be cut off. \n LVI. 1 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and. do\nrighteousness 3 for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness\nto be revealed. \n 2 Happy is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that\nboldeth fast by it; that keepeth the sabbath, not to profane it,\nand keepeth his hand, not to do any evil. \n 3 And let not the alien, that hath joined himself to the LORD,\nspeak, saying, The LORD will surely separate me from his people;\nand let not the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. \n 4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my\nsabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast\nby my covenant: \n 5 I Will even give unto them in my house and within my walls\na memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will\ngive him an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. \n 6 And the aliens, that have joined themselves to the LORD,\nto minister unto him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be\nhis servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath, not to profane it,\nand boldeth fast by my covenant : \n 7 Them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them\njoyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their\nsacrifices (shall be) acceptable upon mine altar; for mine house\n\u2019 shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples. \n 8 Saith the Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel,\nYet I gather (more) unto him, to his gathered ones. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 And instead of the broom shall come up the cypress, and\ninstead of the fleabane shall come up a myrtle-tree; and the\nLord shall be for a name and for an everlasting sign, and shall\nnot fail. \n LVI. Thus saith the Lord, Guard ye judgment, do righteousness;\nfor my salvation is come near to appear, and my mercy\nto be revealed. \n 2 Happy is \u2019the man that doeth this, and the mortal that\nholdeth fast thereto, and guardeth the sabbaths, not to pollute\nthem, and watcheth his hands, to do no wrong. \n 3 Let not the stranger, that cleaveth to the Lord, say, Then\nwill the Lord separate me from his people; and let not the\neunuch say, I am a dry tree. \n 4 Thus saith the Loid to all the eunuchs that keep my\nsabbaths, and choose out what I desire, and hold fast to my\ncovenant: \n 5 I will give to them in my house and within my wall\n\u2019 a notable place; (it is) better than sons and daughters; an everlasting\nname will I give to them, and it shall not fail; \n 6 And to all the strangers that cleave to the Lord, to serve\nhim, and to love the name of the, Lord, that they may be to\nhim for bondmen and for bondwomen; and \u2019for) all them\nthat. keep my sabbaths, not to pollute them, and hold fast to\nmy covenant, \n 7 \u0399 will bring them in to my holy mountain, and make them\njoyful in the house of my prayer; their whole burnt offerings\nand their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar. For mine\nhouse shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations, \n 8 Saith the Lord that gathereth together the dispersed of Israel,\nfor I will gather unto him a gathering. \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 All ye beasts of the \ufb01eld, come to devour; all beasts of\nthe forest. \n 10 His watchmen are blind, they know not, all of them; they\nare all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down,\nloving to slumber. \n 11 And the dogs are strong of soul, they know not satiety;\nand they, the shepherds, know not how to discern; they are all\nturned to their own. way, every one to his gain, from the\nfurthest end of it. \n 12 Come ye, I will fetch wine, and we will \ufb01ll ourselves with\nstrong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, very exceeding\ngreat. \n LVII. 1 The. righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to\nheart; and men of lovingkindness are taken away, none considering\nthat the righteous is taken away from the face of the\nevil. \n 2 He entereth into peace; they rest on their beds, whoso\nwalketh straight forward. \n 3 And ye, draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, seed of\nan adulterer and a whore. \n 4 At whom do ye make sport? at whom widen ye the mouth,\nand lengthen the tongue? Are ye not children of rebellion,\na seed of falsehood? \n 5 Inflaming yourselves among the terebinths; under every\ngreen tree; slaying the children in the torrent-valleys under the\nclefts of the rocks. \n 6 Among the smooth (stones) of the torrent-valley is thy\nportion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured\nout a drink-offering, thou hast offered a meat-offering. Shall\nI relent for these things? \n 7 Upon a mountain exalted and lifted up hast thou set thy\nbed; even there hast thou gone up to offer sacrifice. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 All ye wild beasts of the \ufb01eld, come hither and eat, all ye\nwild beasts of the forest. \n 10 See ye, that all are utterly blinded, they have not learnt\n\u2019 to have understanding; dumb dogs all, they will not be able to\nbark; dreaming on their couch, prone to slumber. \n 11 And the dogs are insatiate of heart, and \u2019know not satisfy-\ning; and they are wicked, knowing no wisdom; all follow their\nown ways, each after the same manner. \n 12 * * * * * * * \n LVII. I See ye, how the righteous hath perished, and no\nman accepts it in his heart, and righteous men are taken away,\nand no man considereth; for from the face of wrong hath the\nrighteous been taken away, \n 2. His burial shall be in peace, he is removed out of the\nmidst; \n 3 But draw ye near hither, sons that are transgressors, ye\nseed of adulterers and a whore. \n 4 Wherein do ye take delight? and against whom open ye\nyour mouth? and against whom do ye drop out your tongue?\nare ye not children of perdition, a transgressing seed? \n 5 Ye, that call upon your idols under leafy trees, that slay\nyour children in the valleys amid \u2019rocksl \n 6 That is your portion, this is your lot: and for those thou\ndidst pour out drink-offerings, and to those thou didst bring\nsacrifices: shall I not then be wroth for this? \n 7 Upon a mountain high and lofty, there was thy couch, and\nthere broughtest thou up sacrifices \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 And behind the door and the post hast thou set thy\nmemorial; for away from me hast thou uncovered, and gone up,\nhast enlarged thy bed, and gotten thee a covenant from them;\nthou hast loved their bed, hast looked on a hand. \n 9 And thou hast travelled to the king with oil, and hast\nmultiplied thy perfumes, and hast sent thine envoys far off, and\nhast brought (thyself )1 down, even to hell. \n 10 Thou hast wearied thyself with the abundance of thy\ntravel; thou saidst not, It is hopeless; thou hast found revival\nof thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint. \n 11 And of whom hast thou been afraid, and feared, that thou\nshouldest lie, and hast not remembered me, hast not laid it to\nthine heart? Have I not held my peace, and that from of old,\nand thou fearest not me? \n 12 I will declare thy righteousness; and thy works, and they\nshall not profit thee. \n 13 When thou criest, let thy gatherings deliver thee; and\na wind shall lift them all up, a breath shall take them away;\nand he that trusteth in me shall inherit the land, and shall.\npossess my holy mountain: \n 14 And (one) saith, Cast up, cast up, clear a. way; take up\nthe stumbling block out of the way of my people. \n 15 For thus saith he. that is high and lifted up, that dwelleth\nfor ever, and. holy 15 ms name ; I dwell in the high andholy\nplace, and with him that is crushed and humble of spirit, to\nrevive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the\ncrushed ones. \n 16 For I will not contend forever, and not always I be,\nwroth; for the spirit would fail from before me, and the souls\nwhich I have made. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 And behind the posts of thy door didst thou set thy\nmemorials; thou thoughtest, that if thou shouldst revolt from\nme, thou wouldst gain advantage; thou lovedst them that lay\nwith thee, \n 9 And didst multiply thine adultery with them, and madest\nmany them that were far off from thee, and didst send envoys\n- beyond thy borders, and tumedst away, and wert abased even\nto hell. \n 10 By thy much journeyings \u2019thou wert wearied, and saidst\nnot, I will cease; being strong in that thou didst thus; therefore\nthou besoughtest me not. \n 11 Of whom wast thou ware, and fearedst; and didst deceive\nme, and rememberedst me not, neither tookest me into thy\nthought? and I saw thee, and looked aside, and thou fearedst\nnot me. \n 12 And I declare. my righteousness, and thy evil deeds; which\nshall not profit thee. \n 13 When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in thy affliction\nfor a wind shall take all these, and a tempest shall hear them\naway. But they that hold fast to me shall possess the earth,\n\u1f22 and shall inherit my holy mountain, \n 14 And they shall say, Cleanse the paths before his face; remove\nstumbling blocks from the way of my people. \n 15 Thus saith the Lord, the highest among the high, that\ninhabiteth eternity, Holy among the holy is his name, the Lord,\nthe highest, resting among the holy, and giving patience to the\nfaint hearted, and giving life to them whose hearts are crushed: \n 16 And not for ever will I punish you, nor \u2019I alway be\nangry with you 3 for a spirit shall go forth from me, and I have\nmade every breath. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 For the iniquity of his gain was I wroth, and smote him\nI hid myself and was \u2019wroth, and he wenton perversely in the\nway of his heart. \n 18 I have seen his ways, and I will heal him; and I will lead\nhim, and requite with comfort him and his mourners; \n 19 Creating fruit of the lips, Peace, peace, to the far off and\nthe near, saith the LORD, and I will heal him. \n 20 And the wicked are like the stirred up sea; for it cannot.\nrest, and its waters stir up mire and \n 21 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. \n LVIII. I Cry with the throat, withhold not, raise thy voice\nlike a trumpet, and tell my people their rebellion, and the house\nof Jacob their sins. \u2019 \n 2 And (yet) they inquire of me day by day, and take pleasure\nin the knowledge of my, ways; as a nation that hath done\nrighteousness, and not forsaken the judgment of its God; they\nask of me the judgments of righteousness; they take pleasure\nin drawing near to God. \n 3 Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not? afflited our\nsoul, and thou knowest not? Behold, in the day of your fast\nye \ufb01nd pleasure, and exact all your tasks. \n 4 Behold, ye fast for contention and quarrel, and to smite\nwith the \ufb01st of wickedness; ye shall not fast as to-day, to make\nyour voice to be heard on high. \n 5 Shall such be the fast I will choose? a day of man's afflicting\nhis soul? is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and\nspread out sackcloth and ashes (as a bed)? Wilt thou call this\na fast, and an acceptable day to the-LORD? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 17 For sin I troubled him a little while, and I smote him,\nand turned my face from him; and he was troubled, and went\ngloomily in his ways. \n 18 I have seen his ways, and I healed him, and comforted\nhim, and gave him true comfort, \n 19 Peace upon peace to them that are far off, and them that\nare near; and the Lord said, I will heal them: \n 20 But so the unrighteous shall be tossed as waves, and shall\nnot be able to rest. \n 21 There is no rejoicing, saith the Lord God, for the wicked. \n LVIII. I Cry out with strength, and spare not, lift up thy\nvoice as a trumpet, and declare to thy people their sins, and to\nthe house of Jacob their transgressions. \n 2 They will seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways:\nas a people that hath practised the righteousness of God, and\nhath not forsaken the judgment of its God; they ask of me now\nrighteous judgment, and desire to draw near to God, \n 3 Saying, Why is it that we have fasted, and thou sawest not?\nhumbled our souls, and thou perceivedst not? for in the days\nof your fast ye \ufb01nd your desires, and vex all those subject\nunto you. \n 4 Ye fast for quarrels and strife, and smite a humble man\nwith \ufb01sts; wherefore fast ye before me as to-day, for your voice\nto be heard in clamour? \n 5 This is not the fast that I choose, and a day for a man to\nhumble his soul; not even if thou bend thy neck like a ring,\nand spread sackcloth and ashes under thee, not even so shall\nye call it an acceptable fast. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 Is not this the fast that I will choose? to loose the bands\nof wickedness, to undo the thongs of the yoke, and to let the\ncrushed go free, and that ye should break every yoke? \n 7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou\nbring afflicted outcasts home? when thou seest the naked, that\nthou cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own \ufb02esh? \n 8 Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn, and thy healing\nshall spring up speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before\nthee, the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward. \n 9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou\nshalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou remove from\nthe midst of thee the yoke, the pointing of the \ufb01nger, and speaking\niniquity: \n 10 And furnish thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted\nsoul ; then shall thy light arise in the darkness, and thy gloom\nbe as the noonday: \n 11 And the LORD shall lead thee perpetually, and satisfy thy\nsoul in dry places, and make strong thy bones: and thou shalt\nbe like a watered garden, ahd like a spring of water whose\nwaters fail not. \n 12 And they that are of thee shall build up ruins of old\ntime: thou shalt raise up the foundations of generation upon\ngeneration; and thou shalt be called Repairer of the breach,\nRestorer of paths to dwell in. \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 Not such a fast as this do I choose, saith the Lord; but\nloose every bond of iniquity, unloose the knots of oppressive\ncompacts, send forth the broken in forgiveness and tear asunder\nevery unjust writing: \n 7 Break thy bread for one that is hungry, and bring the\nhomeless poor into thine house; if thou see one naked, clothe\nhim, and of the kinsmen of thy seed thou shalt not despise\nany. \n 8 Then shall thy light break forth early in the morning, and\nthy healing shall arise speedily; and thy righteousness shall go\nbefore thee, and the glory of God shall wrap thee round. \n 9 Then shalt thou cry, and God shall hearken to thee; while\nthou art yet speaking, he shall say, Behold, here I am. If thou\ntake away from thee bonds, and stretching forth of hands, and\nthe word of murmuring, \n 10 And give to a hungry man thy bread from thy soul, and\nsatisfy the soul that hath been humbled, then shall thy light arise\nin the darkness, and thy darkness (shall be) as noonday, \n 11 And thy God shall be <with thee> continually; and thou\nshalt be satisfied according as thy soul desireth, and thy bones\nshall be enriched, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as\na spring whose water faileth not; and thy bones shall grow up\nas grass, and shall be enriched, and they shall inherit for generations\nof generations. \n 12 And thy desolate places of old shall be rebuilt, and thy\nfoundations shall be everlasting, for generations of generations;\nand thou shalt be called, A builder of fences, and thou shalt\nmake thy paths in the midst to rest. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, as to doing\nthy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight,\nthe holy (day) of the LORD honourable; and honour it, not\ndoing thine own ways, not \ufb01nding thine own pleasure, nor\nspeaking words: \n 14 Then shalt thou have thy delight in the LORD; and I will\ncause thee to ride upon the heights of the earth, and to eat\nthe heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the LORD\nhath spoken it. \n LIX. I Behold, the \u2019S hand is not shortened, that it\ncannot save ; neither his ear grown heavy, that it cannot hear: \n 2 But your iniquities have been separating between you and\nyour God, and your sins have hidden the Face from you, that\nhe hear not. \n 3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your \ufb01ngers\nwith iniquity; your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue will\nmutter wickedness. \n 4 There is none that sueth in righteousness, and none that\npleadeth in truth; they trust in emptiness, and speak vanity;\nthey conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. \n 5 They hatch \u2019s eggs, and weave spider's webs; he that\neateth of their eggs shall die, and that which is crushed, it\nhatcheth out into an adder. \n 6 Their webs shall not serve for a garment, neither shall they\ncover themselves with their works; their works are works of\niniquity, and the practice of violence is in their hands. \n 7 Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent\nblood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and destruction\nare in their highways. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbaths, not to do\nthine own desires on the holy day, and thou shalt call the\nsabbaths full of pleasure, holy to thy God, thou shalt not lift\nthy foot for work, nor speak a word in anger out of thy mouth, \n 14 Then thou shalt have thy trust in the Lord, and he shall\nset thee up upon the good things of the earth, and shall feed\nthee upon the inheritance of Jacob thy father; for the mouth\nof the Lord hath spoken this. \n LIX. 1 Is not the Lord's hand mighty to save? or hath he\nmade his ear heavy, that it hear not? \n 2 But your sins separate between you <and your God,;>\nbecause of your sins hath he turned his face away from you,\nnot to have mercy upon you. \n 3 For your hands are defiled-with blood, and your \ufb01ngers in\nsins; and your lips have spoken transgression, and your tongue\ndoth meditate wrong-doing. \n 4 No man speaketh righteousness, nor is there any true judgment;\nthey trust in vanities and speak empty words; for they\nhave conceived trouble, and bring forth transgression. \n 5 They brake the eggs of asps, and weave the web of a spider;\nand he that trieth to eat of their eggs, when he breaketh it he\n\ufb01ndeth wind, and in it is a basilisk. \n 6 Their web shall not be for a garment; nor shall they be\nclothed with their works; for their works are works of\ntransgression. \n 7 And their feet run after wickedness, swift to shed blood,\nand their reasonings (are) the reasonings of fools; destruction\nand unhappiness is in their ways, \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 The way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment\nin their tracks; they have made them their paths crooked; whosoever\ngoeth therein knoweth not peace. \n 9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth righteousness\novertake us; we wait for light, and behold darkness; for\nbrightness,\u2014we walk in \n 10 We grope along the wall like blind men, and we grope as\nmen without eyes; we have stumbled at noonday as in the dusk;\namong the vigorous as the dead. \n 11 We all groan like bears, and moan piteously like doves;\nwe wait for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, it is\nfar off from us. \n 12 For our rebellions are multiplied before thee, and our sins\ntestify against us; for our rebellions are with us, and our\niniquities, we know them: \n 13 Rebelling and denying the LORD, and drawing back from\nfollowing our God: speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving\nand uttering from the heart words of falsehood. \n 14 And judgment is driven backward, and righteousness\nstandeth afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the broad place,\nand uprightness cannot enter. \n 15 And truth is (found) missing, and he that removeth from\nevil maketh himself a prey; and the LORD saw it, and it was\nevil in his eyes that there was no judgment. \n 16 And he saw that there was no man, and was amazed that\nthere was none that interposed; therefore his own arm wrought\nsalvation for him, and his righteousness, it upheld him. \n 17 And he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a\nhelmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments\nof vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in jealousy as\na cloke. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 8 And a way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment\nin their ways; for the paths which they travel are perverted, and\nthey know not peace. \n 9 Therefore did their judgment depart from them, and righte-\nousness shall not take hold of them ; when (they) waited for light,\ndarkness came upon them; they waited for a shining, and walked\nin midnight gloom. \n 10 They shall grope like blind men for a wall, and as though\nthey had no eyes shall they grope; and they shall fall at noonday\nas though at midnight, they shall groan as dying men: \n 11 As a bear and as a dove together shall they go: we\nwaited for judgment, and there is none; salvation is far removed\nfrom us. \n 12 For manifold is our transgression before thee, and our\nsins stand forth against us; for our transgressions are in us, and\nour wrong doings we have learnt. \n 13 We were profane, and lied, and departed away from behind\nour God; we talked unrighteously and were disobedient, we\nconceived and rehearsed unrighteous words from our heart, \n 14 And removed (our) judgment behind us, and righteousness\nstandeth far off from us; for truth is consumed in their streets,\nand they could not go through by straight ways. \n 15 And truth is removed, and they changed their thought\nfrom understanding; and the Lord saw it, and it pleased him\nnot, that there was no judgment. \n 16 And he saw, and there was no man, and he perceived,\nand there was none that would take hold; and he defended them\nwith his arm, and with his mercy he supported them. \n 17 And he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and put on\nan helmet of salvation upon his head, and clothed himself in\na cloke of vengeance, and his clothing \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 According to their deeds, accordingly will he requite, fury\nto his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the isles he\nwill requite recompense. \n 19 And they shall fear the name of the LORD from the setting,\nand his glory from the rising of the sun; for he shall come as\na pent-up stream, which the breath of the LORD driveth. \n 20 And a redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn\nfrom rebellion in Jacob, saith the LORD. \n 21 And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the\nLORD; my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have\nput in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out\nof the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's\nseed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. \n LX. 1 Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of\nthe LORD hath risen upon thee. \n 2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and deep\ngloom the peoples; but the LORD shall rise upon thee, and his\nglory shall appear upon thee. \n 3 And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness\nof thy rising. \n 4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; they are all\ngathered, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and\nthy daughters shall be carried on the side. \n 5 Then thou shalt see, and be bright, and thy heart shall\nthrob, and be enlarged; for the abundance of the sea shall turn\nunto thee, the wealth of nations shall come to thee. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 18 As ready to requite, a requital of shame unto his\nadversaries \n 19 And they from the setting (of the sun) shall fear the name\nof the Lord, and they from the rising of the sun his glorious\nname; for the anger of the Lord shall come like a rushing\nriver, it shall come with wrath. \n 20 And the deliverer shall come for Zion's sake, and shall turn\naway ungodliness from Jacob. \n 21 And this is the covenant to them from me, saith the Lord;\nmy spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put\nin thy mouth, shall not fail out of thy mouth, and out of the\nmouth of thy seed: the Lord hath spoken it, henceforth and\nfor ever. \n LX. 1 Shine, shine, Jerusalem; for thy light is come, and\nthe glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. \n 2 Behold, darkness and gloom covereth the earth upon (the)\nnations; upon thee shall the Lord appear, and his glory shall\nbe seen upon thee: \n 3 And kings shall walk by thy light, and nations by thy\nbrightness. \n 4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see thy children\ni gathered together; behold, all thy sons are come from far, and\nthy daughters shall be borne upon the shoulders. \n 5 Then thou shalt see, and fear, and be amazed in heart,\nbecause there shall come over unto thee the wealth of the sea,\nand of nations and peoples. And there shall come unto thee \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 A stream of camels shall cover thee, young camels of\nMidian and Ephah; all of them shall come from Sheba, they\nshall bear gold and incense, and they shall tell tidings of the\npraises of the LORD. \n 7 All the \ufb02ocks of Kedar shall gather together unto thee, the\nrams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; they shall go up\nwith acceptance on mine altar, and I will beautify the house of\nmy beauty. \n 8 Who are these that \ufb02y as a cloud, and as doves to their\nlattices? \n 9 Surely the isles are waiting for me, and the ships of Tarshish\n\ufb01rst, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with\nthem, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy\nOne of Israel; for he hath beautified thee. \n 10 And aliens shall build thy walls, and their kings shall\nminister unto thee; for in my wrath I smote thee, and in my\nfavour have I had mercy upon thee. \n 11 And thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not\nbe shut, day and night; to bring unto thee the wealth of nations,\nand their kings led along; \n 12 For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee\nshall perish; and the nations shall be utterly wasted. \n 13 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the \ufb01r tree,\nthe plane tree and the larch together, to beautify the place\nof my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet\nhonourable. \n 14 And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall go unto\nthee, bowing down; and all they that scorned thee shall bow\nthemselves to the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee the\nCity of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 6 Herds of camels, and the camels of Midian and Ephah\nshall cover thee; all (they) from Sheba shall come, bringing gold,\nand they shall bring frankincense and precious stone, and shall\nbring glad tidings of the salvation of the Lord. \n 7 And all the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered together, and\nthe rams of Nebaioth shall come for thee, and acceptable (offerings)\nshall be brought unto mine altar, and my house of prayer\nshall be glorifed \n 8 Who are these that \ufb02y like clouds, and like doves with\ntheir nestlings? \n 9 For me did the isles wait, and the ships of Tarshish \ufb01rst\nof all, to bring thy children from far, and their silver and their\ngold with them, because of the name of the Lord, which is holy,\nand because the Holy One of Israel is glorious. \n 10 And strangers shall build thy walls, and their kings shall\nstand beside thee: for because of my wrath I smote thee, and\nbecause of my mercy I loved thee. \n 11 And thy gates shall be opened continually, by day and by\nnight they shall not be shut, to bring unto thee the power of\nnations, and kings led along. \n 12 For the nations and their kings, whosoever will not serve\nthee shall die, and the nations shall be utterly desolated. \n 13 And the glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, with\nthe cypress and pine and cedar together, to glorify my holy\nplace. \n 14 And there shall come unto thee in fear the sons of them\nthat humbled thee and provoked thee; and thou shalt be called,\nCity of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 Instead of thy being forsaken and hated, and none passing\nthrough thee; I will set thee for an everlasting pride, a gladness\nof generation upon generation. \n 16 And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and shalt suck\nthe breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy\nSaviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. \n 17 Instead of brass I will bring gold, and instead of iron\nI will bring silver, and instead of wood brass, and instead of\nstones iron; and I will make thy government peace, and thine\noverseers righteousness. \n 18 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor\ndestruction in thy borders; and thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,\nand thy gates Praise. \n 19 The sun shall no more be thy light by day; and as for\nshining, the moon shall not give light to thee; and the LORD\nshall be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy beauty. \n 20 Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon\nwithdraw itself; for the LORD shall be to thee an everlasting\nlight, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled \n 21 And thy people shall be all of them righteous; they shall\npossess the land for ever; the shoot of my planting, the work\nof my hands, that I may beautify myself. \n 22 The smallest shall become a thousand, and the least a strong\nnation; I the LORD will hasten it in its time. \n LXI. I The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because\nthe LORD hath anointed me to bring glad tidings unto the\nafflicted; hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim\nliberty to captives, and opening of eyes to the bound: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 Because thou hast been forsaken, and hated, and there was\nnone that came to help; and I will set thee for an everlasting\ntriumph, a joy for generations of generations. \n 16 And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and shalt eat the\nwealth of kings; and shalt learn that I the Lord am thy Saviour,\nand the God of Israel that delivereth thee. \n 17 And instead of brass I will bring for thee gold, and instead\nof iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of wood I will bring\nthee brass, and instead of stones iron; and I will set thy rulers\nin peace, and thine overseers in righteousness. \n 18 And no longer shall wrong doing be heard in thy land, nor\ndestruction, nor unhappiness in thy borders; but thy walls shall\nbe called Salvation, and thy gates carved work. \n 19 And the sun shall not be thy light by day, nor shall the\nrising of the moon enlighten thy night; but the Lord shall be\nto thee an everlasting light, and God thy glory. \n 20. For thy sun shall not go down, and the moon shall not\nfail thee; for the Lord shall be to thee an everlasting light, and\nthe days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled \n 21 And thy people (shall be) all of it righteous, and they shall\npossess the earth for ever; guarding the plant, the work of his\nhands, for glory. \n 22 The smallest shall be for thousands, and the least one a\ngreat nation: I the Lord will gather them together in due season. \n LXI. 1 The spirit of the Lord is upon me; wherefore he\nhath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he hath\nsent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to\ncaptives, and recovery of sight to the blind: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 To proclaim a year of acceptance for the LORD, and a day\nof vengeance for our God; to comfort all mourners \n 3 To appoint for the mourners of Zion, to give unto them.\na garland instead of ashes, the Oil of gladness instead Of mourning,\na garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; and they shall\nbe called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that\nhe may beautify himself. \n 4 And they shall build up ruins of old time; they shall raise\nup desolations of the \ufb01rst days; and they shall restore ruined\ncities, desolations of generation upon generation. \n 5 And strangers shall stand and feed your \ufb02ocks, and aliens\nshall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. \n 6 And ye shall be called the Priests of the LORD; men shall\nsay of you, The Ministers of our God; ye shall eat the wealth\nof nations, and in their glory shall ye boast. \n 7 Instead of your shame, (ye shall have) twofold; and as for\nconfusion, they shall sing of their portion; therefore in their\nland they shall possess twofold; everlasting joy shall be unto them \n 8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery with injustice;\nand I will give them their earnings with truth, and I will\nmake an everlasting covenant with them. \n 9 And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their\noffspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge\nthem, that they are a seed which the LORD hath blessed. \n 10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall exult in\nmy God; for he hath put on me garments of salvation, he hath\nwrapped me in a cloke of righteousness, as a bridegroom putteth\non priestly garland, and as a bride doth don her jewels. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 2 To call it an acceptable year of the Lord, and a day of\nrequital; to comfort all them that mourn; \n 3 That there be given to the mourners of Zion glory instead\nof ashes, the anointing of joy to the mourners, a robe of glory\ninstead of a spirit of despair; and they shall be called generations\nof righteousness, a plant of the Lord for glory. \n 4 And they shall build everlasting desolations, they shall set\nup what were before utterly desolate, and they shall renew desolate\ncities, that had been desolate for generations. \n 5 And strangers shall come, feeding thy sheep, and aliens for\nplowmen and vinedressers. \n 6 But ye shall be called priests of the Lord, and ministers of\nGod; ye shall eat up the might of nations, and in their wealth\nshall ye be marvelled at. \n 7 So shall they inherit the earth a second time, and everlasting\njoy (shall be) upon their head. \n 8 For I am the Lord, that love righteousness, and hate\nrobberies (proceeding) from injustice: and I will give to the\nrighteous their toil, and I will make an everlasting covenant\nwith them. \n 9 And their seed shall become known among the nations, and\ntheir offspring; every one that seeth them shall observe them,\nthat these are a seed blessed by God. \n 10 And with joy shall they rejoice unto the Lord. Let my\nsoul triumph because of the Lord; for he hath clothed me with\na cloke of salvation and a robe of joy, he hath put a garland\non (my head) as on a bridegroom, and hath adorned me with\nornaments as a bride. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 For as the earth which putteth forth her sprout, and as\na garden which causeth its plants to sprout, so the Lord GOD\nwill cause righteousness and praise to sprout forth before all\nthe nations. \n LXII. I For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and\nfor Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go\nforth as a shining, and her salvation as a torch that burneth. \n 2 And nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy\nglory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth\nof the LORD shall pronounce. \n 3 And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the\nLORD, and a diadem of kingship in the open hand of thy God. \n 4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy\nland be any more termed Desolation; for thou shalt be called\nMy delight in her, and thy land Married: for the LORD delighteth\nin thee, and thy land shall be married. \n 5 For (as) a young man marrieth a virgin, thy sons shall marry\nthee; and with the rejoicing of a bridegroom over a bride, thy\nGod shall rejoice over thee. \n 6 \u0399 have set watchmen upon thy walls, Jerusalem; all the\nday and all the night continually they shall not hold their peace.\nYe remembrancers of the LORD, no rest for you, \n 7 And give no rest to him, until he establish, and until he set\nJerusalem (as) a praise in the earth. \n 8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm\nof his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn (as) food to\nthine enemies; and aliens shall not drink thy new wine, at which\nthou hast laboured \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 11 And like earth making her blossom to grow, and like\na garden its seeds; so will the Lord make righteousness and\ntriumph to rise up before all the nations. \n LXII. I Because of Zion I will not be silent, and because\nof Jerusalem I will not cease, until my righteousness go forth as\nlight, and my salvation shall burn as a torch. \n 2 And nations shall see thy righteousness, and kings thy\nglory; and he shall call thee by thy new name, which the Lord\nshall name. \n 3 And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the\nLord, and a diadem of royalty in the hand of thy God. \n 4 And thou shalt no longer be called Forsaken, and thy land\nshall not be any more called Desolate; for thy name shall be\ncalled My delight, and thy land, Dwelling. \n 5 And as a young man joineth house with a virgin, so shall\nthy sons found houses with thee; and it shall be, as a bridegroom\nshall rejoice over a bride, so shall the Lord rejoice\nover thee. \n 6 And upon thy walls, Jerusalem, have I set watchmen, all\nthe day and all the night, who shall not be silent for ever,\nmaking mention of the Lord. \n 7 For ye have none (other) like; if he. establish, and make\nJerusalem an exultation upon the earth. \n 8 The Lord hath sworn by his glory and by the might of\nI his arm, I will not any more give thy corn and thy meats to\nthine enemies; and no longer shall stranger children drink thy\nwine, for which thou didst labour. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 For they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the\nLORD; and they that have stored it shall drink it in my holy\ncourts. \n 10 Pass through, pass through at the gates; clear ye the\npeople's way; cast up, cast up the highway; clear it of stones;\nlift up a banner over the peoples. \n 11 Behold, the LORD hath caused it to be heard unto the end\nof the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation\ncometh; behold, his hire is with him, and his recompence\nbefore him. \n 12 And they shall call them The holy people, the redeemed\nof the LORD; and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not\nforsaken. \n LXIII. 1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with bright\nred garments from Bozrah? this, that is glorious in his raiment,\nswaying in the mightiness of his strength? I, that speak in\nrighteousness, mighty to save. \n 2 Wherefore is there red upon thy raiment, and thy garments\nlike one that treadeth in a winepress? \n 3 \u0399 have trodden the wine trough alone, and of the peoples\nthere was not a man with me; and I trode them in mine anger,\nand trampled them in my fury; and their life blood was sprinkled\non my garments, and I have stained all my raiment. \n 4 For a day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my\nredeemed ones is come. \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 But they that gather them together shall eat them, and\npraise the Lord; and they that gather them together shall drink\nthem in thy holy courts. \n 10 Go ye through my gates, and make a way for my people;\nand cast away the stones out of the way, lift up a signal to the\nnations \n 11 For behold, the Lord maketh it to be heard unto the end\nof the earth; Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy\nSaviour cometh to thee, having his own reward, and (his) work\nbefore his face. \n 12 And he shall call it an holy people, ransomed by the Lord\nwhile thou shalt be called, A city sought after, and, Not forsaken. \n LXIII. 1 Who is this that approacheth from Edom, a red-\nness of garments from Bozrah? so beauteous in his apparel,\nin violence with might? I discourse righteousness, and judgment\nof salvation \n 2 Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as from\na trodden winepress? \n 3 (I am) full with the trodden (press); and of the nations\nthere is no man with me; and I trode them down in wrath,\nand ground them, down as the earth, and brought down their\nblood to the earth. \n 4 For a day of recompense is come upon them, and a year\nof ransom is here. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 And I looked, and there was none that helped; and I was\namazed, and there was none that supported; and mine own arm\nwrought salvation for me, and my fury, it supported me. \n 6 Ahd I trampled the people in mine anger, and made them\ndrunk in my fury, and brought down their life blood to the earth. \n 7 I will recall the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, the praises\nof the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath recompensed\nto us, and the abundance of good toward the house of Israel\nwhich he hath recompensed to them, according to his mercies,\nand according to the abundance of his lovingkindnesses. \n 8 And he said, Only they are my people, sons that will not\ndeal falsely; and he became their Saviour. \n 9 In all their distress he was distressed, and the angel of his\nFace saved them; in his love and in his forbearance he re\ndeemed them; and be lifted them up, and carried them all the\ndays of old. \n 10 And they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit; and he\nturned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them. \n 11 And he remembered the days of old, Moses, his people;\nWhere is he that brought them up out of the sea, with the\nshepherd of his \ufb02ock? Where is he that put his holy Spirit\nwithin him? \n 12 That caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of\nMoses, dividing the waters before them, to make himself an\neverlasting name? \n 13 That caused them to go through the deeps, like a horse\nin the wilderness, without stumbling? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 And I looked on them, and (there was) no helper; and\nI perceived, and no one took hold, and my arm rescued them,\nand my wrath pressed on. \n 6 And I trampled them down with my anger, and brought\ndown their blood to the earth. \n 7 I called to mind the mercy of the Lord, the excellences\nof the Lord in all things which the Lord recompenseth to us.\nThe Lord is an upright judge to the house of Israel, he bringeth\nit upon us according to his mercy and according to the abundance\nof his righteousness. \n 8 And he said, Are they not my people? children, and they\nwill not set at nought; and he was their salvation \n 9 Out of all affliction. It was no messengers, nor angel, but\nthe Lord himself that saved them, because he loved them, and\nspared them; he it was that ransomed them, and took them up,\nand uplifted them all the days of old. \n 10 But they disobeyed, and provoked the holy Spirit; and he\nwas turned to enmity against them, himself fought against them. \n 11 And he remembered the days of old: he that brought\nup from the land the shepherd of the sheep. Where is he that\nput his holy Spirit within them? \n 12 He that led Moses with his right hand? the arm of his\n\u2019 glory? he overcame the water before his face, to make himself\nan everlasting name. \n 13 And he led them through the deep, like a horse through\nthe wilderness, and they wearied not, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 As a beast goeth down \u2019the valley, the Spirit of the\nLORD brought him to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to\nmake thyself a name of beauty. \n 15 Look from heaven, and see from the habitation of thy\nholiness and thy beauty: where is thy jealousy, and thy mighty\nacts? the sounding of thy bowels and thy mercies are restrained\ntowards me. \n 16 For thou art our father; for Abraham knoweth us not,\nIsrael doth not recognize us: thy name is Our Redeemer from\nof old. \n 17 Why dost thou make us stray, O LORD, from thy ways,\nand harden our heart from fearing thee? Return, for thy servants'\nsake, the tribes of thine inheritance. \n 18 Thy holy people have possessed for a little while; our\nadversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. \n 19 We are become as they over whom thou never barest\nrule, upon whom thy name was not called. \n LXIV. 1 O that thou hadst rent the heavens, that thou\nhadst come down, that the mountains had quaked at thy\nPresence! \n 2 As when kindleth brushwood, (as) \ufb01re maketh water\nboil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, (that) nations\nshould tremble at thy presence, \n 3 While thou didst terrible things (which) we hoped not for;\nthat thou hadst come down, the mountains had quaked at thy\npresence! \n 4 And from old they have not heard, have not perceived by\nthe ear, eye hath not seen a God beside thee, who will work for\nhim that waiteth for him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 14 And as beasts through a plain; and a spirit dame down\nfrom the Lord, and guided them; so didst thou lead thy people,\nto make thyself a name of glory. \n 15 Turn thou from heaven, and see from thy holy house, and\n(thy) glory: where is thy jealousy and thy might? where is the\nabundance of thy mercy and thy pitifulness, that thou didst\nbear with us? \n 16 Thou art our father; for Abraham knew us not, and Israel\nrecognized us not ; but thou, Lord, art our father; deliver us, thy\nname is among us from the beginning. \n 17 Why didst thou make us to wander, Lord, from thy way?\ndidst harden our hearts, that we should not fear thee? turn\nunto us, for the sake of thy bondmen, for the sake of the\ntribes of thine inheritance, \n 18 That we may inherit a little of thy holy mountain: our\nadversaries trode down thy sanctuary. \n 19 We are become as at the beginning, when thou didst not\nrule over us, neither was thy name called upon us. \n LXIV. r If thou openest the heaven, trembling shall seize\nthe mountains before thee, and they shall melt, \n 2 As wax melteth from before the \ufb01re; and \ufb01re shall burn\nup thine enemies, and the name of the Lord shall be manifest\namong thine enemies; from before thy face shall nations be\nconfounded, \n 3 When thou doest thy glorious deeds; trembling shall seize\nthe mountains before thee. \n 4 From everlasting have we not heard, nor have our eyes seen\nany God except thee> and thy works which thou wilt do\nthem that wait for mercy. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness\nin thy ways they will remember thee; behold, thou wast wroth,\nand we sinned; in them (have we been) long time, and shall we\nbe saved? \n 6 And we are all become as one unclean, and all our\nrighteousnesses as a polluted garment; and we are all withered\nas the leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, will take us away. \n 7 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that rouseth\nhimself to hold fast by thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us,\nand melted us by the hand of our iniquities. \n 8 And now, LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and\nthou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. \n 9 Be not wroth, O LORD, to the uttermost, and remember not\niniquity for ever; behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all of\nus thy people. \n 10 Thy holy cities are become wilderness, Zion is become\na wildemess, Jerusalem a desolation. \n 11 Our house of holiness and beauty, (in) which our fathers\npraised thee, is burned up with \ufb01re, and all our desirable things\nare laid waste. \n 12 Wilt thou, for all this, refrain thyself, O LORD? wilt thou\nhold thy peace, and affict us to the uttermost ? \n LXV. 1 I was to be inquired of by them that asked not,\nhave let myself be found by them that sought me not; I said,\nHere am I, Here am I, unto a nation that was not called by\nmy name. \n 2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a refractory\npeople, which walk in a way which is not good, after their own\nthoughts. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 For he will meet them that do righteousness, and they shall\nremember thy ways. Behold, thou wast wroth, and We sinned:\ntherefore we strayed, \n 6 And we all became as unclean, all our righteousness as\n\ufb01lthy rags; and we fell away like leaves because of our transgressions;\nso shall a wind bear us away. \n 7 And there is none that calleth on thy name, or remembereth\nto lay hold upon thee; for thou didst turn thy face away from us,\nand didst deliver us over because of our transgressions. \n 8 And now, Lord, thou art our father; and we are clay,\nall (are) the works of thy hands. \n 9 Be not wroth with us exceedingly, and remember not all\nour sins betimes; and now look upon us, for we are all thy\npeople. \n 10 Thy city of the Holy One, Zion, is become desert;\nJerusalem is become as a desert: turned to a curse\nII Is the house, our holy place: and the glory which our\nI fathers blessed is burnt with \ufb01re, and all (our) glorious things\nare fallen together. \n 12 And for all this thou didst refrain, O Lord, and heldest\nthy peace, and didst humble us exceedingly. \n LXV. 1 I became manifest to them that sought me not;\nI was found of them that inquired not of me; I said, Behold\n(here) am I, to the nation which called not my name. \n 2 I spread forth my hands all the day, to a disobedient and\ngainsaying people; to them which walked not by a way which\n- was true, but after their own sins. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 The people that irritate me continually to my face; which\nsacrifice in the gardens, and burn incense upon the bricks: \n 4 Which sit in the graves, and lodge in guarded places, which\neat swine's \ufb02esh, and broth of abominations is in their vessels: \n 5 Which say, Keep to thyself, come not near to me; for I am\nholy to thee. These are a smoke in my nose, a \ufb01re that burneth\nall the day. \n 6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not hold my peace,\nunless I requite, and I will requite into their bosom, \n 7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,\nsaith the LORD; which burned incense on the mountains, and\nreproached me upon the hills: and I will measure their recompense\n\ufb01rst into their bosom. \n 8 Thus saith the LORD, As when the new wine is found in\nthe cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it;\nso will I do for my servants\u2019 sake, not to destroy the whole. \n 9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of\nJudah a possessor of my mountains; and my chosen ones shall\npossess it, and my servants shall (go to) dwell there. \n 10 And Sharon shall become a home for \ufb02ocks, and the valley\nof Achor a resting place for oxen, for my people that have\ninquired of me. \n 11 And as for you, that forsake the LORD, that forget my\nholy mountain, that set in order a table for Fortune, that \ufb01ll\nup a mingled draught for Destiny: \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 3 This people is that which provoketh me continually to my\nface; it is they that sacrifice in the gardens, and burn incense\nupon the bricks to the demons that shall not be: \n 4 And they lie down in the monuments and in the caves for\nthe sake of dreams; they that eat swine's \ufb02esh and broth of\nsacrifies; all their vessels are \ufb01led. \n 5 That say, Hence away from me, draw not near to me, for\nI am clean: these are a smoke of my wrath, a \ufb01re burneththerein\nevery day. \n 6 Behold, it is written before me, I will not be silent, until\nI render into their bosom \n 7 Their iniquities, and (the iniquities) of their fathers, saith\nthe Lord; who burned incense upon the mountains, and reproached\nme upon the hills; I will render their works into their\nown bosom. \n 8 Thus saith the Lord: Like as the grape shall be found\namid the cluster, and they shall say, Hurt it not: for a blessing\nof the Lord is in it: so will I do for the sake of him that serveth\nme, for his sake will I not destroy (them) all. \n 9 And I will bring forth the seed that cometh from Jacob,\nand from Judah, and it shall inherit my holy mountain, and my\nchosen shall inherit it, and my bondmen shall dwell there. \n 10 And there shall be in the forest folds of \ufb02ocks, and the\nvalley of Achor shall be for a resting place for herds, for my\n\u2019 peOple who sought me. \n 11 But ye are they that forsook me, and that forget my holy\nmountain; and prepare a table for the demon, and \ufb01ll a mingled\ndrink to Fortune. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 I will (even) destine you for the sword, and ye shall all\ncrouch down to the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not\nanswer; I spake, and ye did not hear; but did evil before mine\neyes, and chose that in which I took not pleasure. \n 13 Therefore, thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants\nshall eat, and ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall\ndrink, and ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice,\nand ye shall be ashamed: \n 14 Behold, my servants shall sing for happiness of heart, and\nye shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall howl for breaking\nof spirit. \n 15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen\nand the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by\nanother name; \n 16 So that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless\nhimself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the\nearth shall swear by the God of truth; because the \ufb01rst distresses\nare forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. \n 17 For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and\nthe \ufb01rst things shall not be remembered, nor come up into\nthe heart. \n 18 But rejoice ye and exult for ever at that which I create;\nfor behold, I create Jerusalem an exultation, and her people\na joy. \n 19 And I Will exult in Jerusalem, and rejoice in my people,\nand the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor\nthe voice of crying out. \n 20 There shall be no more from thence an infant of days, or\nan old man, that shall not fulfil his days: for the youth a\nhundred years old shall die, and the sinner a hundred years\nold shall be accursed \n 21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they\nshall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. \n \n \n \n\n \n 12 I will deliver you up to a sword, ye shall all fall by\nslaughter: for I called you, and ye hearkened not; I spake, and\nye heard amiss; and did that which was evil before me, and\nchose that which I desired not. \n 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, they that serve me\nshall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold,. they that serve me\nshall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, they that serve me\nshall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed. \n 14 Behold, they that serve me shall exult in joyfulness, but ye\nshall cry out for weariness of your heart, and shall wail because\nof the breaking of spirit. \n 15 For ye shall leave your name for a loathing for my chosen,\nbut you shall the Lord destroy. But they that serve him shall\nbe called by a new name, \n 16 Which shall be blessed upon the earth; for they shall bless\nthe true God, and they that swear upon the earth shall swear\nby the true God. For they shall forget the \ufb01rst affliction, and\nit shall not come up into their heart. \n 17 For the heaven shall be new, and the earth new, and they\nshall not remember the former things, nor shall they come into\ntheir heart. \n 18 But they shall \ufb01nd joy and exultation in her; behold,\nI make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. \n 19 And I will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in my people:\nand no longer Shall there be heard in her the voice of weeping\nand the voice of crying, \n 20 Nor shall there be there one untimely, nor an old man who\nshall not fulfil his time: for the young shall be a hundred years\nold, but he that dieth a sinner shall be a hundred years old, and\nis accursed. \n 21 And they shall build houses, and themselves shall inhabit\nthem; and shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the\nfruits of them \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not\nplant, and another eat; for as the days of the tree are the days\nof my people, and my chosen shall wear out the works of\ntheir hands. \n 23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror;\nfor they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their\noffspring (shall be) with them. \n 24 And it shall be, before they shall call, I will answer; still\nshall they be speaking, and I will hear. \n 25 The wolf and the lamb shall graze together, and the lion\nshall eat straw like the ox; and (as. for) the serpent, dust his\nfood. They shall not do evil nor deal corruptly in all my holy\nmountain, saith the LORD. \n LXVI. I Thus saith the LORD, The heavens are my throne,\nand the earth the footstool of my feet; where is this house ye\nwill build unto me? and where is this place of my rest? \n 2 And all these things hath my hand made, and all these\nthings came to be, saith the LORD; and to this one will I look,\nto him who is afflicted and contrite in spirit, and trembleth at\nmy word. \n 3 He that slaughtereth the ox, slayeth a man; he that\nsacrificeth the sheep, breaketh a \u2019s neck; he that offereth\na meal offering, sweene's blood: he that maketh a memorial of\nincense, blesseth iniquity. Also they have chosen their own\nways, and their soul taketh pleasure in their abominations. \n 4 Also I will choose their mockeries, and will bring their fears\nupon them; because I called, and there was none that answered;\nI spake, and there was none that heard; and they did evil before\nmine eyes, and chose that in which I took not pleasure. \n \n \n\n \n 22 And they shall. not build, and others inhabit; and they\nshall not plant, and others eat. For according to the days of\nthe tree of life are the days of my people; the works of their\nlabours shall they make to grow old. \n 23 And my chosen ones shall not labour in vain, nor bring\nforth children for a curse; for it is a seed blessed by God, and\ntheir offspring shall be with them. \n 24 And it shall be, before they cry out, I will hearken to\nthem; while they are yet speaking, I will say, What is it? \n 25 Then shall wolves and lambs feed together, and a lion\nshall eat chaff as an ox, and a serpent shall eat the earth as\nbread: they shall not do wrong nor hurt upon my holy mountain,\nsaith the Lord. \n LXVI. 1 Thus saith-the Lord, The heaven is my throne,\nand the earth the footstool of my feet; what kind of house will\n\u2019ye build for me? or of what kind is the place of my rest ? \n 2 For all these things hath my hand made; and all these\nthings are mine, saith the Lord; and unto whom shall I look, save\nto him that is humble, and quiet, and trembleth at my words? \n 3 But the transgressor, who sacrificeth to me a bullock, is as\none that slayeth a dog, and he that offereth \ufb01ne \ufb02our as though\nit were swine's blood; he that giveth frankincense for a memorial,\nas a blasphemer; and they chose their own ways, and\ntheir abominations, which their soul desired. \n 4 And I will choose their mockeries, and requite unto them\ntheir sins: for I called them, and they hearkened not unto me;\nI spake, and they heard not: and they did that which was wicked\nbefore me, and chose out things which I willed not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word;\nyour brethren say, that hate you, that drive you away for my\nname's sake, Let the LORD show himself glorious, and we shall\nsee your joy; and they shall be ashamed. \n 6 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple,\na voice of the LORD rendering retribution to his enemies. \n 7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before pain came to\nher, she was delivered of a man child. \n 8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things?\nShall a land be travailed with in one day? shall a nation be born\nat once? for Zion travailed, she also brought forth her sons. \n 9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?\nsaith the LORD; shall I, that cause to bring forth, shut up (the\nwomb)? saith thy God. \n 10 Be ye glad with Jerusalem, and exult in her, all ye that love\nher: rejoice with her, all that mourn with her. \n 11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied from the breast of her\nconsolations: that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves from\nthe fulness of her glory. \n 12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I extend to her peace\nlike a river, and the glory of nations like an \ufb02owing stream:\nand ye shall suck; ye shall be borne upon the side, be\nfondled upon the knees. \n 13 As a man whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort\nyou: and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. \n 14 And ye shall see this, and your heart shall rejoice, and your\nbones shall shoot up like the young grass; and the hand of the\nLORD shall make itself known toward his servants, and he shall\nbe indignant toward his enemies. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 5 Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word;\nspeak, our brethren, to them that hate us and hold (us) in\nabomination, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and\nmay be seen in their joy; and they shall be ashamed. \n 6 A voice of crying from the city, a voice from the temple,\na voice of the Lord requiting a requital to them that resist him. \n 7 Before the travailing woman brought forth, before the pain\nof her pangs came, she escaped, and bare a man-child. \n 8 Who (hath) heard such a thing, and who hath seen it so?\ndid the earth travail in one day, was a nation ever born at once?\nfor Zion travailed, and she brought forth her children. \n 9 But it was I that gave thee this expectation, and thou\nremerriberedst me not, saith the Lord: behold, is it not I that\nmake the fruitful and the barren? saith thy God. \n 10 Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and keep solemn assembly, all ye\nthat dwell in her; rejoice with joy, all ye that mourn over her. \n 11 That ye may suck, and be \ufb01lled from the breast of her\nconsolation; that ye may suck out, and take delight from the\nentering in of her glory. \n 12 For thus saith the Lord: Behold, I do incline toward them\nlike a river of peace, and like a torrent overflowing the glory of\nnations: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and on\nthe knees shall they be comforted, \n 13 As whomsoever a mother shall comfort; for so will I also\ncomfort you, and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted. \n 14 And your heart shall see and rejoice, and your bones shall\ngrow up as herbage: and the hand of the Lord shall be made\nknown to them that worship him, and he shall threaten the\ndisobedient. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 For behold, the LORD shall come in \ufb01re, and his chariots\nlike a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke\nwith \ufb02ames of \ufb01re. \n 16 For with \ufb01re will the LORD enter into judgment, and\nwith his sword with all \ufb02esh; and the smitten of the LORD\nshall be many. \n 17 They that hallow themselves, and purify themselves for\nthe gardens behind one in the midst, eating swine's \ufb02esh, and\nthe abomination, and the mouse, shall come to an end together,\nsaith the LORD. \n 18 And I . . . . . . their works and their thoughts: it cometh,\nto gather all nations and tongues: and they shall come, and see\nmy glory. \n 19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send the\nescaped of them unto the nations, Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that\ndraw the bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles afar off, that have not\nheard my message, neither have seen my glory; and they shall\ntell my glory among the nations. \n 20 And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations,\na (meal) offering unto the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots,\nand in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my\nholy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of\nIsrael bring the (meal) offering in a clean vessel to the house\nof the LORD. \n 21 And also of them will I take for the priests, for the\nLevites, saith the LORD. \n 22 For as the. new heavens and the new earth, which I make,\nstand before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your\nname stand. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15 For behold, the Lord shall come as a \ufb01re, and his chariots\nas a whirlwind, to render vengeance in wrath, and utter rejection\nin a \ufb02ame of \ufb01re. \n 16 For by the \ufb01re of the Lord shall all the earth be judged,\nand all \ufb02esh by his sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord. \n 17 They that hallow and purify themselves for the gardens,\nand eat swine's \ufb02esh, and their abominations, and the mouse, in\nthe forecourts, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord. \n 18 And I (know) their works, and their reasoning; I am\ncoming to gather together all the nations and the tongues, and\nthey shall come, and shall see my glory. \n 19 And I will leave signs upon them, and I will send forth\nfrom them those that are saved to the nations, to Tarshish, and\nPhut, and Lud, and Meshech, and Tubal, and to Greece, and\nto the isles afar off; men who have not heard my name,\nI neither have seen my glory: and they shall declare my glory\namong the nations. \n 20 And they shall bring your brethren out of all the nations\nfor a gift to the LORD, with horses and chariots, in mule-chariots\nwith awnings, into the holy city Jerusalem, saith the Lord, that\nthe children of Israel may bring their sacrifices to me with\npsalms, into the house of the Lord. \n 21 And from them will I take me priests and Levites, saith\nthe Lord. \n 22 For like as the heaven (is) new, and the earth (is) new,\n\u2019which I make remaineth before me, saith the Lord: so\nshall your seed and your name stand. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 23 And it shall be, from new moon to new moon, and from\nsabbath to sabbath, shall all \ufb02esh come to worship before me,\nsaith the LORD. \n 24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of\nthe men that have rebelled against me: for their worm shall\nnot die, and their \ufb01re shall not be quenched; and they shall\nbe a horror unto all \ufb02esh. \n\n \n 23 And it shall be, for month after month, and sabbath after\nsabbath, all \ufb02esh shall come before me to worship at Jerusalem,\nsaith the Lord. \n 24 And they shall go forth, and shall see the limbs of the\nmen \u2019that have transgressed against me: for their worm doth\nnot cease, and their \ufb01re shall not be quenched: and they shall\nbe for a spectacle to all \ufb02esh. \n \n \n"},"commit":"321cc9ffb8ee31d68a1bccc00e0d89ec8ab029ca"}
